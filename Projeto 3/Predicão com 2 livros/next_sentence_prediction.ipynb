              "'Adventure 1.\\nA Scandal in Bohemia.\\n1.\\nTo Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him\\nmention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\\npredominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin\\nto love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were\\nabhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take\\nit, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has\\nseen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He\\nnever spoke of the softer passions, save with a\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 3\\ngibe and a sneer.They were admirable things for the observer— excellent\\nfor drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained\\nreasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted\\ntemperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a\\ndoubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack\\nin one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a\\nstrong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to\\nhim, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable\\nmemory.\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from\\neach other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests\\nwhich rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own\\nestablishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes,\\nwho loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained\\nin our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating\\nfrom week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the\\ndrug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever,\\ndeeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties\\nand extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and\\nclearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the\\nofficial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings:\\nof his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing\\nup of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\\nfinally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his\\nactivity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily\\npress, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\\nOne night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a\\njourney to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way\\nled me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which\\nmust always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark\\nincidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see\\nHolmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary\\npowers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his\\ntall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was\\npacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his\\nhands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his\\nattitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had\\nrisen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some\\nnew problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had\\nformerly been in part my own.\\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see\\nme. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an\\narmchair, threw across his case\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 5\\nof cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he\\nstood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective\\nfashion.\\n“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put on\\nseven and a half pounds since I saw you.”\\n“Seven!” I answered.\\n“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy,\\nWatson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you\\nintended to go into harness.”\\n“Then, how do you know?”\\n“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself\\nvery wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?”\\n“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have been\\nburned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country\\nwalk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed\\nmy clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is\\nincorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see\\nhow you work it out.”\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\\n“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside of your\\nleft shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six\\nalmost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has\\nvery carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove\\ncrusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had\\nbeen out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant bootslitting\\nspecimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman\\nwalks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of\\nsilver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat\\nto show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I\\ndo not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of\\ndeduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked, “the thing\\nalways appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it\\nmyself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled\\nuntil you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good\\nas yours.”\\n“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down\\ninto an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.\\nFor example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the\\nhall to this room.”\\n“Frequently.”\\n“How often?”\\n“Well, some hundreds of times.”\\n“Then how many are there?”\\n“How many? I don’t know.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 7\\n“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my\\npoint. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen\\nand observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these little problems,\\nand since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling\\nexperiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of thick,\\npink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table. “It came\\nby the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\n“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it said, “a\\ngentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest\\nmoment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have\\nshown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of\\nan importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we\\nhave from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and\\ndo not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.”\\n“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it\\nmeans?”\\n“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.\\nInsensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to\\nsuit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?”\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\\n“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\\nendeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not\\nbe bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.”\\n“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English paper\\nat all. Hold it up to the light.”\\nI did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G” with a\\nsmall “t” woven into the texture of the paper.\\n“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\\n“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\\n“Not at all.The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the\\nGerman for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of\\ncourse, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us glance at our\\nContinental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume from his\\nshelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking\\ncountry—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable as being the\\nscene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and\\npaper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?” His eyes\\nsparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\\n“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\\n“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\\npeculiar construction of the sentence—’This\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 9\\naccount of you we have from all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or\\nRussian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous\\nto his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this\\nGerman who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to\\nshowing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all\\nour doubts.”\\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheels\\nagainst the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.\\n“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of the\\nwindow. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty\\nguineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing\\nelse.”\\n“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”\\n“Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And\\nthis promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”\\n“But your client—”\\n“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit\\ndown in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\\npassage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\\nauthoritative tap.\\n“Come in!” said Holmes.\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in\\nheight, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a\\nrichness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste.\\nHeavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his\\ndouble-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his\\nshoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a\\nbrooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended\\nhalfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown\\nfur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by\\nhis whole appearance. He carried a broadbrimmed hat in his hand, while he\\nwore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones,\\na black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,\\nfor his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the\\nface he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\\nand a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of\\nobstinacy.\\n“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\\nmarked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from one\\nto the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\n“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr.\\nWatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\\nhave I the honour to address?”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 11\\n“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\\nunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\\ndiscretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance.\\nIf not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.”\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\\nmy chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this gentleman\\nanything which you may say to me.”\\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he, “by\\nbinding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time\\nthe matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that\\nit is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.”\\n“I promise,” said Holmes.\\n“And I.”\\n“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor.\\n“The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to\\nyou, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called\\nmyself is not exactly my own.”\\n“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.\\n“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be\\ntaken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously\\ncompromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the\\nmatter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of\\nBohemia.”\\n“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his\\narmchair and closing his eyes.\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging\\nfigure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most\\nincisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly\\nreopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\\n“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I\\nshould be better able to advise you.”\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\\nuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the\\nmask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,” he cried;\\n“I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?”\\n“Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken before I\\nwas aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of CasselFelstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.”\\n“But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once more\\nand passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can understand that\\nI am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the\\nmatter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting\\nmyself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of\\nconsulting you.”\\n“Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 13\\n“The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to\\nWarsaw, I made the acquaintance of the wellknown adventuress, Irene\\nAdler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.”\\n“Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes without\\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all\\nparagraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a\\nsubject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In\\nthis case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew\\nrabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the\\ndeep-sea fishes.\\n“Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.\\nContralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—\\nyes! Retired from operatic stage— ha! Living in London—quite so! Your\\nMajesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote\\nher some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters\\nback.”\\n“Precisely so. But how—”\\n“Was there a secret marriage?”\\n“None.”\\n“No legal papers or certificates?”\\n“None.”\\n“Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person\\nshould produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\\nprove their authenticity?”\\n“There is the writing.”\\n“Pooh, pooh! Forgery.”\\n“My private note-paper.”\\n“Stolen.”\\n“My own seal.”\\n“Imitated.”\\n“My photograph.”\\n“Bought.”\\n“We were both in the photograph.”\\n“Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\\nindiscretion.”\\n“I was mad—insane.”\\n“You have compromised yourself seriously.”\\n“I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty\\nnow.”\\n“It must be recovered.”\\n“We have tried and failed.”\\n“Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.”\\n“She will not sell.”\\n“Stolen, then.”\\n“Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay\\nransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled.\\nTwice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.”\\n“No sign of it?”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 15\\n“Absolutely none.”\\nHolmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he.\\n“But a very serious one to me,” returned the King reproachfully.\\n“Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?”\\n“To ruin me.”\\n“But how?”\\n“I am about to be married.”\\n“So I have heard.”\\n“To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\\nScandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is\\nherself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct\\nwould bring the matter to an end.”\\n“And Irene Adler?”\\n“Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she\\nwill do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face\\nof the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men.\\nRather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which\\nshe would not go—none.”\\n“You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”\\n“I am sure.”\\n“And why?”\\n“Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal\\nwas publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.”\\n“Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmes with a yawn. “That is very\\nfortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at\\npresent. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?”\\n“Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count\\nVon Kramm.”\\n“Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.”\\n“Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.”\\n“Then, as to money?”\\n“You have carte blanche.”\\n“Absolutely?”\\n“I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have\\nthat photograph.”\\n“And for present expenses?”\\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it\\non the table.\\n“There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he\\nsaid.\\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to\\nhim.\\n“And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked.\\n“Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 17\\nHolmes took a note of it. “One other question,” said he. “Was the\\nphotograph a cabinet?”\\n“It was.”\\n“Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some\\ngood news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheels of\\nthe royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be good enough to\\ncall to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like to chat this little\\nmatter over with you.”\\n2.\\nAt three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet\\nreturned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after\\neight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the\\nintention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply\\ninterested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim\\nand strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I\\nhave already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of\\nhis client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made\\nit a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick,\\nsubtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries.\\nSo accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his\\nfailing had ceased to enter into my head.\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\\ngroom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\\ndisreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my\\nfriend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times\\nbefore I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the\\nbedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable,\\nas of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in\\nfront of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.\\n“Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was\\nobliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\\n“What is it?”\\n“It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my\\nmorning, or what I ended by doing.”\\n“I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and\\nperhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.”\\n“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left\\nthe house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the character of a\\ngroom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among\\nhorsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I\\nsoon\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 19\\nfound Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built\\nout in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large\\nsitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to\\nthe floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child\\ncould open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage\\nwindow could be reached from the top of the coachhouse. I walked round it\\nand examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting\\nanything else of interest.\\n“I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a\\nmews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers\\na hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a\\nglass of half and half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as\\nI could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people\\nin the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose\\nbiographies I was compelled to listen to.”\\n“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.\\n“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the\\ndaintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews,\\nto a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day,\\nand returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except\\nwhen she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is\\ndark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often\\ntwice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages\\nof a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from\\nSerpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they\\nhad to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and\\nto think over my plan of campaign.\\n“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He\\nwas a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them,\\nand what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or\\nhis mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to\\nhis keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question\\ndepended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my\\nattention to the gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point,\\nand it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\\ndetails, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to\\nunderstand the situation.”\\n“I am following you closely,” I answered.\\n“I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to\\nBriony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome\\nman, dark, aquiline, and moustached— evidently the man of whom I had\\nheard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait,\\nand brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who\\nwas thoroughly at home.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 21\\n“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him\\nin the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly,\\nand waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged,\\nlooking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he\\npulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, ‘Drive like\\nthe devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross & Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then\\nto the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do\\nit in twenty minutes!’\\n“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to\\nfollow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with\\nhis coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of\\nhis harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t pulled up before she\\nshot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the\\nmoment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\\n“‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if you\\nreach it in twenty minutes.’\\n“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I\\nshould run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab\\ncame through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I\\njumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St. Monica,’ said I, ‘and\\nhalf a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ It was twentyfive\\nminutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\\n“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others were\\nthere before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in\\nfront of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church.\\nThere was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a\\nsurpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were\\nall three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle\\nlike any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my\\nsurprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came\\nrunning as hard as he could towards me.\\n“‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come! Come!’\\n“‘What then?’ I asked.\\n“‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’\\n“I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found\\nmyself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching\\nfor things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure\\ntying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all\\ndone in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side\\nand the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It\\nwas the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life,\\nand it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that\\nthere had been\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 23\\nsome informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused\\nto marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky\\nappearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in\\nsearch of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it\\non my watchchain in memory of the occasion.”\\n“This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and what then?”\\n“Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair\\nmight take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and\\nenergetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they\\nseparated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I shall\\ndrive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said as she left him. I heard no\\nmore. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my\\nown arrangements.”\\n“Which are?”\\n“Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell. “I have\\nbeen too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this\\nevening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.”\\n“I shall be delighted.”\\n“You don’t mind breaking the law?”\\n“Not in the least.”\\n“Nor running a chance of arrest?”\\n“Not in a good cause.”\\n“Oh, the cause is excellent!”\\n“Then I am your man.”\\n“I was sure that I might rely on you.”\\n“But what is it you wish?”\\n“When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.\\nNow,” he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had\\nprovided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is\\nnearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss\\nIrene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at\\nBriony Lodge to meet her.”\\n“And what then?”\\n“You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There\\nis only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what\\nmay. You understand?”\\n“I am to be neutral?”\\n“To do nothing whatever.There will probably be some small\\nunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the\\nhouse. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open.\\nYou are to station yourself close to that open window.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give\\nyou to throw, and will, at the same time, raise\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 25\\nthe cry of fire. You quite follow me?”\\n“Entirely.”\\n“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar- shaped roll\\nfrom his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke- rocket, fitted with a\\ncap at either end to make it selflighting. Your task is confined to that. When\\nyou raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people.\\nYou may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten\\nminutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?”\\n“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the\\nsignal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at\\nthe corner of the street.”\\n“Precisely.”\\n“Then you may entirely rely on me.”\\n“That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I\\nprepare for the new role I have to play.”\\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the\\ncharacter of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His\\nbroad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and\\ngeneral look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John\\nHare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his\\ncostume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with\\nevery fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science\\nlost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.\\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten\\nminutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was\\nalready dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and\\ndown in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The\\nhouse was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’ succinct\\ndescription, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On\\nthe contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably\\nanimated.There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing\\nin a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were\\nflirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were\\nlounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.\\n“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house,\\n“this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a doubleedged\\nweapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being\\nseen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his\\nprincess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?”\\n“Where, indeed?”\\n“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too\\nlarge for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows that the King\\nis capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort\\nhave already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it\\nabout\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 27\\nwith her.”\\n“Where, then?”\\n“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility.\\nBut I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they\\nlike to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?\\nShe could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or\\npolitical influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides,\\nremember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be\\nwhere she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.”\\n“But it has twice been burgled.”\\n“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\\n“But how will you look?”\\n“I will not look.”\\n“What then?”\\n“I will get her to show me.”\\n“But she will refuse.”\\n“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It\\nis her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”\\nAs he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the curve\\nof the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of\\nBriony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed\\nforward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed\\naway by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A\\nfierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who\\ntook sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was\\nequally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the\\nlady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of\\nflushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their\\nfists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just\\nas he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood\\nrunning freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels\\nin one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of betterdressed\\npeople, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\\ncrowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as\\nI will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her\\nsuperb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the\\nstreet.\\n“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked. “He is dead,” cried several\\nvoices.\\n“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be\\ngone before you can get him to hospital.”\\n“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had\\nthe lady’s purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were\\na gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.” “He can’t lie in the\\nstreet. May we bring him in, marm?” “Surely. Bring him into the sittingroom.\\nThere is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 29\\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\\nprincipal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the\\nwindow. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that\\nI could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was\\nseized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I\\nknow that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than\\nwhen I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the\\ngrace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet\\nit would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the\\npart which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the\\nsmokerocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring\\nher. We are but preventing her from injuring another.\\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is\\nin need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the\\nsame instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket\\ninto the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out of my\\nmouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill—\\ngentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids—joined in a general shriek of “Fire!”\\nThick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open\\nwindow. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice\\nof Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping\\nthrough the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and\\nin ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm in mine, and to get\\naway from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some\\nfew minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead\\ntowards the Edgeware Road.\\n“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been\\nbetter. It is all right.”\\n“You have the photograph?”\\n“I know where it is.”\\n“And how did you find out?”\\n“She showed me, as I told you she would.”\\n“I am still in the dark.”\\n“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was\\nperfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an\\naccomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\\n“I guessed as much.”\\n“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of\\nmy hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and\\nbecame a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\\n“That also I could fathom.”\\n“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\\nshe do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\\nsuspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see\\nwhich. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 31\\nopen the window, and you had your chance.”\\n“How did that help you?”\\n“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house\\nis on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most.\\nIt is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\\nadvantage of it. In the case of the Darlington substitution scandal it was of\\nuse to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman\\ngrabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was\\nclear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious\\nto her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm\\nof fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake\\nnerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess\\nbehind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an\\ninstant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she halfdrew it out. When I cried out\\nthat it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from\\nthe room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses,\\nescaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the\\nphotograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching\\nme narrowly it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin\\nall.”\\n“And now?” I asked.\\n“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and\\nwith you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sittingroom\\nto wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may\\nfind neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty\\nto regain it with his own hands.”\\n“And when will you call?”\\n“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear\\nfield. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete\\nchange in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.”\\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching\\nhis pockets for the key when someone passing said:\\n“Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.”\\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\\nappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\\n“I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit\\nstreet. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.”\\n3.\\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and\\ncoffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\\n“You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 33\\nby either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face. “Not yet.”\\n“But you have hopes?”\\n“I have hopes.”\\n“Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.” “We must have a cab.”\\n“No, my brougham is waiting.”\\n“Then that will simplify matters.” We descended and started\\noff once more for Briony Lodge.\\n“Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes.\\n“Married! When?”\\n“Yesterday.”\\n“But to whom?”\\n“To an English lawyer named Norton.”\\n“But she could not love him.”\\n“I am in hopes that she does.”\\n“And why in hopes?”\\n“Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the\\nlady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love\\nyour Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your\\nMajesty’s plan.”\\n“It is true. And yet—Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a\\nqueen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence, which was\\nnot broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the\\nsteps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\\nbrougham.\\n“Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she.\\n“I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a\\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\\n“Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this\\nmorning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the\\nContinent.”\\n“What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise.\\n“Do you mean that she has left England?”\\n“Never to return.”\\n“And the papers?” asked the King hoarsely. “All is lost.”\\n“We shall see.” He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawingroom,\\nfollowed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about\\nin every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady\\nhad hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bellpull,\\ntore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out\\na photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in\\nevening dress, the letter was superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be\\nleft till called for.” My friend tore it open and we all three read it together. It\\nwas dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\\n“MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well.\\nYou took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a\\nsuspicion. But then, when I found\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 35\\nhow I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you\\nmonths ago. I had been told that if the King employed an agent it would\\ncertainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this,\\nyou made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\\nsuspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman.\\nBut, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is\\nnothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I\\nsent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walkingclothes,\\nas I call them, and came down just as you departed.\\n“Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an\\nobject of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather\\nimprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my\\nhusband.\\n“We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so\\nformidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call tomorrow.\\nAs to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am\\nloved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without\\nhindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to\\nsafeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me\\nfrom any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph\\nwhich he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\n“Very truly yours,\\n“IRENE NORTON, née ADLER.\\n“What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia, when\\nwe had all three read this epistle. “Did I not tell you how quick and resolute\\nshe was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that\\nshe was not on my level?”\\n“From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very\\ndifferent level to your Majesty,” said Holmes coldly. “I am sorry that I have\\nnot been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more successful\\nconclusion.”\\n“On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King; “nothing could be more\\nsuccessful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe\\nas if it were in the fire.”\\n“I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.”\\n“I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward\\nyou. This ring—” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and\\nheld it out upon the palm of his hand.\\n“Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,” said\\nHolmes.\\n“You have but to name it.”\\n“This photograph!”\\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\\n“Irene’s photograph!” he cried. “Certainly, if you wish it.”\\n“I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I\\nhave the honour to wish you a very good-morning.” He bowed, and, turning\\naway without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him,\\nhe set off in my\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 37\\ncompany for his chambers.\\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of\\nBohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a\\nwoman’s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I\\nhave not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or\\nwhen he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of\\nthe woman.\\nAdventure 2.\\nThe Red-headed League.\\nI had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn\\nof last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, floridfaced,\\nelderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my\\nintrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into\\nthe room and closed the door behind me.\\n“You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,” he\\nsaid cordially.\\n“I was afraid that you were engaged.”\\n“So I am. Very much so.”\\n“Then I can wait in the next room.”\\n“Not at all.This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in\\nmany of my most successful cases, and I have\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 39\\nno doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.”\\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting,\\nwith a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.\\n“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his\\nfingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “I know, my\\ndear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the\\nconventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your\\nrelish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if\\nyou will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own\\nlittle adventures.”\\n“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,”\\nI observed.\\n“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just be\\nfore we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss\\nMary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary\\ncombinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more\\ndaring than any effort of the imagination.”\\n“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.” “You did, Doctor, but\\nnone the less you must come round\\nto my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact\\non you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to\\nbe right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been\\ngood enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a\\nnarrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have\\nlistened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and\\nmost unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the\\nsmaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt\\nwhether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard it is\\nimpossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or\\nnot, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have\\never listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to\\nrecommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr.\\nWatson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature\\nof the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.\\nAs a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events,\\nI am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which\\noccur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to\\nadmit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.” The portly client\\npuffed out his chest with an appearance\\nof some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper\\nfrom the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down\\nthe advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and\\nthe paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at\\nthe man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion,\\nto read the indications which might be presented by his dress\\nor appearance.\\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 41\\nvisitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British\\ntradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey\\nshepherd’s check trousers, a not over-clean black frockcoat, unbuttoned in\\nthe front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a\\nsquare pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat\\nand a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair\\nbeside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable\\nabout the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme\\nchagrin and discontent upon his features.\\nSherlock Holmes’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head\\nwith a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the obvious\\nfacts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that\\nhe is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a\\nconsiderable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”\\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper,\\nbut his eyes upon my companion.\\n“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?” he\\nasked. “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It’s as\\ntrue as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”\\n“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your\\nleft. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.”\\n“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”\\n“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially\\nas, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass\\nbreastpin.”\\n“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”\\n“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches,\\nand the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it\\nupon the desk?”\\n“Well, but China?”\\n“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could\\nonly have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks\\nand have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of\\nstaining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China.\\nWhen, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the\\nmatter becomes even more simple.”\\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he. “I thought at\\nfirst that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in\\nit, after all.”\\n“I begin to think, Watson,” said Holmes, “that I make a mistake in\\nexplaining. ‘Omne ignotum pro magnifico,’ you know, and my poor little\\nreputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not\\nfind the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?”\\n“Yes, I have got it now,” he answered with his thick red finger planted\\nhalfway down the column. “Here it is. This is what began it all. You just\\nread it for yourself, sir.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 43\\nI took the paper from him and read as follows: “TO THE RED-HEADED\\nLEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of\\nLebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which\\nentitles a member of the League to a salary of 4 pounds a week for purely\\nnominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and\\nabove the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on\\nMonday, at eleven o’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7\\nPope’s Court, Fleet Street.”\\n“What on earth does this mean?” I ejaculated after I had twice read over the\\nextraordinary announcement.\\nHolmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high\\nspirits. “It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?” said he. “And now, Mr.\\nWilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household,\\nand the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will\\nfirst make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date.”\\n“It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.”\\n“Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?”\\n“Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said\\nJabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; “I have a small pawnbroker’s business\\nat Coburg Square, near the City. It’s not a very large affair, and of late years\\nit has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two\\nassistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but\\nthat he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business.”\\n“What is the name of this obliging youth?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n“His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either. It’s hard\\nto say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I\\nknow very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able\\nto give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his\\nhead?”\\n“Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employé who comes\\nunder the full market price. It is not a common experience among\\nemployers in this age. I don’t know that your assistant is not as remarkable\\nas your advertisement.”\\n“Oh, he has his faults, too,” said Mr. Wilson. “Never was such a fellow for\\nphotography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving\\nhis mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to\\ndevelop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he’s a good\\nworker. There’s no vice in him.”\\n“He is still with you, I presume?”\\n“Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and\\nkeeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a widower\\nand never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we\\nkeep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 45\\n“The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came\\ndown into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his\\nhand, and he says:\\n“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’\\n“‘Why that?’ I asks.\\n“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed\\nMen. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I\\nunderstand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the\\ntrustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money. If my hair would\\nonly change colour, here’s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.’\\n“‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-athome\\nman, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it,\\nI was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that\\nway I didn’t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always\\nglad of a bit of news.\\n“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked\\nwith his eyes open.\\n“‘Never.’\\n“‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the\\nvacancies.’\\n“‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.\\n“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need\\nnot interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’\\n“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the\\nbusiness has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of\\nhundred would have been very handy.\\n“‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.\\n“‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for yourself\\nthat the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should\\napply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by\\nan American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his\\nways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all redheaded\\nmen; so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous\\nfortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the\\nproviding of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear\\nit is splendid pay and very little to do.’\\n“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would\\napply.’\\n“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘You see it is really\\nconfined to Londoners, and to grown men.This American had started from\\nLondon when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.\\nThen, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red,\\nor dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared\\nto apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly\\nbe worth your while to put yourself out of\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 47\\nthe way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’\\n“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves,\\nthat my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to\\nme that if there was to be any competition in the matter I\\nstood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent\\nSpaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he\\nmight prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters\\nfor the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a\\nholiday, so we shut the business up and started\\noff for the address that was given us in the advertisement. “I never hope to\\nsee such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes.\\nFrom north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade\\nof red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.\\nFleet Street was choked with red-headed folk,\\nand Pope’s Court looked like a coster’s orange barrow. I should\\nnot have thought there were so many in the whole country as\\nwere brought together by that single advertisement. Every\\nshade of colour they were—straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irishsetter, liver,\\nclay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many\\nwho had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how\\nmany were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but\\nSpaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not\\nimagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me\\nthrough the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the\\noffice. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going\\nup in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in\\nas well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.” “Your\\nexperience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes as his\\nclient paused and refreshed his memory\\nwith a huge pinch of snuff. “Pray continue your very interesting statement.”\\n“There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden\\nchairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a\\nhead that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to\\neach candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to\\nfind some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting\\na vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all.\\nHowever, when our turn came the little man was much more\\nfavourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the\\ndoor as we entered, so that he might have a private word with\\nus.\\n“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is\\nwilling to fill a vacancy in the League.’\\n“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He\\nhas every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.’\\nHe took a step backward, cocked his head on\\none side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then\\nsuddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me\\nwarmly on my success.\\n“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am sure,\\nexcuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’\\nWith that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 49\\nuntil I yelled with the pain. ‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he as he\\nreleased me. ‘I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful,\\nfor we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you\\ntales of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He\\nstepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice\\nthat the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from\\nbelow, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was\\nnot a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\\n“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the\\npensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married\\nman, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’\\n“I answered that I had not.\\n“His face fell immediately.\\n“‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I\\nam sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation\\nand spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is\\nexceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’\\n“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to\\nhave the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he\\nsaid that it would be all right.\\n“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but we must\\nstretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When\\nshall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’\\n“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I.\\n“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding. ‘I should\\nbe able to look after that for you.’\\n“‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.\\n“‘Ten to two.’\\n“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes,\\nespecially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it\\nwould suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew\\nthat my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that\\nturned up.\\n“‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’\\n“‘Is 4 pounds a week.’\\n“‘And the work?’\\n“‘Is purely nominal.’\\n“‘What do you call purely nominal?’\\n“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole\\ntime. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very\\nclear upon that point. You don’t comply with the conditions if you budge\\nfrom the office during that time.’\\n“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said I.\\n“‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross; ‘neither sickness nor\\nbusiness nor anything else. There you must stay, or\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 51\\nyou lose your billet.’\\n“‘And the work?’\\n“‘Is to copy out the “Encyclopaedia Britannica.” There is\\nthe first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and\\nblotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready tomorrow?’\\n“‘Certainly,’ I answered.\\n“‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once\\nmore on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to\\ngain.’ He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant,\\nhardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good\\nfortune.\\n“Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits\\nagain; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some\\ngreat hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It\\nseemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that\\nthey would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the\\n‘Encyclopaedia Britannica.’ Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer\\nme up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing.\\nHowever, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I\\nbought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of\\nfoolscap paper, I started off for Pope’s Court.\\n“Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.The\\ntable was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I\\ngot fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me;\\nbut he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At\\ntwo o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I\\nhad written, and locked the door of the office after me.\\n“This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager\\ncame in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work. It\\nwas the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was\\nthere at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross\\ntook to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not\\ncome in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an\\ninstant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a\\ngood one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.\\n“Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and\\nArchery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence\\nthat I might get on to the B’s before very long. It cost me something in\\nfoolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then\\nsuddenly the whole business came to an end.”\\n“To an end?”\\n“Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten\\no’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard\\nhammered on to the middle\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 53\\nof the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself.”\\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of notepaper.\\nIt read in this fashion:\\nTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS\\nDISSOLVED.\\nOctober 9, 1890.\\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face\\nbehind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped\\nevery other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.\\n“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client, flushing up\\nto the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothing better than laugh at\\nme, I can go elsewhere.”\\n“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had\\nhalf risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. It is most\\nrefreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so,\\nsomething just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when\\nyou found the card upon the door?”\\n“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices\\nround, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went\\nto the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and I asked\\nhim if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He\\nsaid that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr.\\nDuncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.\\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’\\n“‘What, the red-headed man?’\\n“‘Yes.’\\n“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a\\nsolicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new\\npremises were ready. He moved out yesterday.’ “‘Where could I find him?’\\n“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward\\nStreet, near St. Paul’s.’\\n“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a\\nmanufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either\\nMr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”\\n“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.\\n“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant.\\nBut he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I\\nshould hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did\\nnot wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you\\nwere good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I\\ncame right away to you.”\\n“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an exceedingly\\nremarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have\\ntold me I think that it is possible that\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 55\\ngraver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.” “Grave\\nenough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost\\nfour pound a week.”\\n“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes,\\n“I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league.\\nOn the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer\\nby some 30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge\\nwhich you have gained on every subject which comes under\\nthe letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”\\n“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they\\nare, and what their object was in playing this prank—if it was\\na prank—upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for\\nit cost them two and thirty pounds.”\\n“We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And,\\nfirst, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours\\nwho first called your attention to the advertisement—how long\\nhad he been with you?”\\n“About a month then.”\\n“How did he come?”\\n“In answer to an advertisement.”\\n“Was he the only applicant?”\\n“No, I had a dozen.”\\n“Why did you pick him?”\\n“Because he was handy and would come cheap.” “At half-wages, in fact.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”\\n“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his\\nface, though he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid\\nupon his forehead.”\\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I\\nthought as much,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his\\nears are pierced for earrings?”\\n“Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when\\nhe was a lad.”\\n“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is\\nstill with you?”\\n“Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.”\\n“And has your business been attended to in your absence?” “Nothing to\\ncomplain of, sir. There’s never very much to do\\nof a morning.”\\n“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an\\nopinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day\\nis Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a\\nconclusion.”\\n“Well, Watson,” said Holmes when our visitor had left us,\\n“what do you make of it all?”\\n“I make nothing of it,” I answered frankly. “It is a most\\nmysterious business.”\\n“As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the\\nless mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes\\nwhich are really puzzling, just as a common\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 57\\nplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this\\nmatter.”\\n“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.\\n“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that\\nyou won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up in his chair,\\nwith his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his\\neyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some\\nstrange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and\\nindeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with\\nthe gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon\\nthe mantelpiece.\\n“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked. “What\\ndo you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?”\\n“I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.”\\n“Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we\\ncan have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of\\nGerman music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than\\nItalian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!”\\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk\\ntook us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we\\nhad listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place,\\nwhere four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small\\nrailed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded\\nlaurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial\\natmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with “JABEZ WILSON” in\\nwhite letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our redheaded\\nclient carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it\\nwith his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining\\nbrightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and\\nthen down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he\\nreturned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the\\npavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and\\nknocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young\\nfellow, who asked him to step in.\\n“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go\\nfrom here to the Strand.”\\n“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\\n“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He is, in my\\njudgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure\\nthat he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.”\\n“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in this\\nmystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way\\nmerely in order that you might see him.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 59\\n“Not him.”\\n“What then?”\\n“The knees of his trousers.”\\n“And what did you see?”\\n“What I expected to see.”\\n“Why did you beat the pavement?”\\n“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk.\\nWe are spies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg\\nSquare. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”\\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from\\nthe retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the\\nfront of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which\\nconveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was\\nblocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide\\ninward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying\\nswarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of\\nfine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the\\nother side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\\n“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the\\nline, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a\\nhobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer’s,\\nthe tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City\\nand Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane’s\\ncarriagebuilding depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now,\\nDoctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had some play. A sandwich\\nand a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and\\ndelicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with\\ntheir conundrums.”\\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very\\ncapable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he\\nsat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his\\nlong, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his\\nlanguid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuthhound,\\nHolmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was\\npossible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately\\nasserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I\\nhave often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood\\nwhich occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him\\nfrom extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was\\nnever so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in\\nhis armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it\\nwas that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his\\nbrilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those\\nwho were unacquainted with his meth\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 61\\nods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that\\nof other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music\\nat St. James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those\\nwhom he had set himself to hunt down.\\n“You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,” he remarked as we emerged.\\n“Yes, it would be as well.”\\n“And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business\\nat Coburg Square is serious.”\\n“Why serious?”\\n“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe\\nthat we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather\\ncomplicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”\\n“At what time?”\\n“Ten will be early enough.”\\n“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”\\n“Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly\\nput your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand, turned on his\\nheel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always\\noppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock\\nHolmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen,\\nand yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had\\nhappened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business\\nwas still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in\\nKensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the redheaded\\ncopier of the “Encyclopaedia” down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg\\nSquare, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What\\nwas this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we\\ngoing, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this\\nsmooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man— a man who\\nmight play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and\\nset the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.\\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way\\nacross the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms\\nwere standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of\\nvoices from above. On entering his room I found Holmes in animated\\nconversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the\\nofficial police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sadfaced man, with a\\nvery shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\\n“Ha! Our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and\\ntaking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I think you know Mr.\\nJones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is\\nto be our com\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 63\\npanion in to-night’s adventure.”\\n“We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,” said Jones\\nin his consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man\\nfor starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to\\ndo the running down.”\\n“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our\\nchase,” observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\\n“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes,\\nsir,” said the police agent loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are,\\nif he won’t mind my saying so, just a little too\\ntheoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective\\nin him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that\\nbusiness of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has\\nbeen more nearly correct than the official force.”\\n“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger\\nwith deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the\\nfirst Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have\\nnot had my rubber.”\\n“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you\\nwill play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done\\nyet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr.\\nMerryweather, the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for\\nyou, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your\\nhands.”\\n“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a\\nyoung man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I\\nwould rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London.\\nHe’s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal\\nduke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning\\nas his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never\\nknow where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one\\nweek, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.\\nI’ve been on his track for years\\nand have never set eyes on him yet.”\\n“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you tonight. I’ve had\\none or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay,\\nand I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It\\nis past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two\\nwill take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the\\nsecond.”\\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the\\nlong drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which\\nhe had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless\\nlabyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington\\nStreet.\\n“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather\\nis a bank director, and personally interested\\nin the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also.\\nHe is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He\\nhas one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog\\nand as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 65\\nHere we are, and they are waiting for us.”\\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\\nourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the\\nguidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and\\nthrough a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small\\ncorridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened,\\nand led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another\\nformidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then\\nconducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a\\nthird door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates\\nand massive boxes.\\n“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked as he held up\\nthe lantern and gazed about him.\\n“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags\\nwhich lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he remarked,\\nlooking up in surprise.\\n“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes severely. “You\\nhave already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg\\nthat you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and\\nnot to interfere?”\\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\\ninjured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the\\nfloor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine\\nminutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy\\nhim, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\\n“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they can hardly take\\nany steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose\\na minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have\\nfor their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no doubt you have divined\\n—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr.\\nMerryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that\\nthere are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a\\nconsiderable interest in this cellar at present.”\\n“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several\\nwarnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\\n“Your French gold?”\\n“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\\nborrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has\\nbecome known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and\\nthat it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000\\nnapoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is\\nmuch larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the\\ndirectors have had misgivings upon the subject.”\\n“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time\\nthat we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will\\ncome to a head. In the meantime\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 67\\nMr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.”\\n“And sit in the dark?”\\n“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought\\nthat, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your rubber after all. But I\\nsee that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the\\npresence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These\\nare daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may\\ndo us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and\\ndo you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon\\nthem, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about\\nshooting them down.”\\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\\nwhich I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and\\nleft us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never before\\nexperienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was\\nstill there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To me, with my nerves\\nworked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and\\nsubduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\\n“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through the\\nhouse into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked\\nyou, Jones?”\\n“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”\\n“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.”\\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour\\nand a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone\\nand the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I\\nfeared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest\\npitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the\\ngentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper,\\nheavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank\\ndirector. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the\\nfloor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened\\nout until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a\\ngash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand,\\nwhich felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more\\nthe hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was\\nwithdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the\\nsingle lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing\\nsound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a\\nsquare, gaping hole, through which\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 69\\nstreamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,\\nboyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either\\nside of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one\\nknee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole\\nand was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a\\npale face and a shock of very red hair.\\n“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags? Great\\nScott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”\\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The\\nother dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones\\nclutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but\\nHolmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and the pistol clinked\\nupon the stone floor.\\n“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You have no chance at all.”\\n“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that my\\npal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”\\n“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.\\n“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must\\ncompliment you.”\\n“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and\\neffective.”\\n“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at climbing\\ndown holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”\\n“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our\\nprisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not be aware\\nthat I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you\\naddress me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”\\n“All right,” said Jones with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you please,\\nsir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the\\npolice-station?”\\n“That is better,” said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the\\nthree of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\\n“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from\\nthe cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There\\nis no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete\\nmanner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever\\ncome within my experience.”\\n“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John\\nClay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this matter,\\nwhich I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid\\nby having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing\\nthe very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 71\\n“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat\\nover a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was perfectly obvious\\nfrom the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of\\nthe advertisement of the League, and the copying of the ‘Encyclopaedia,’\\nmust be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number\\nof hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would\\nbe difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to\\nClay’s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice’s hair. The 4 pounds\\na week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were\\nplaying for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the\\ntemporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and\\ntogether they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week.\\nFrom the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it\\nwas obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the\\nsituation.”\\n“But how could you guess what the motive was?” “Had there been women\\nin the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however,\\nwas out of the question. The man’s business was a small one, and there was\\nnothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations,\\nand such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of\\nthe house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for\\nphotography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There\\nwas the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious\\nassistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most\\ndaring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar—\\nsomething which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it\\nbe, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to\\nsome other building.\\n“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you\\nby beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the\\ncellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the\\nbell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some\\nskirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly\\nlooked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself\\nhave remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of\\nthose hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were\\nburrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank\\nabutted on our friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem.\\nWhen you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and\\nupon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”\\n“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” I\\nasked.\\n“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 73\\nsign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other\\nwords, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they\\nshould use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be\\nremoved. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would\\ngive them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them\\nto come to-night.”\\n“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. “It\\nis so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”\\n“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I already feel it\\nclosing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the\\ncommonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.”\\n“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,”\\nhe remarked. “‘L’homme c’est rien—l’oeuvre c’est tout,’ as Gustave\\nFlaubert wrote to George Sand.”\\nAdventure 3.\\nA Case of Identity.\\n“My dear fellow,” said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire\\nin his lodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely stranger than anything\\nwhich the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the\\nthings which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly\\nout of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove\\nthe roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange\\ncoincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of\\nevents, working through generations, and leading to the most outré results,\\nit would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions\\nmost stale and unprofitable.”\\n“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The cases\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 75\\nwhich come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar\\nenough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits,\\nand yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.”\\n“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic\\neffect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police report, where more\\nstress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the\\ndetails, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter.\\nDepend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.”\\nI smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand your thinking so.” I\\nsaid. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to\\neverybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are\\nbrought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here”—I picked\\nup the morning paper from the ground—”let us put it to a practical test.\\nHere is the first heading upon which I come. ‘A husband’s cruelty to his\\nwife.’ There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is\\nall perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink,\\nthe push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The\\ncrudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.”\\n“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,” said\\nHolmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This is the Dundas\\nseparation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small\\npoints in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no\\nother woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into\\nthe habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling\\nthem at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to\\nthe imagination of the average storyteller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor,\\nand acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.”\\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of\\nthe lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple\\nlife that I could not help commenting upon it.\\n“Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little\\nsouvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case\\nof the Irene Adler papers.”\\n“And the ring?” I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled\\nupon his finger.\\n“It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I\\nserved them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who\\nhave been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.”\\n“And have you any on hand just now?” I asked with interest.\\n“Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They\\nare important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have\\nfound that it is usually in unimpor\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 77\\ntant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick\\nanalysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The\\nlarger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more\\nobvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate\\nmatter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing\\nwhich presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may\\nhave something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of\\nmy clients, or I am much mistaken.”\\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds\\ngazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his\\nshoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman\\nwith a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a\\nbroadbrimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire\\nfashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a\\nnervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated\\nbackward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons.\\nSuddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she\\nhurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\\n“I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his cigarette\\ninto the fire. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de\\ncoeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too\\ndelicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When\\na woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and\\nthe usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a\\nlove matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or\\ngrieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.”\\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to\\nannounce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his\\nsmall black figure like a fullsailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat.\\nSherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was\\nremarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he\\nlooked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar\\nto him.\\n“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little trying to\\ndo so much typewriting?”\\n“I did at first,” she answered, “but now I know where the letters are without\\nlooking.” Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a\\nviolent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad,\\ngood-humoured face. “You’ve heard about me, Mr. Holmes,” she cried,\\n“else how could you know all that?”\\n“Never mind,” said Holmes, laughing; “it is my business to know things.\\nPerhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why\\nshould you come to consult me?”\\n“I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose\\nhusband you found so easy when the police\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 79\\nand everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you\\nwould do as much for me. I’m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in\\nmy own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would\\ngive it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\n“Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked Sherlock\\nHolmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary\\nSutherland. “Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said, “for it made me\\nangry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank—that is, my father—\\ntook it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and\\nso at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm\\ndone, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to\\nyou.”\\n“Your father,” said Holmes, “your stepfather, surely, since the name is\\ndifferent.”\\n“Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is\\nonly five years and two months older than myself.”\\n“And your mother is alive?”\\n“Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when\\nshe married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was nearly\\nfifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham\\nCourt Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried\\non with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made\\nher sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.\\nThey got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn’t near as\\nmuch as father could have got if he had been alive.”\\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and\\ninconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the\\ngreatest concentration of attention.\\n“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”\\n“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in\\nAuckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per cent. Two thousand\\nfive hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.”\\n“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw so large a\\nsum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt\\ntravel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady\\ncan get on very nicely upon an income of about 60 pounds.”\\n“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that\\nas long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and so they\\nhave the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that\\nis only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 81\\npays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn\\nat typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from\\nfifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”\\n“You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes. “This is my\\nfriend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself.\\nKindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at the\\nfringe of her jacket. “I met him first at the gasfitters’ ball,” she said. “They\\nused to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they\\nremembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to\\ngo. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I\\nwanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on\\ngoing, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk\\nwere not fit for us to know, when all father’s friends were to be there. And\\nhe said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had\\nnever so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would\\ndo, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went,\\nmother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there\\nI met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\n“I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back from\\nFrance he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”\\n“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and\\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a\\nwoman, for she would have her way.”\\n“I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman\\ncalled Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\n“Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got\\nhome all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met\\nhim twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer\\nAngel could not come to the house any more.”\\n“No?”\\n“Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort. He wouldn’t have\\nany visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be\\nhappy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a\\nwoman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.”\\n“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?”\\n“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote\\nand said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had\\ngone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I\\ntook the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.”\\n“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”\\n“Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took.\\nHosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 83\\nin Leadenhall Street—and—”\\n“What office?”\\n“That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t know.” “Where did he live,\\nthen?”\\n“He slept on the premises.”\\n“And you don’t know his address?”\\n“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”\\n“Where did you address your letters, then?”\\n“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called\\nfor. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all\\nthe other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite\\nthem, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said that when I\\nwrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten\\nhe always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show\\nyou how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would\\nthink of.”\\n“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an axiom of mine\\nthat the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember\\nany other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\\n“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the\\nevening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous.\\nVery retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He’d had\\nthe quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had\\nleft him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech.\\nHe was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak,\\njust as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.”\\n“Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned\\nto France?”\\n“Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should\\nmarry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me\\nswear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would\\nalways be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear,\\nand that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the\\nfirst and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of\\nmarrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said\\nnever to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said\\nshe would make it all right with him. I didn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It\\nseemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older\\nthan me; but I didn’t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at\\nBordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came\\nback to me on the very morning of the wedding.”\\n“It missed him, then?”\\n“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”\\n“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged,\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 85\\nthen, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?”\\n“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near\\nKing’s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the\\nSt. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as\\nthere were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself\\ninto a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab\\nin the street. We got to the church first, and when the fourwheeler drove up\\nwe waited for him to step out, but he never\\ndid, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked\\nthere was no one there! The cabman said that he could not\\nimagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in\\nwith his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I\\nhave never seen or heard anything since then to throw any\\nlight upon what became of him.”\\n“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,”\\nsaid Holmes.\\n“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so.\\nWhy, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to\\nbe true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us,\\nI was always to remember\\nthat I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge\\nsooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning,\\nbut what has happened since gives a meaning to it.” “Most certainly it does.\\nYour own opinion is, then, that some\\nunforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?”\\n“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have\\ntalked so. And then I think that what he fore\\nsaw happened.”\\n“But you have no notion as to what it could have been?” “None.”\\n“One more question. How did your mother take the matter?”\\n“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the\\nmatter again.”\\n“And your father? Did you tell him?”\\n“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had\\nhappened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said,\\nwhat interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors\\nof the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed\\nmy money, or if he had married me and got my money settled\\non him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very\\nindependent about money and never would look at a shilling\\nof mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could\\nhe not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I\\ncan’t sleep a wink at night.” She pulled a little handkerchief\\nout of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.\\n“I shall glance into the case for you,” said Holmes, rising,\\n“and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result.\\nLet the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let\\nyour mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr.\\nHosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from\\nyour life.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 87\\n“Then you don’t think I’ll see him again?”\\n“I fear not.”\\n“Then what has happened to him?”\\n“You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an\\naccurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.”\\n“I advertised for him in last Saturday’s Chronicle,” said she. “Here is the\\nslip and here are four letters from him.”\\n“Thank you. And your address?”\\n“No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.”\\n“Mr. Angel’s address you never had, I understand. Where is your father’s\\nplace of business?”\\n“He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of\\nFenchurch Street.”\\n“Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the\\npapers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the\\nwhole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.”\\n“You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to\\nHosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.”\\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something\\nnoble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She\\nlaid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a\\npromise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed\\ntogether, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward\\nto the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe,\\nwhich was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his\\nchair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look\\nof infinite languor in his face.\\n“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I found her more\\ninteresting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one.\\nYou will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in ’77, and\\nthere was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea,\\nhowever, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the\\nmaiden herself was most instructive.”\\n“You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to\\nme,” I remarked.\\n“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and\\nso you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the\\nimportance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues\\nthat may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that\\nwoman’s appearance? Describe it.”\\n“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of\\na brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a\\nfringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than\\ncoffee colour,\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 89\\nwith a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish\\nand were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn’t observe.\\nShe had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly\\nwell-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”\\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\\n“‘Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have\\nreally done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of\\nimportance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for\\ncolour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself\\nupon details. My first glance is always at a woman’s sleeve. In a man it is\\nperhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this\\nwoman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for\\nshowing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the\\ntypewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined.The sewingmachine,\\nof the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm,\\nand on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across\\nthe broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the\\ndint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short\\nsight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.”\\n“It surprised me.”\\n“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on\\nglancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing\\nwere not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a\\nslightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only\\nin the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and\\nfifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has\\ncome away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great\\ndeduction to say that she came away in a hurry.”\\n“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my\\nfriend’s incisive reasoning.\\n“I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but\\nafter being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the\\nforefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were\\nstained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too\\ndeep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear\\nupon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go\\nback to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised\\ndescription of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\\nI held the little printed slip to the light.\\n“Missing,” it said, “on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named\\nHosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow\\ncomplexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black sidewhiskers\\nand moustache;\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 91\\ntinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in\\nblack frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and\\ngrey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots.\\nKnown to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody\\nbringing—”\\n“That will do,” said Holmes. “As to the letters,” he continued, glancing\\nover them, “they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr.\\nAngel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point,\\nhowever, which will no doubt strike you.”\\n“They are typewritten,” I remarked.\\n“Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little\\n‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no\\nsuperscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point\\nabout the signature is very suggestive —in fact, we may call it conclusive.”\\n“Of what?”\\n“My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the\\ncase?”\\n“I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his\\nsignature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.”\\n“No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should\\nsettle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady’s\\nstepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six\\no’clock tomorrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with\\nthe male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to\\nthose letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the\\ninterim.”\\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of\\nreasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have\\nsome solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he\\ntreated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once\\nonly had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the\\nIrene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the\\nSign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study\\nin Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not\\nunravel. I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the\\nconviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he\\nheld in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the\\ndisappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the\\ntime, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It\\nwas not until close upon six o’clock that I found myself free and was able to\\nspring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be\\ntoo late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock\\nHolmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 93\\ncurled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and\\ntest-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that\\nhe had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\\n“Well, have you solved it?” I asked as I entered. “Yes. It was the bisulphate\\nof baryta.”\\n“No, no, the mystery!” I cried.\\n“Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working\\nupon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said\\nyesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that\\nthere is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.”\\n“Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?”\\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened\\nhis lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at\\nthe door.\\n“This is the girl’s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “He has\\nwritten to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!”\\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years\\nof age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner,\\nand a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a\\nquestioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the\\nsideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\\n“Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “I think that this\\ntypewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me\\nfor six o’clock?”\\n“Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own\\nmaster, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about\\nthis little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in\\npublic. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very\\nexcitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily\\ncontrolled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not\\nmind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it\\nis not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides,\\nit is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer\\nAngel?”\\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes quietly; “I have every reason to believe that\\nI will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. “I am delighted\\nto hear it,” he said.\\n“It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a typewriter has really quite\\nas much individuality as a man’s handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no\\ntwo of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others,\\nand some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr.\\nWindibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net 95\\nof the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the ‘r.’ There are fourteen other\\ncharacteristics, but those are the more obvious.”\\n“We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt\\nit is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his\\nbright little eyes.\\n“And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.\\nWindibank,” Holmes continued. “I think of writing another little\\nmonograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It\\nis a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four\\nletters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all\\ntypewritten. In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and the ‘r’s’ tailless,\\nbut you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the\\nfourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.”\\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. “I cannot\\nwaste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,” he said. “If you can\\ncatch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.”\\n“Certainly,” said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. “I\\nlet you know, then, that I have caught him!”\\n“What! where?” shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and\\nglancing about him like a rat in a trap.\\n“Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,” said Holmes suavely. “There is no\\npossible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it\\nwas a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to\\nsolve so simple a question. That’s right! Sit down and let us talk it over.”\\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of\\nmoisture on his brow. “It—it’s not actionable,” he stammered.\\n“I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it\\nwas as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came\\nbefore me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will\\ncontradict me if I go wrong.”\\nThe man sat huddled up in h is chair, with his head sunk upon his breast,\\nlike one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of\\nthe mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began\\ntalking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\\n“The man married a woman very much older tha n himself for her money,”\\nsaid he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she\\nlived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and\\nthe loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to\\npreserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but\\naffectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with\\nher fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be\\nallowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course,\\nthe loss of a hundred a\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net97\\nyear, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious\\ncourse of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of\\npeople of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer\\nforever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced\\nher positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever\\nstepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to\\nhis heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised\\nhimself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a\\nmoustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an\\ninsinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short sight,\\nhe appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love\\nhimself.”\\n“It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “We never thought that she\\nwould have been so carried away.”\\n“Very likely not. However that ma y be, the young lady was very decidedly\\ncarried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in\\nFrance, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind.\\nShe was flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was\\nincreased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr.\\nAngel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as\\nfar as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings,\\nand an engagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from\\nturning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up\\nforever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The\\nthing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic\\nmanner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady’s\\nmind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to\\ncome. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence\\nalso the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very\\nmorning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so\\nbound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to\\ncome, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church\\ndoor he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently\\nvanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler\\nand out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!”\\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes h ad\\nbeen talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale\\nface.\\n“It m ay be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but if you are so very\\nsharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking\\nthe law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but\\nas long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for\\nassault and illegal constraint.”\\n“The law cannot, as you say, to uch you,” said Holmes,\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net99\\nunlocking and throwing open the door, “yet there never was a man who\\ndeserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he\\nought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing\\nup at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not part of my\\nduties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just\\ntreat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could\\ngrasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door\\nbanged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running\\nat the top of his speed down the road.\\n“There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said Holmes, laughing, as he threw\\nhimself down into his chair once more. “That fellow will rise from crime to\\ncrime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case\\nhas, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”\\n“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” I remarked.\\n“Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer A ngel\\nmust have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally\\nclear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we\\ncould see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never\\ntogether, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was\\nsuggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both\\nhinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all\\nconfirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of\\ncourse, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would\\nrecognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts,\\ntogether with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.”\\n“And how did you verify them?”\\n“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the\\nfirm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I\\neliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise—the\\nwhiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that\\nthey would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their\\ntravellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I\\nwrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would\\ncome here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same\\ntrivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from\\nWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description\\ntallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank. Voilà\\ntout!”\\n“And Miss Sutherland?”\\n“If I tell her she will no t believe me. You may remember the old Persian\\nsaying, ‘There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also\\nfor whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ There is as much sense in\\nHafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.”\\nAdventure 4.\\nThe Boscombe Valley Mystery.\\nWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid\\nbrought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:\\n“Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the\\nwest of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad\\nif you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the\\n11:15.”\\n“What do you say, dear?” said my wife, looking across at me. “Will you\\ngo?”\\n“I rea lly don’t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.”\\n“Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been lookin g a little\\npale lately. I think that the change would\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net101 do you good, and you are al ways so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes’\\ncases.”\\n“I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of\\nthem,” I answered. “But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only\\nhalf an hour.”\\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of\\nmaking me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so\\nthat in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away\\nto Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the\\nplatform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey\\ntravelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\\n“It is really very good of you to come, Watson,” said he. “It makes a\\nconsiderable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can\\nthoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you\\nwill keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.”\\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which\\nHolmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with\\nintervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading.\\nThen he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up\\nonto the rack.\\n“Have you heard anything of the case?” he asked. “Not a word. I have not\\nseen a paper for some days.” “The London press has not had very full\\naccounts. I have\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net103\\njust been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the\\nparticulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases\\nwhich are so extremely difficult.”\\n“That sounds a little paradoxical.”\\n“But it is profoundly true. Singula rity is almost invariably a clue. The more\\nfeatureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it\\nhome. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case\\nagainst the son of the murdered man.”\\n“It is a murder, then?”\\n“Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have\\nthe opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of\\nthings to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few\\nwords.\\n“Bosco mbe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\\nHerefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John\\nTurner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to\\nthe old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let\\nto Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian.The men had\\nknown each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when\\nthey came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible.\\nTurner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but\\nstill remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were\\nfrequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner\\nhad an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living.\\nThey appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English\\nfamilies and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond\\nof sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the\\nneighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a man and a girl. Turner had\\na considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I\\nhave been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.\\n“On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his hous e at Hatherley\\nabout three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which\\nis a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down\\nthe Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning\\nat Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an\\nappointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he\\nnever came back alive.\\n“From Hatherley Farm -house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,\\nand two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old\\nwoman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder,\\na game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose\\nthat Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a\\nfew minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr.\\nJames McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best\\nof his belief, the father was\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net105\\nactually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no\\nmore of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had\\noccurred.\\n“The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the\\ngame-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded\\nround, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of\\nfourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the\\nBoscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She\\nstates that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close\\nby the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having\\na violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong\\nlanguage to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike\\nhis father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and\\ntold her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys\\nquarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were\\ngoing to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy\\ncame running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the\\nwood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited,\\nwithout either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were\\nobserved to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the\\ndead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been\\nbeaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries\\nwere such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his\\nson’s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the\\nbody. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and\\na verdict of ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday,\\nhe was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have\\nreferred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as\\nthey came out before the coroner and the police-court.”\\n“I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked. “If ever\\ncircumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.”\\n“Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered Holmes\\nthoughtfully. “It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you\\nshift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally\\nuncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be\\nconfessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the\\nyoung man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are\\nseveral people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss\\nTurner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his\\ninnocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in\\nconnection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest.\\nLestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is\\nthat two middleaged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour\\ninstead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net107\\n“I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious that you will find little\\ncredit to be gained out of this case.”\\n“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he answered,\\nlaughing. “Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts\\nwhich may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me\\ntoo well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or\\ndestroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or\\neven of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly\\nperceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and\\nyet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident\\na thing as that.”\\n“How on earth— ”\\n“My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which\\ncharacterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave\\nby the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get\\nfarther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get\\nround the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less\\nilluminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking\\nat himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only\\nquote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my\\nmétier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the\\ninvestigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which\\nwere brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.” “What\\nare they?”\\n“It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to\\nHatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he\\nwas a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it\\nwas no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect\\nof removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of\\nthe coroner’s jury.”\\n“It was a confession ,” I ejaculated.\\n“No, for it was followed by a prote station of innocence.”\\n“Coming on the top of such a damning series of event s, it was at least a\\nmost suspicious remark.”\\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes,“it is the brightest rift which I can at present\\nsee in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an\\nabsolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black\\nagainst him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned\\nindignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because\\nsuch surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and\\nyet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank\\nacceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a\\nman of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his\\ndeserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the\\ndead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day\\nso far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net109\\nhim, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to\\nraise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are\\ndisplayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind\\nrather than of a guilty one.”\\nI shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,” I\\nremarked.\\n“So they h ave. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”\\n“What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”\\n“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his support ers, though there are\\none or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may\\nread it for yourself.”\\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and\\nhaving turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the\\nunfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I\\nsettled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully.\\nIt ran in this way:\\n“Mr. James McC arthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and\\ngave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at\\nBristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the\\n3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was\\ninformed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the\\ngroom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard,\\nand, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of\\nthe yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then\\ntook my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with\\nthe intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On\\nmy way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his\\nevidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I\\nhad no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from\\nthe pool I heard a cry of “Cooee!” which was a usual signal between my\\nfather and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the\\npool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather\\nroughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high\\nwords and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent\\ntemper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and\\nreturned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,\\nhowever, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run\\nback again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head\\nterribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost\\ninstantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my\\nway to Mr. Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for\\nassistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea\\nhow he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat\\ncold and forbidding in his man\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net111 ners, but he had, as far as I kn ow, no active enemies. I know nothing further\\nof the matter.’\\n“The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\\n“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to\\na rat.\\n“The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\\n“Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thoug ht that he was delirious.\\n“The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had t his\\nfinal quarrel?\\n“Witness: I sh ould prefer not to answer.\\n“The Coroner: I am afraid that I must pr ess it.\\n“Witness: It is really impossible for me to tel l you. I can assure you that it\\nhas nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\\n“The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you\\nthat your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any\\nfuture proceedings which may arise.\\n“Witness: I must still refuse.\\n“The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was a common signal\\nbetween you and your father?\\n“Witness: It was.\\n“The Coroner: H ow was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and\\nbefore he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\\n“Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know . “A Juryman: Did\\nyou see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on\\nhearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\\n“Witness: Nothing definite.\\n“The Coroner: What do you mean?\\n“Witness: I was so disturbed and ex cited as I rushed out into the open, that I\\ncould think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression\\nthat as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It\\nseemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid\\nperhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.\\n“‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’\\n“‘Yes, it was gone.’\\n“‘You cannot say w hat it was?’\\n“‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’\\n“‘How far from the body?’\\n“‘A dozen yards or so.’\\n“‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’\\n“‘About the same.’\\n“‘Then if it was rem oved it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?’\\n“‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’\\n“This concluded the examination of the witness.”\\n“I see,” said I as I glanced down the column, “tha t the coro\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net113\\nner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He\\ncalls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having\\nsignalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his\\nconversation with his father, and his singular account of his father’s dying\\nwords. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.”\\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the\\ncushioned seat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,” said\\nhe, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s favour. Don’t\\nyou see that you alternately give him credit for having too much\\nimagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of\\nquarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he\\nevolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying\\nreference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall\\napproach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is\\ntrue, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is\\nmy pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we\\nare on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be\\nthere in twenty minutes.”\\nIt was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the\\nbeautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found\\nourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man,\\nfurtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the\\nlight brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his\\nrustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland\\nYard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already\\nbeen engaged for us.\\n“I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. “I\\nknew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had\\nbeen on the scene of the crime.”\\n“It was very nice and complimentary of you,” Holmes answered. “It is\\nentirely a question of barometric pressure.”\\nLestrade looked startled. “I do not quite foll ow,” he said.\\n“How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky.\\nI have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very\\nmuch superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it\\nis probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.”\\nLestrade laughed indulgently. “You have, no d oubt, already formed your\\nconclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “The case is as plain as a\\npikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of\\ncourse, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has\\nheard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her\\nthat there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done.\\nWhy, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”\\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most\\nlovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes\\nshining, her lips parted, a pink flush\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net115 upon her cheeks, all thought o f her natural reserve lost in her overpowering\\nexcitement and concern.\\n“Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the other of us,\\nand finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion,\\n“I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know\\nthat James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work\\nknowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known\\neach other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else\\ndoes; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to\\nanyone who really knows him.”\\n“I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock\\nHolmes. “You may rely upon my doing all that I can.” “But you have read\\nthe evidence. You have formed some\\nconclusion? Do you not see some loo phole, some flaw? Do\\nyou not yourself think that he is innocent?”\\n“I think that it is very probable.”\\n“There, now!” she cried, throwi ng back her head and looking defiantly at\\nLestrade. “You hear! He gives me hopes.” Lestrade shrugged his shoulders.\\n“I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his\\nconclusions,” he\\nsaid.\\n“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never\\ndid it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure tha t the\\nreason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was\\nbecause I was concerned in it.”\\n“In what way?” asked Holmes.\\n“It is no time for me to hide any thing. James and his father\\nhad many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very\\nanxious that there should be a marriage between us. James a nd\\nI have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of\\ncourse he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and—\\nand—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that\\nyet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of\\nthem.”\\n“And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favour of such\\na union?”\\n“No, he w as averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy\\nwas in favour of it.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young\\nface as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at\\nher.\\n“Th ank you for this information,” said he. “May I see your\\nfather if I call to-morrow?”\\n“I am afraid the doctor won ’t allow it.”\\n“The doctor?”\\n“Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong\\nfor years back, but this has broken him down completely. He\\nhas taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck\\nand that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was\\nthe only man alive who had known dad in the old days in\\nVictoria.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net117\\n“Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”\\n“Yes, at the mines.”\\n“Quite so; at the gol d-mines, where, as I understand, Mr.\\nTurner made his money.”\\n“Yes, certainly.”\\n“Thank you, Mis s Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.”\\n“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to\\nthe prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know\\nhim to be innocent.”\\n“I will, Miss Turner.”\\n“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him.\\nGood-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.” She hurried from the\\nroom as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her\\ncarriage rattle off down the street.\\n“I am ashamed of you, Holmes, ” said Lestrade with dignity after a few\\nminutes’ silence. “Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to\\ndisappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.”\\n“I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy, ” said Holmes.\\n“Have you an order to see him in prison?”\\n“Yes, but only for you and me.”\\n“Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time\\nto take a train to Hereford and see him tonight?”\\n“Ample.”\\n“Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall\\nonly be away a couple of hours.”\\nI walked down to the station w ith them, and then wandered through the\\nstreets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the\\nsofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of\\nthe story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through\\nwhich we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually\\nfrom the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave\\nmyself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing\\nthat this unhappy young man’s story were absolutely true, then what hellish\\nthing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have\\noccurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment\\nwhen, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was\\nsomething terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the\\ninjuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called\\nfor the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the\\ninquest. In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of\\nthe left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been\\nshattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my\\nown head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That\\nwas to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net119\\nwas face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the\\nolder man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be\\nworth while to call Holmes’ attention to it. Then there was the peculiar\\ndying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A\\nman dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it\\nwas more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what\\ncould it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation.\\nAnd then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that\\nwere true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress,\\npresumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to\\nreturn and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his\\nback turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and\\nimprobabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s opinion,\\nand yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that I could not\\nlose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of\\nyoung McCarthy’s innocence.\\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for\\nLestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\\n“The glass still keeps very high,” he remar ked as he sat down. “It is of\\nimportance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground.\\nOn the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such\\nnice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey.\\nI have seen young McCarthy.”\\n“And what did you learn from him?”\\n“Nothing.”\\n“Could he t hrow no light?”\\n“None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done\\nit and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as\\npuzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though\\ncomely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.”\\n“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is inde ed a fact that he was\\naverse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.”\\n“Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in\\nlove with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before\\nhe really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school,\\nwhat does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and\\nmarry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you\\ncan imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing\\nwhat he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely\\nimpossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands\\nup into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to\\npropose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting\\nhimself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would\\nhave thrown him over utterly\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net121\\nhad he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the\\nlast three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark\\nthat point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the\\nbarmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to\\nbe hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that\\nshe has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really\\nno tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young\\nMcCarthy for all that he has suffered.”\\n“But if he is innocent, who has done it?”\\n“Ah! who? I would call your attention v ery particularly to two points. One\\nis that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and\\nthat the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he\\ndid not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man\\nwas heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had returned. Those\\nare the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk\\nabout George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters\\nuntil to-morrow.”\\nThere was no rai n, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright\\nand cloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and\\nwe set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\\n“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observe d. “It is said that Mr.\\nTurner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”\\n“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.\\n“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and\\nhe has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very\\nbad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s, and, I may add, a\\ngreat benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm\\nrent free.”\\n“Indeed! T hat is interesting,” said Holmes.\\n“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he ha s helped him. Everybody about\\nhere speaks of his kindness to him.”\\n“Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who\\nappears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such\\nobligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner’s\\ndaughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very\\ncocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else\\nwould follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself\\nwas averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce\\nsomething from that?”\\n“We have got to the de ductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade, winking\\nat me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away\\nafter theories and fancies.”\\n“You are right,” said Holm es demurely; “you do find it very hard to tackle\\nthe facts.”\\n“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net123\\ndifficult to get hold of,” replied Lestrade with some warmth. “And that is\\n—”\\n“Th at McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all\\ntheories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”\\n“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes, laughing. “But\\nI am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.”\\n“Yes, that is it.” It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, twostoried,\\nslate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey\\nwalls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a\\nstricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We\\ncalled at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’ request, showed us the boots\\nwhich her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son’s,\\nthough not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very\\ncarefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to\\nthe court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to\\nBoscombe Pool.\\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as\\nthis. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker\\nStreet would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened.\\nHis brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out\\nfrom beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his\\nshoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like\\nwhipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a\\npurely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely\\nconcentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell\\nunheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient\\nsnarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which\\nran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe\\nPool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were\\nmarks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which\\nbounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes\\nstop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade\\nand I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while\\nI watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that\\nevery one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.\\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty\\nyards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and\\nthe private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it\\nupon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked\\nthe site of the rich landowner’s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool\\nthe woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass\\ntwenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined\\nthe lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been\\nfound, and, indeed, so\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net125\\nmoist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left\\nby the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face\\nand peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled\\ngrass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned\\nupon my companion.\\n“What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\\n“I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other\\ntrace. But how on earth—”\\n“Oh, tut, tut! I have no tim e! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is\\nall over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the\\nreeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they\\ncame like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party\\nwith the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or\\neight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same\\nfeet.” He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better\\nview, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. “These are young\\nMcCarthy’s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the\\nsoles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his\\nstory. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the\\nfather’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end\\nof the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here?\\nTiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they\\ncome again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come\\nfrom?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track\\nuntil we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a\\ngreat beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to\\nthe farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little\\ncry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the\\nleaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an\\nenvelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark\\nof the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the\\nmoss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a\\npathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces\\nwere lost.\\n“It has be en a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning to his\\nnatural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge.\\nI think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a\\nlittle note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may\\nwalk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”\\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into\\nRoss, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in\\nthe wood.\\n“This may interest you, Lestrade,” he remarked, holding it out. “The murder\\nwas done with it.”\\n“I see no marks.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net127\\n“There are none.”\\n“How do you kno w, then?”\\n“The grass was growing un der it. It had only lain there a\\nfew days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It\\ncorresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.”\\n“And the murderer?”\\n“Is a tall man, left- handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled\\nshooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder,\\nand carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other\\nindications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.”\\nLestrade laughed. “I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,” he s aid. “Theories\\nare all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.”\\n“Nous verrons,” answered Holmes calmly. “You work your own me thod,\\nand I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably\\nreturn to London by the evening train.”\\n“And leave your case unfinished?”\\n“No, finished.”\\n“But the myster y?”\\n“It is solved.”\\n“Who was the criminal, then?”\\n“The gentleman I describe.”\\n“But who is he?”\\n“Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous\\nneighbourhood.”\\nLestrade shrugge d his shoulders. “I am a practical man,” he said, “and I\\nreally cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed\\ngentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland\\nYard.”\\n“All ri ght,” said Holmes quietly. “I have given you the chance. Here are\\nyour lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.”\\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, wher e we found\\nlunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained\\nexpression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.\\n“Look here, Watson,” he said when the cloth was cleared “just sit down in\\nthis chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don’t know quite what to\\ndo, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expound.”\\n“Pray do so.”\\n“Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young\\nMcCarthy’s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they\\nimpressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his\\nfather should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing him.\\nThe other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several\\nwords, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s ear. Now from\\nthis double point our research must commence,\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net129\\nand we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.”\\n“What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?”\\n“Well, obviously it could not h ave been meant for the son. The son, as far as\\nhe knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The\\n‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had\\nthe appointment with. But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly Australian cry, and one\\nwhich is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the\\nperson whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was\\nsomeone who had been in Australia.”\\n“What of the rat, then?”\\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on\\nthe table. “This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,” he said. “I wired to\\nBristol for it last night.” He put his hand over part of the map. “What do\\nyou read?”\\n“ARAT,” I read.\\n“And now?” He raised his hand.\\n“BALLARAT.”\\n“Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only\\ncaught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his\\nmurderer. So and so, of Ballarat.”\\n“It is wonderful!” I exclaimed.\\n“It is obvious. And now, y ou see, I had narrowed the field down\\nconsiderably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which,\\ngranting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come\\nnow out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from\\nBallarat with a grey cloak.”\\n“Certainly.”\\n“And one w ho was at home in the district, for the pool can only be\\napproached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly\\nwander.”\\n“Quite so .”\\n“Then com es our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I\\ngained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the\\npersonality of the criminal.”\\n“But how did you gain them ?”\\n“You know my method. It is fo unded upon the observation of trifles.”\\n“His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his\\nstride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.”\\n“Yes, they were peculiar boots.”\\n“But his lameness?”\\n“The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He\\nput less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped—he was lame.”\\n“But his left-handedness.”\\n“You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the\\nsurgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and\\nyet was upon the left side. Now,\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net131\\nhow can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind\\nthat tree during the interview between the father and son. He had even\\nsmoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of\\ntobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you\\nknow, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the\\nashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having\\nfound the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the\\nmoss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are\\nrolled in Rotterdam.”\\n“And the cigar-holder?”\\n“I could see that the en d had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a\\nholder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean\\none, so I deduced a blunt penknife.”\\n“Holmes,” I said, “you have drawn a net round this man from which he\\ncannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you\\nhad cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all this\\npoints. The culprit is—”\\n“Mr. John Turner,” cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sittingroom,\\nand ushering in a visitor.\\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow,\\nlimping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and\\nyet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed\\nthat he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His\\ntangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined\\nto give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an\\nashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a\\nshade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some\\ndeadly and chronic disease.\\n“Pray sit down on the sofa,” said Holmes gently. “You had my note?”\\n“Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to s ee me\\nhere to avoid scandal.”\\n“I thought people woul d talk if I went to the Hall.” “And why did you wish\\nto see me?” He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary\\neyes, as though his question was already answered.\\n“Yes,” said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. “It is so. I\\nknow all about McCarthy.”\\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. “God help me!” he cried. “But I\\nwould not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I\\nwould have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.”\\n“I am glad to hear you say so,” said Holmes gravely. “I woul d have spoken\\nnow had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart—it will break\\nher heart when she hears that I am arrested.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net133\\n“It may not come to that,” said Holmes.\\n“What?”\\n“I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required\\nmy presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must\\nbe got off, however.”\\n“I am a dying man,” said old Turner. “I have had diabetes for years. My\\ndoctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather\\ndie under my own roof than in a gaol.”\\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle\\nof paper before him. “Just tell us the truth,” he said. “I shall jot down the\\nfacts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce\\nyour confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise\\nyou that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.”\\n“It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a question whether I shall live to the\\nAssizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the\\nshock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time\\nin the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\\n“You didn’t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell\\nyou that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has\\nbeen upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I’ll tell you\\nfirst how I came to be in his power.\\n“It was in the early ‘60’s at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hotblooded\\nand reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad\\ncompanions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush,\\nand in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber.\\nThere were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station\\nfrom time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.\\nBlack Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still\\nremembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\\n“One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we\\nlay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it\\nwas a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley.\\nThree of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my\\npistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I\\nwish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his\\nwicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature.\\nWe got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over\\nto England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and\\ndetermined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this\\nestate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little\\ngood with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I\\nmarried, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little\\nAlice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me\\ndown the\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net135\\nright path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf\\nand did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when\\nMcCarthy laid his grip upon me.\\n“I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street\\nwith hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\\n“‘Here we are, Jack,’ says he, touching me on the arm; ‘we’ll be as good as\\na family to you. There’s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the\\nkeeping of us. If you don’t—it’s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and\\nthere’s always a policeman within hail.’\\n“Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off,\\nand there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no\\nrest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his\\ncunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he\\nsoon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police.\\nWhatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without\\nquestion, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could\\nnot give. He asked for Alice.\\n“His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to\\nbe in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step\\ninto the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed\\nstock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood\\nwas in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I\\nbraved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between\\nour houses to talk it over.\\n“When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a\\ncigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to\\nhis talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He\\nwas urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she\\nmight think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to\\nthink that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a\\nman as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a\\ndesperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that\\nmy own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved\\nif I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it\\nagain. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for\\nit. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me\\nwas more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction\\nthan if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his\\nson; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back\\nto fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story,\\ngentlemen, of all that occurred.”\\n“Well, it is not for me to judge you,” said Holmes as the old man signed the\\nstatement which had been drawn out. “I pray\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net137\\nthat we may never be exposed to such a temptation.” “I pray not, sir. And\\nwhat do you intend to do?” “In view of your health, nothing. You are\\nyourself aware\\nthat you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the\\nAssizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall\\nbe forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your\\nsecret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.”\\n“Farewell, then,” said the old man solemnly. “Your own deathbeds, when\\nthey come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have\\ngiven to mine.” Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled\\nslowly from the room.\\n“God help us!” said Holmes after a long silence. “Why does fate play such\\ntricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I\\ndo not think of Baxter’s words, and say, ‘There, but for the grace of God,\\ngoes Sherlock Holmes.’”\\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number\\nof objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the\\ndefending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview,\\nbut he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter\\nmay come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which\\nrests upon their past.\\nAdventure 5.\\nThe Five Orange Pips\\nWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases\\nbetween the years ’82 and ’90, I am faced by so many which present\\nstrange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to\\nchoose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity\\nthrough the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar\\nqualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the\\nobject of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical\\nskill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while\\nothers have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations\\nfounded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical\\nproof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net139\\nwhich was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am\\ntempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in\\nconnection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,\\nentirely cleared up.\\nThe year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less\\ninterest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one\\ntwelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber,\\nof the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower\\nvault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the\\nBritish barque “Sophy Anderson”, of the singular adventures of the Grice\\nPatersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning\\ncase. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by\\nwinding up the dead man’s watch, to prove that it had been wound up two\\nhours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that\\ntime—a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the\\ncase. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them\\npresent such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I\\nhave now taken up my pen to describe.\\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in\\nwith exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had\\nbeaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, handmade\\nLondon we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the\\nroutine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces\\nwhich shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed\\nbeasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and\\nthe wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat\\nmoodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime,\\nwhile I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories until\\nthe howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the\\nsplash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My\\nwife was on a visit to her mother’s, and for a few days I was a dweller once\\nmore in my old quarters at Baker Street.\\n“Why,” said I, glancing up at my companion, “that was surely the bell. Who\\ncould come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?”\\n“Except yourself I have none,” he answered. “I do not encourage visitors.”\\n“A client, then?”\\n“If so, it is a serio us case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day\\nand at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of\\nthe landlady’s.”\\nSherlock Holme s was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a\\nstep in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm\\nto turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon\\nwhich a newcomer must sit.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net141 “Come in!” said he.\\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside,\\nwell-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy\\nin his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his\\nlong shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had\\ncome. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could\\nsee that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is\\nweighed down with some great anxiety.\\n“I owe you an apology,” he said, raising his golden pincenez to his eyes. “I\\ntrust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the\\nstorm and rain into your snug chamber.”\\n“Give me your coat and umbrella,” said Holmes. “They may rest here on\\nthe hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the south-west,\\nI see.”\\n“Yes, from Horsham.”\\n“That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite\\ndistinctive.”\\n“I have com e for advice.”\\n“That is easily got.”\\n“And help.”\\n“That is not always so easy.”\\n“I have heard of you, Mr. Ho lmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you\\nsaved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.”\\n“Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.”\\n“He said that you could solve anything.”\\n“He said too much.”\\n“That you are never beaten.”\\n“I have been beaten four times—three times by men, and once by a\\nwoman.”\\n“But wha t is that compared with the number of your successes?”\\n“It is true that I have been generally successful.”\\n“Then you may be so with me.”\\n“I beg that you will draw your c hair up to the fire and favour me with some\\ndetails as to your case.”\\n“It is no ordinary one.”\\n“None of those which c ome to me are. I am the last court of appeal.”\\n“And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you hav e ever\\nlistened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those\\nwhich have happened in my own family.”\\n“You fill me with interest,” said Holmes . “Pray give us the essential facts\\nfrom the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those\\ndetails which seem to me to be most important.”\\nThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed h is wet feet out towards the\\nblaze.\\n“My n ame,” said he, “is John Openshaw, but my own af\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net143\\nfairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It\\nis a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go\\nback to the commencement of the affair.\\n“You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle Elias and my\\nfather Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged\\nat the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the\\nOpenshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he\\nwas able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.\\n“My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and\\nbecame a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well.\\nAt the time of the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and afterwards under\\nHood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my\\nuncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years.\\nAbout 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in\\nSussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the\\nStates, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and\\nhis dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He\\nwas a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he\\nwas angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he\\nlived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden\\nand two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his\\nexercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his\\nroom. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he\\nwould see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own\\nbrother.\\n“He didn’t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he\\nsaw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year\\n1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my\\nfather to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When\\nhe was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with\\nme, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and\\nwith the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite\\nmaster of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do\\nwhat I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one\\nsingular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up\\namong the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never\\npermit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy’s curiosity I have\\npeeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a\\ncollection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.\\n“One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon\\nthe table in front of the colonel’s plate. It was not a common thing for him\\nto receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no\\nfriends of any sort. ‘From India!’ said he as he took it up, ‘Pondicherry\\npostmark!\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net145\\nWhat can this be?’ Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried\\norange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this,\\nbut the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had\\nfallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared\\nat the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’ he\\nshrieked, and then, ‘My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!’\\n“‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried.\\n“‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving\\nme palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red\\nink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times\\nrepeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the\\nreason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I\\nascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which\\nmust have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a\\ncashbox, in the other.\\n“‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them still,’ said he with\\nan oath. ‘Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send\\ndown to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’\\n“I did as he ordered, and when the lawye r arrived I was asked to step up to\\nthe room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass\\nof black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open\\nand empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon\\nthe lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the\\nenvelope.\\n“‘I wish y ou, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness my will. I leave my estate,\\nwith all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father,\\nwhence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well\\nand good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to\\nyour deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I\\ncan’t say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where\\nMr. Fordham shows you.’\\n“I signed the paper as dire cted, and the lawyer took it away with him. The\\nsingular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me,\\nand I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being\\nable to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of\\ndread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks\\npassed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I\\ncould see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he\\nwas less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in\\nhis room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would\\nemerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and\\ntear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was\\nafraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen,\\nby man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush\\ntumultuously in at\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net147\\nthe door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out\\nno longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times\\nI have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it\\nwere new raised from a basin.\\n“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your\\npatience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies\\nfrom which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for\\nhim, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of\\nthe garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two\\nfeet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought\\nin a verdict of ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew how he winced from the very\\nthought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of\\nhis way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into\\npossession of the estate, and of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit\\nat the bank.”\\n“One moment,” Holmes interposed, “your statement is, I foresee, one of the\\nmost remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the\\nreception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.”\\n“The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,\\nupon the night of May 2nd.”\\n“Thank you. Pray proceed.”\\n“When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made\\na careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We\\nfound the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the\\ninside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated\\nupon it, and ‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’ written beneath.\\nThese, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been\\ndestroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much\\nimportance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books\\nbearing upon my uncle’s life in America. Some of them were of the war\\ntime and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of\\na brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the\\nSouthern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had\\nevidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had\\nbeen sent down from the North.\\n“Well, it was the beginning of ’8 4 when my father came to live at Horsham,\\nand all went as well as possible with us until the January of ’85. On the\\nfourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise\\nas we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly\\nopened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched\\npalm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cockand-\\nbull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now\\nthat the same thing had come upon himself.\\n“‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John? ’ he stammered.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net149 “My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’ said I.\\n“He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried. ‘Here are the very\\nletters. But what is this written above them?’\\n“‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peepi ng over his shoulder.\\n“‘What papers? What sundial?’ he asked.\\n“‘The sundial in the garden. There is no other,’ said I; ‘but the papers must\\nbe those that are destroyed.’\\n“‘Pooh!’ said he, gripping h ard at his courage. ‘We are in a civilised land\\nhere, and we can’t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come\\nfrom?’\\n“‘From Dundee,’ I answered, glancing at the postmark.\\n“‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he. ‘What have I to do with\\nsundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.’\\n“‘I should certainly speak to the police,’ I said.\\n“‘And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of t he sort.’\\n“‘Then let me do so?’\\n“‘No, I forbid you. I w on’t have a fuss made about such nonsense.’\\n“It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate ma n. I went\\nabout, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\\n“On the third day after the coming of the letter my father w ent from home\\nto visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of\\nthe forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to\\nme that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that,\\nhowever, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a\\ntelegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had\\nfallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood,\\nand was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he\\npassed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it\\nappears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country\\nwas unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation\\nin bringing in a verdict of ‘death from accidental causes.’ Carefully as I\\nexamined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything\\nwhich could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no\\nfootmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the\\nroads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and\\nthat I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\\n“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did\\nnot dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles\\nwere in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s life, and that\\nthe danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.\\n“It was in January, ’85, that my poor father met his end, an d two years and\\neight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily\\nat Horsham, and I had begun to\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net151\\nhope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended\\nwith the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however;\\nyesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come\\nupon my father.”\\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning\\nto the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\\n“This is the envelope,” he continued. “The postmark is London—eastern\\ndivision. Within are the very words which were upon my father’s last\\nmessage: ‘K. K. K.’; and then ‘Put the papers on the sundial.’”\\n“What have you done?” asked Holmes.\\n“Nothing.”\\n“Nothing?”\\n“To tell the truth”—he sank his face into his thin, white\\nhands—”I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when\\nthe snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless,\\ninexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.”\\n“Tut! tut!” cried Sherlock Holmes. “You must act, man, or you are lost.\\nNothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.”\\n“I have seen the police.”\\n“Ah!”\\n“But th ey listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced\\nthat the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical\\njokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury\\nstated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.”\\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. “Incredible imbecility!” he\\ncried.\\n“They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the\\nhouse with me.”\\n“Has he come w ith you to-night?”\\n“No. His orders were to stay in the house.”\\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\\n“Why did you come to me,” he cried, “and, above all, why did you not\\ncome at once?”\\n“I did not know . It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about\\nmy troubles and was advised by him to come to you.”\\n“It is really two days since you had the letter. We sho uld have acted before\\nthis. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have\\nplaced before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?”\\n“There is one thing,” said John Openshaw. He rummaged in hi s coat pocket,\\nand, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out\\nupon the table. “I have some remembrance,” said he, “that on the day when\\nmy uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins\\nwhich lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single\\nsheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net153\\nthink that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from\\namong the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the\\nmention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a\\npage from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.”\\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which\\nshowed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was\\nheaded, “March, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical\\nnotices:\\n“4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\\n“7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramo re, and John\\nSwain, of St. Augustine.\\n“9th. McCauley cleared.\\n“10th. John Swain cleare d.\\n“12th. Visited Paramore. A ll well.”\\n“Thank you!” said Holmes, foldin g up the paper and returning it to our\\nvisitor. “And now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot\\nspare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home\\ninstantly and act.”\\n“What shall I do?”\\n“There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this\\npiece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have\\ndescribed. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were\\nburned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must\\nassert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done\\nthis, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you\\nunderstand?”\\n“Entirely.”\\n“Do not thi nk of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we\\nmay gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while\\ntheirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing\\ndanger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to\\npunish the guilty parties.”\\n“I thank you,” said the yo ung man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. “You\\nhave given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise.”\\n“Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the\\nmeanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are\\nthreatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?”\\n“By train from Waterloo.”\\n“It is not yet nine. The stre ets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in\\nsafety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.”\\n“I am armed.”\\n“That is well. T o-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.”\\n“I shall see you at Horsham, then?”\\n“No, your secret lies in London. It i s there that I shall seek it.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net155\\n“Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box\\nand the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.” He shook hands\\nwith us and took his leave. Outside the wind still screamed and the rain\\nsplashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed\\nto have come to us from amid the mad elements—blown in upon us like a\\nsheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now to have been reabsorbed by them\\nonce more.\\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward\\nand his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and\\nleaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased\\neach other up to the ceiling.\\n“I think, Watson,” he remarked at last, “that of all our cases we have had\\nnone more fantastic than this.”\\n“Save, perhaps, the Sign of Fou r.”\\n“Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. An d yet this John Openshaw seems to me to\\nbe walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.”\\n“But have you,” I asked, “formed any definite conception as to what these\\nperils are?”\\n“There can be no question as to their nature,” he answered.\\n“Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why doe s he pursue this\\nunhappy family?”\\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of\\nhis chair, with his finger-tips together. “The ideal reasoner,” he remarked,\\n“would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings,\\ndeduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all\\nthe results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a\\nwhole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who\\nhas thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to\\naccurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet\\ngrasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be\\nsolved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution\\nby the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is\\nnecessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have\\ncome to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a\\npossession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education\\nand encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so\\nimpossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is\\nlikely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my\\ncase to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of\\nour friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.”\\n“Yes,” I answered, laughing. “It was a singular docume nt. Philosophy,\\nastronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable,\\ngeology profound as regards the mudstains from any region within fifty\\nmiles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational\\nliterature and\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net157\\ncrime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and selfpoisoner\\nby cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of\\nmy analysis.”\\nHolmes grinned at the last item. “Well,” he said, “I say now, as I said then,\\nthat a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture\\nthat he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of\\nhis library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the\\none which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all\\nour resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the ‘American\\nEncyclopaedia’ which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now\\nlet us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the\\nfirst place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw\\nhad some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do\\nnot change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of\\nFlorida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love\\nof solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or\\nsomething, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of\\nsomeone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was\\nhe feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters\\nwhich were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the\\npostmarks of those letters?”\\n“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third\\nfrom London.”\\n“From East L ondon. What do you deduce from that?” “They are all\\nseaports. That the writer was on board of a\\nship.”\\n“Exce llent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt\\nthat the probability—the strong probability—is that the wr iter\\nwas on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point .\\nIn the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the\\nthreat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or\\nfour days. Does that suggest anything?”\\n“A greater distance to travel.”\\n“But the letter had also a grea ter distance to come.” “Then I do not see the\\npoint.”\\n“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which\\nthe man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they a lways\\nsend their singular warning or token before them when start ing upon their\\nmission. You see how quickly the deed followed\\nthe sign when it came from Dundee. If they had c ome from\\nPondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as\\nsoon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elap sed.\\nI think that those seven weeks represented the difference betwee n the mailboat\\nwhich brought the letter and the sailing\\nvessel which brought the writer.”\\n“It is possible.”\\n“More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly\\nurgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to\\ncaution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net159\\nwhich it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes\\nfrom London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.”\\n“Good God!” I cried. “What can it mean, this relentless persecution?”\\n“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importa nce to\\nthe person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that\\nthere must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried\\nout two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s jury. There must\\nhave been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and\\ndetermination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it\\nmay. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual\\nand becomes the badge of a society.”\\n“But of what society?”\\n“Have you never—” s aid Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking\\nhis voice—”have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”\\n“I never have.”\\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. “Here it is,” said\\nhe presently:\\n“‘Ku Klux K lan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the\\nsound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed\\nby some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War,\\nand it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country,\\nnotably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its\\npower was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the\\nnegro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who\\nwere opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning\\nsent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape—a\\nsprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On\\nreceiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or\\nmight fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would\\nunfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen\\nmanner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its\\nmethods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded\\nin braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced\\nhome to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite\\nof the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of\\nthe community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement\\nrather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of\\nthe same sort since that date.’\\n“You will observe,” said Holm es, laying down the volume, “that the sudden\\nbreaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of\\nOpenshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause\\nand effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more\\nimplacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net161\\ndiary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may\\nbe many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.”\\n“Then the page we have seen—”\\n“Is such as we might expect. It ra n, if I remember right, ‘sent the pips to A,\\nB, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them. Then there are\\nsuccessive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that\\nC was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that\\nwe may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only\\nchance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him.\\nThere is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my\\nviolin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the\\nstill more miserable ways of our fellow-men.”\\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued\\nbrightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock\\nHolmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\\n“You will excuse me for not waiting for you,” said h e; “I have, I foresee, a\\nvery busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw’s.”\\n“What steps will you take?” I asked.\\n“It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may have\\nto go down to Horsham, after all.”\\n“You will not go there first?”\\n“No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will\\nbring up your coffee.”\\nAs I waited, I lifted th e unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my\\neye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.\\n“Holmes,” I cried, “you are too late.”\\n“Ah!” said he, laying down his cup, “I feared as much. How was it done?”\\nHe spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\\n“My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading ‘Tragedy Near\\nWaterloo Bridge.’ Here is the account:\\n“Between nine and ten last night Polic e-Constable Cook, of the H Division,\\non duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water.\\nThe night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the\\nhelp of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The\\nalarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body\\nwas eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose\\nname, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was\\nJohn Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured\\nthat he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo\\nStation, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path\\nand walked over the edge of one of the small landingplaces for river\\nsteamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no\\ndoubt that the deceased had been\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net163\\nthe victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of\\ncalling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside\\nlanding-stages.”\\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken\\nthan I had ever seen him.\\n“That hurts my pride, W atson,” he said at last. “It is a petty feeling, no\\ndoubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now,\\nand, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he\\nshould come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death\\n—!” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable\\nagitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and\\nunclasping of his long thin hands.\\n“They must be cunning devils,” h e exclaimed at last. “How could they have\\ndecoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the\\nstation. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for\\ntheir purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am\\ngoing out now!”\\n“To the police?”\\n“No; I shall be m y own police. When I have spun the web they may take the\\nflies, but not before.”\\nAll day I was engag ed in my professional work, and it was late in the\\nevening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come\\nback yet. It was nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale and\\nworn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he\\ndevoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.\\n“You are hungry,” I remarked.\\n“Starving. It had escaped my m emory. I have had nothing since breakfast.”\\n“Nothing?”\\n“Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.”\\n“And how have you succeeded?”\\n“Well.”\\n“You ha ve a clue?”\\n“I have them in th e hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long\\nremain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark\\nupon them. It is well thought of!”\\n“What do you mean?”\\nHe took an orange fro m the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed\\nout the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an\\nenvelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote “S. H. for J. O.” Then he sealed\\nit and addressed it to “Captain James Calhoun, Barque ‘Lone Star,’\\nSavannah, Georgia.”\\n“That will await him when he enters port,” said he, chuckling. “It may give\\nhim a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as\\nOpenshaw did before him.”\\n“And who is this Captain Ca lhoun?”\\n“The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net165 “How did you trace it, then?”\\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and\\nnames.\\n“I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over Lloyd’s registers and files of\\nthe old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at\\nPondicherry in January and February in ’83. There were thirty-six ships of\\nfair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one,\\nthe ‘Lone Star,’ instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was\\nreported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to\\none of the states of the Union.”\\n“Texas, I think.”\\n“I was not and a m not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an\\nAmerican origin.”\\n“What then?”\\n“I searched th e Dundee records, and when I found that the barque ‘Lone\\nStar’ was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. I then\\ninquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London.”\\n“Yes?”\\n“The ‘L one Star’ had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert\\nDock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this\\nmorning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned\\nthat she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no\\ndoubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of\\nWight.”\\n“What w ill you do, then?”\\n“Oh, I have my hand upo n him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the\\nonly native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans.\\nI know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it\\nfrom the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their\\nsailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and\\nthe cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three\\ngentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.”\\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the\\nmurderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which\\nwould show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves,\\nwas upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales\\nthat year. We waited long for news of the “Lone Star” of Savannah, but\\nnone ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the\\nAtlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of\\na wave, with the letters “L. S.” carved upon it, and that is all which we shall\\never know of the fate of the “Lone Star.”\\nAdventure 6.\\nThe Man with the Twisted Lip.\\nIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the\\nTheological College of St. George’s, was much addicted to opium. The\\nhabit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was\\nat college; for having read De Quincey’s description of his dreams and\\nsensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to\\nproduce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the\\npractice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he\\ncontinued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to\\nhis friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face,\\ndrooping lids, and pinpoint pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin\\nof a noble man.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net167\\nOne night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell, about the\\nhour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in\\nmy chair, and my wife laid her needlework down in her lap and made a\\nlittle face of disappointment.\\n“A patient!” said she. “You’ll have to go out.”\\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day. We heard the door\\nopen, a few hurried words, and then\\nquick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in\\nsome dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\\n“You will excuse my calling so late,” she began, and then, suddenly losing\\nher self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife’s neck, and\\nsobbed upon her shoulder. “Oh, I’m in such trouble!” she cried; “I do so\\nwant a little help.”\\n“Why,” said my wife, pulling up her veil, “it is Kate Whitney. How you\\nstartled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.”\\n“I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.” That was always the\\nway. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.\\n“It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and\\nwater, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather\\nthat I sent James off to bed?”\\n“Oh, no, no! I want the doctor’s advice and help, too. It’s about Isa. He has\\nnot been home for two days. I am so fright\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net169 ened about him!”\\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s trouble,\\nto me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We\\nsoothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know\\nwhere her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to\\nher?\\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when\\nthe fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City.\\nHitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come\\nback, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been\\nupon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the\\ndregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There\\nhe was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper\\nSwandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid\\nwoman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from\\namong the ruffians who surrounded him?\\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I\\nnot escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she\\ncome at all? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as such I had\\ninfluence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her\\non my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he\\nwere indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I\\nhad left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding\\neastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time,\\nthough the future only could show how strange it was to be.\\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper\\nSwandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line\\nthe north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slopshop\\nand a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a\\nblack gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in\\nsearch. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in\\nthe centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a\\nflickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into\\na long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and\\nterraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.\\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in\\nstrange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back,\\nand chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye\\nturned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little\\nred circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or\\nwaned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some\\nmuttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low,\\nmonotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly\\ntailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying\\nlittle heed to\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net171\\nthe words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of\\nburning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a\\ntall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows\\nupon his knees, staring into the fire.\\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me\\nand a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\\n“Thank you. I have not come to stay,” said I. “There is a friend of mine\\nhere, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.”\\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering\\nthrough the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out\\nat me.\\n“My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with\\nevery nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?”\\n“Nearly eleven.”\\n“Of what day?”\\n“Of Friday, June 19th.”\\n“Good heavens! I thoug ht it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d’you\\nwant to frighten a chap for?” He sank his face onto his arms and began to\\nsob in a high treble key.\\n“I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days\\nfor you. You should be ashamed of yourself!”\\n“So I am. But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few\\nhours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But I’ll go home with\\nyou. I wouldn’t frighten Kate— poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have\\nyou a cab?”\\n“Yes, I have one waiting.”\\n“Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson.\\nI am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.”\\nI walked down the narrow passage between th e double row of sleepers,\\nholding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and\\nlooking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the\\nbrazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, “Walk\\npast me, and then look back at me.” The words fell quite distinctly upon my\\near. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my\\nside, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent\\nwith age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though\\nit had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward\\nand looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking\\nout into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could\\nsee him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes\\nhad regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my\\nsurprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to\\nme to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the\\ncompany once more, subsided into a doddering,\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net173\\nloose-lipped senility.\\n“Holmes!” I whisper ed, “what on earth are you doing in\\nthis den?”\\n“As low as you can,” he answered; “I have excellent ears. If\\nyou would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish\\nfriend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk\\nwith you.”\\n“I have a c ab outside.”\\n“Then pray send him h ome in it. You may safely trust him,\\nfor he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I sho uld\\nrecommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your\\nwife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If yo u\\nwill wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.” It was difficult to\\nrefuse any of Sherlock Holmes’ requests,\\nfor they were always so exceedingly defin ite, and put forward\\nwith such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when\\nWhitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically\\naccomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything\\nbetter than to be associated with my friend in one of those\\nsingular adventures which were the normal condition of hi s\\nexistence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid\\nWhitney’s bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven\\nthrough the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure\\nhad emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down\\nthe street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled\\nalong with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round,\\nhe straightened himself out and burst into a\\nhearty fit of laughter.\\n“I suppose, Watson,” said he, “that you imagine that I have\\nadded opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the oth er\\nlittle weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your\\nmedical views.”\\n“I was certainly surprised to find you there.”\\n“But not more so than I to find you.”\\n“I came to find a friend.”\\n“And I to find an enemy.”\\n“An enemy?”\\n“Yes; one of m y natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural\\nprey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkabl e\\ninquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent\\nramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been\\nrecognised in that den my life would not have been worth an\\nhour’s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and\\nthe rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have\\nvengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the ba ck of that\\nbuilding, near the corner of Paul’s Wharf, which could tell s ome\\nstrange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless\\nnights.”\\n“What! You do not mean bodies?”\\n“Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000\\npounds for every poor devil who has been done to death in\\nthat den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside,\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net175\\nand I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our\\ntrap should be here.” He put his two forefingers between his teeth and\\nwhistled shrilly—a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from\\nthe distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of\\nhorses’ hoofs.\\n“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the\\ngloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side\\nlanterns. “You’ll come with me, won’t you?”\\n“If I can be of use.”\\n“Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My\\nroom at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.”\\n“The Cedars?”\\n“Yes; that is M r. St. Clair’s house. I am staying there while I conduct the\\ninquiry.”\\n“Where i s it, then?”\\n“Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.”\\n“But I am all in the dark.”\\n“Of course you are. You’ ll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All\\nright, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Look out for me tomorrow,\\nabout eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!”\\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the\\nendless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened\\ngradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the\\nmurky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull\\nwilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,\\nregular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated\\nparty of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a\\nstar or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds.\\nHolmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a\\nman who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this\\nnew quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet\\nafraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several\\nmiles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas,\\nwhen he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the\\nair of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\\n“You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,” said he. “It makes y ou quite\\ninvaluable as a companion. ‘Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have\\nsomeone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was\\nwondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she\\nmeets me at the door.”\\n“You forget that I know nothing about it.”\\n“I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee.\\nIt seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon.\\nThere’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end of it into my hand.\\nNow, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe\\nyou can see a spark where all is dark to me.”\\n“Proceed, then.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net177\\n“Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to Lee a\\ngentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of\\nmoney. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived\\ngenerally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood,\\nand in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has\\ntwo children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several\\ncompanies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the\\n5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years\\nof age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate\\nfather, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his\\nwhole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain,\\namount to 88 pounds 10s., while he has 220 pounds standing to his credit in\\nthe Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that\\nmoney troubles have been weighing upon his mind.\\n“Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual,\\nremarking before he started that he had two important commissions to\\nperform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now,\\nby the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday,\\nvery shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of\\nconsiderable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the\\noffices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your\\nLondon, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street,\\nwhich branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night.\\nMrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping,\\nproceeded to the company’s office, got her packet, and found herself at\\nexactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the\\nstation. Have you followed me so far?”\\n“It is very clear.”\\n“If you remembe r, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair\\nwalked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not\\nlike the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking\\nin this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry,\\nand was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it\\nseemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window\\nwas open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being\\nterribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished\\nfrom the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked\\nback by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which\\nstruck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat,\\nsuch as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\\n“Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps\\n—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me\\nto-night—and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the\\nstairs which led to\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net179\\nthe first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar\\nscoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a\\nDane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with\\nthe most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare\\ngood-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an\\ninspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men\\naccompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the\\nproprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last\\nbeen seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor\\nthere was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who,\\nit seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no\\none else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined\\nwas their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to\\nbelieve that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at\\na small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there\\nfell a cascade of children’s bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to\\nbring home.\\n“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made\\nthe inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully\\nexamined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room\\nwas plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which\\nlooked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the\\nbedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at\\nhigh tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window\\nwas a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood\\nwere to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were\\nvisible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain\\nin the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the\\nexception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were\\nthere. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and\\nthere were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he\\nmust apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the\\nominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save\\nhimself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of\\nthe tragedy.\\n“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in\\nthe matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but\\nas, by Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the\\nstair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance at the window,\\nhe could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence\\nwas one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge\\nas to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in\\nany way for the presence of the missing gentleman’s clothes.\\n“So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net181\\ncripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was\\ncertainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His\\nname is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every\\nman who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in\\norder to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax\\nvestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the lefthand\\nside, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it\\nis that this creature takes his daily seat, crosslegged with his tiny stock of\\nmatches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity\\ndescends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside\\nhim. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of\\nmaking his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the\\nharvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so\\nremarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of\\norange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its\\ncontraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin,\\nand a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast\\nto the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of\\nmendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any\\npiece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the\\nman whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to\\nhave been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.”\\n“But a cripple!” said I. “What could he have done singlehanded against a\\nman in the prime of life?”\\n“He is a cripple in the sen se that he walks with a limp; but in other respects\\nhe appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical\\nexperience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often\\ncompensated for by exceptional strength in the others.”\\n“Pray continue your narrative.”\\n“Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at t he sight of the blood upon the window, and\\nshe was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of\\nno help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of\\nthe case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without\\nfinding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had\\nbeen made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few\\nminutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the\\nLascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched,\\nwithout anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it\\nis true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his\\nring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the\\nbleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long\\nbefore, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless\\nfrom the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net183\\nSt. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much\\na mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair’s assertion that she\\nhad actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must\\nhave been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to\\nthe policestation, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the\\nhope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\\n“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had\\nfeared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St. Clair,\\nwhich lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found\\nin the pockets?”\\n“I cannot imagine.”\\n“No, I don’t think y ou would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and\\nhalf-pennies—421 pennies and 270 halfpennies. It was no wonder that it\\nhad not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different\\nmatter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed\\nlikely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body\\nhad been sucked away into the river.”\\n“But I understand that all the other cl othes were found in the room. Would\\nthe body be dressed in a coat alone?”\\n“No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this\\nman Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no\\nhuman eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It\\nwould of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale\\ngarments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out,\\nwhen it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little\\ntime, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force\\nher way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate\\nthat the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost.\\nHe rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his\\nbeggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the\\npockets to make sure of the coat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would\\nhave done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of\\nsteps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police\\nappeared.”\\n“It certainl y sounds feasible.”\\n“Well, we will take it as a wo rking hypothesis for want of a better. Boone,\\nas I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be\\nshown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for\\nyears been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have\\nbeen a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and\\nthe questions which have to be solved—what Neville St. Clair was doing in\\nthe opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and\\nwhat Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance—are all as far from a\\nsolution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my\\nexperience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which\\npresented such difficulties.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net185\\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we\\nhad been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last\\nstraggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country\\nhedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through\\ntwo scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.\\n“We are on the outskirts of Lee,” said my companion. “We have touched on\\nthree English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing\\nover an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees?\\nThat is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears\\nhave already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse’s feet.”\\n“But why are you not conducting the case from Baker\\nStreet?” I asked.\\n“Because there a re many inquiries which must be made out\\nhere. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my d isposal, and you\\nmay rest assured that she will have nothing but\\na welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate t o meet her,\\nWatson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are .\\nWhoa, there, whoa!”\\nWe had pulled up in f ront of a large villa which stood within\\nits own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head ,\\nand springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding\\ngravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the\\ndoor flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in\\nsome sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at\\nher neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of\\nlight, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body\\nslightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a\\nstanding question.\\n“Well?” she cried, “well?” And then, seeing that there were two of us, she\\ngave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion\\nshook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\\n“No good news?”\\n“None.”\\n“No bad ?”\\n“No.”\\n“Than k God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a\\nlong day.”\\n“This is m y friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in\\nseveral of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to\\nbring him out and associate him with this investigation.”\\n“I am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my hand warmly. “You will,\\nI am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when\\nyou consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.”\\n“My dear madam,” said I, “I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can\\nvery well see that no apology is needed. If I can\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net187 be of any assistance, either t o you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed\\nhappy.”\\n“Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said the lady as we entered a well-lit diningroom,\\nupon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, “I should\\nvery much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that\\nyou will give a plain answer.”\\n“Certainly, madam.”\\n“Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to\\nfainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.”\\n“Upon what point?”\\n“In your heart of hea rts, do you think that Neville is alive?”\\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the que stion. “Frankly,\\nnow!” she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him\\nas he leaned back in a basketchair.\\n“Frankly, then, madam, I do not.”\\n“You think that he is dead?”\\n“I do.”\\n“Murde red?”\\n“I don’t say th at. Perhaps.”\\n“And on what day did he m eet his death?”\\n“On Monday.”\\n“Then perhaps , Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is\\nthat I have received a letter from him to-day.”\\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.\\n“What!” he roared.\\n“Yes, to-day.” She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.\\n“May I see it?”\\n“Certainly.”\\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the\\ntable he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair\\nand was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one\\nand was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that\\nvery day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.\\n“Coarse writing,” murmured Holmes. “Surely this is not your husband’s\\nwriting, madam.”\\n“No, but the enclo sure is.”\\n“I perceive also that whoev er addressed the envelope had to go and inquire\\nas to the address.”\\n“How can you tell that?”\\n“The name, you see, is i n perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The\\nrest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used.\\nIf it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep\\nblack shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a\\npause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not\\nfamiliar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as\\ntrifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha!\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net189\\nthere has been an enclosure here!”\\n“Yes, there was a ring. His signet-r ing.”\\n“And you are sure that this is your husba nd’s hand?” “One of his hands.”\\n“One?”\\n“His ha nd when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his\\nusual writing, and yet I know it well.”\\n“‘Dearest do not be frightened. All wil l come well. There is\\na huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wa it\\nin patience.—NEVILLE.’ Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf\\nof a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in\\nGravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has\\nbeen gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who\\nhad been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is\\nyour husband’s hand, madam?”\\n“None. Neville wrote those wor ds.”\\n“And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St.\\nClair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say\\nthat the danger is over.”\\n“But he must be alive, M r. Holmes.”\\n“Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.\\nThe ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken\\nfrom him.”\\n“No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!”\\n“Very well. It may, however, have been w ritten on Monday\\nand only posted to-day.”\\n“That is possible.”\\n“If so, much may h ave happened between.”\\n“Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holm es. I know\\nthat all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy b etween\\nus that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day\\nthat I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in\\nthe dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that\\nsomething had happened. Do you think that I would\\nrespond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his d eath?” “I have seen too\\nmuch not to know that the impression of a\\nwoman may be more valuable than the con clusion of an analytical reasoner.\\nAnd in this letter you certainly have a very\\nstrong piece of evidence to corroborate you r view. But if your\\nhusband is alive and able to write letters, why should he rema in away from\\nyou?”\\n“I can not imagine. It is unthinkable.”\\n“And on Monday he made no remark s before leaving you?” “No.”\\n“And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?” “Very mu ch so.”\\n“Was the window open?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Then he might have called to you?”\\n“He might.”\\n“He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?” “Yes.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net191\\n“A call for help, you thought?”\\n“Yes. He waved his hands.”\\n“But it might have been a cr y of surprise. Astonishment at\\nthe unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?”\\n“It is possible.”\\n“And you thoug ht he was pulled back?”\\n“He disappeared so suddenly.”\\n“He might have leaped back. Y ou did not see anyone else in the room?”\\n“No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the La scar\\nwas at the foot of the stairs.”\\n“Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes\\non?”\\n“But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.”\\n“Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?”\\n“Never.”\\n“Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?”\\n“Never.”\\n“Thank y ou, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I\\nwished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then\\nretire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.”\\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room ha d been placed at our\\ndisposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my\\nnight of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he\\nhad an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a\\nweek, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from\\nevery point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself\\nthat his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now\\npreparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on\\na large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting\\npillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these\\nhe constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself\\ncross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out\\nin front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old\\nbriar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the\\nceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the\\nlight shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off\\nto sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up,\\nand I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still\\nbetween his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a\\ndense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had\\nseen upon the previous night.\\n“Awake, Watson?” he asked.\\n“Yes.”\\n“Game for a morning drive?”\\n“Certainly.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net193\\n“Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps,\\nand we shall soon have the trap out.” He chuckled to himself as he spoke,\\nhis eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of\\nthe previous night.\\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was\\nstirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when\\nHolmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.\\n“I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his boots. “I\\nthink, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most\\nabsolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross.\\nBut I think I have the key of the affair now.”\\n“And where is it?” I asked, smiling.\\n“In the bathroom,” he answered. “O h, yes, I am not joking,” he continued,\\nseeing my look of incredulity. “I have just been there, and I have taken it\\nout, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall\\nsee whether it will not fit the lock.”\\nWe made our way downstairs as qu ietly as possible, and out into the bright\\nmorning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad\\nstable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed\\ndown the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in\\nvegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as\\nsilent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\\n“It has been in some points a singular case ,” said Holmes, flicking the horse\\non into a gallop. “I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is\\nbetter to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.”\\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their\\nwindows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down\\nthe Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up\\nWellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow\\nStreet. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two\\nconstables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse’s head while\\nthe other led us in.\\n“Who is on duty?” asked Holmes.\\n“Inspector Bradstreet, sir.”\\n“Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?” A tall, stout official had come down the\\nstone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. “I wish to have a\\nquiet word with you, Bradstreet.” “Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my\\nroom here.” It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the\\ntable, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at\\nhis desk.\\n“What ca n I do for you, Mr. Holmes?”\\n“I called about that beggarman, Boo ne—the one who was charged with\\nbeing concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net195\\n“Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.”\\n“So I heard. You have him here?”\\n“In the cells.”\\n“Is he quiet?”\\n“Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.”\\n“Dirty?”\\n“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as\\nblack as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a\\nregular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me\\nthat he needed it.”\\n“I should like to se e him very much.”\\n“Would you? That is easily done. Com e this way. You can leave your bag.”\\n“No, I think that I’ll take it.”\\n“Very good. Come this way , if you please.” He led us down a passage,\\nopened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a\\nwhitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\\n“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “He re it is!” He quietly\\nshot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.\\n“He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very well.”\\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards\\nus, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middlesized\\nman, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt\\nprotruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had\\nsaid, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not\\nconceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right\\nacross it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of\\nthe upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock\\nof very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\\n“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.\\n“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked H olmes. “I had an idea that he\\nmight, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” He opened the\\nGladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large\\nbath-sponge.\\n“He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.\\n“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we\\nwill soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”\\n“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “He do esn’t look a credit\\nto the Bow Street cells, does he?” He slipped his key into the lock, and we\\nall very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled\\ndown once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug,\\nmoistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down\\nthe prisoner’s face.\\n“Let me introduce y ou,” he shouted, “to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the\\ncounty of Kent.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net197\\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off under\\nthe sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone,\\ntoo, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip\\nwhich had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the\\ntangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced,\\nrefined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes\\nand staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising\\nthe exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face\\nto the pillow.\\n“Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the missing man. I know\\nhim from the photograph.”\\nThe prisoner turned with th e reckless air of a man who abandons himself to\\nhis destiny. “Be it so,” said he. “And pray what am I charged with?”\\n“With making away with Mr. Neville St.— Oh, come, you can’t be charged\\nwith that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,” said the\\ninspector with a grin. “Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force,\\nbut this really takes the cake.”\\n“If I am Mr. Neville St. Clai r, then it is obvious that no crime has been\\ncommitted, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.”\\n“No crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said Holmes. “You\\nwould have done better to have trusted you wife.”\\n“It was not the wife; it was the children,” groane d the prisoner. “God help\\nme, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an\\nexposure! What can I do?”\\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly\\non the shoulder.\\n“If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said he, “of course\\nyou can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the\\npolice authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know\\nthat there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers.\\nInspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you\\nmight tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then\\nnever go into court at all.”\\n“God bless you!” cried th e prisoner passionately. “I would have endured\\nimprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret\\nas a family blot to my children.\\n“You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a\\nschoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I\\ntravelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an\\nevening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of\\narticles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them.\\nThere was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by\\ntrying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base\\nmy articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of\\nmaking up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took\\nadvantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as\\npitiable as\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net199\\npossible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the\\naid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair,\\nand an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city,\\nostensibly as a matchseller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied\\nmy trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise\\nthat I had received no less than 26s. 4d.\\n“I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time\\nlater, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for 25\\npounds. I was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea\\ncame to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked for a\\nholiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under\\nmy disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\\n“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at 2\\npounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing\\nmy face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It\\nwas a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at\\nlast, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had\\nfirst chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with\\ncoppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in\\nwhich I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning\\nemerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a\\nwell-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me\\nfor his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\\n“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I\\ndo not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn 700 pounds\\na year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional\\nadvantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee,\\nwhich improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in\\nthe City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me,\\nand it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pounds.\\n“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and\\neventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real\\noccupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little\\nknew what.\\n“Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room\\nabove the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my\\nhorror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her\\neyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover\\nmy face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent\\nanyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that\\nshe could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a\\nbeggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not\\npierce so complete a\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net201\\ndisguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the\\nroom, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window,\\nreopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in\\nthe bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by\\nthe coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I\\ncarried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the\\nThames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there\\nwas a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather,\\nI confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St.\\nClair, I was arrested as his murderer.\\n“I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was\\ndetermined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my\\npreference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly\\nanxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment\\nwhen no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling\\nher that she had no cause to fear.”\\n“That note only reached her yesterday,” said Holmes. “Good God! What a\\nweek she must have spent!” “The police have watched this Lascar,” said\\nInspector\\nBradstreet, “and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post\\na letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his,\\nwho forgot all about it for some days.”\\n“That was it,” said Holmes, nodding ap provingly; “I have\\nno doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?”\\n“Many times; but what was a fine to me?”\\n“It must stop here, however,” said Bradstr eet. “If the police are to hush this\\nthing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.”\\n“I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.”\\n“In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken.\\nBut if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes,\\nthat we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I\\nwish I knew how you reach your results.”\\n“I reached this one,” said my friend, “ by sitting upon five pillows and\\nconsuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker\\nStreet we shall just be in time for breakfast.”\\n7.\\nThe Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle.\\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning\\nafter Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the\\nseason. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a piperack\\nwithin his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers,\\nevidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden\\nchair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hardfelt\\nhat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and\\na forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been\\nsuspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.\\n“You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt you.” “Not at all. I am glad\\nto have a friend with whom I can\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net203\\ndiscuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one”—he jerked his\\nthumb in the direction of the old hat—”but there are points in connection\\nwith it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.”\\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling\\nfire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice\\ncrystals. “I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as it looks, this thing has\\nsome deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clue which will guide you in\\nthe solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.”\\n“No, no. No crime,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “Only one of those\\nwhimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million\\nhuman beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles.\\nAmid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every\\npossible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a\\nlittle problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without\\nbeing criminal. We have already had experience of such.”\\n“So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six cases which I have added to\\nmy notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.”\\n“Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to\\nthe singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man\\nwith the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall\\ninto the same\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net205\\ninnocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?” “Yes.”\\n“It is to him that this trophy belongs.”\\n“It is his hat.”\\n“No, no, he fo und it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you\\nwill look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem.\\nAnd, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in\\ncompany with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this\\nmoment in front of Peterson’s fire. The facts are these: about four o’clock\\non Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow,\\nwas returning from some small jollification and was making his way\\nhomeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the\\ngaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white\\ngoose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a\\nrow broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the\\nlatter knocked off the man’s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend\\nhimself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind\\nhim. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants;\\nbut the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an officiallooking\\nperson in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to\\nhis heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the\\nback of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance\\nof Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also\\nof the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most\\nunimpeachable Christmas goose.”\\n“Which surely he restored to their owner?”\\n“My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that ‘For Mrs. Henry\\nBaker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird’s left leg,\\nand it is also true that the initials ‘H. B.’ are legible upon the lining of this\\nhat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of\\nHenry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to\\nany one of them.”\\n“What, then, did P eterson do?”\\n“He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,\\nknowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose\\nwe retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the\\nslight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary\\ndelay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of\\na goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who\\nlost his Christmas dinner.”\\n“Did he not advertise?”\\n“No.”\\n“Then , what clue could you have as to his identity?”\\n“Only as much as we can deduce.”\\n“From his hat?”\\n“Precisely.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net207\\n“But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?”\\n“Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yours elf as\\nto the individuality of the man who has worn this article?”\\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It\\nwas a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the\\nworse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal\\ndiscoloured. There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the\\ninitials “H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for\\na hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked,\\nexceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to\\nhave been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them\\nwith ink.\\n“I can see nothing,” said I, handing it back to my friend.\\n“On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. Yo u fail, however, to\\nreason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.”\\n“Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”\\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fa shion which\\nwas characteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have\\nbeen,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences which are very\\ndistinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of\\nprobability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon\\nthe face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three\\nyears, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has\\nless now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when\\ntaken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil\\ninfluence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the\\nobvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.”\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\n“He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,” he continued,\\ndisregarding my remonstrance. “He is a man who leads a sedentary life,\\ngoes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair\\nwhich he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with\\nlime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from\\nhis hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid\\non in his house.”\\n“You are certainl y joking, Holmes.”\\n“Not in the least. Is it possible that e ven now, when I give you these results,\\nyou are unable to see how they are attained?”\\n“I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable\\nto follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was\\nintellectual?”\\nFor answer H olmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the\\nforehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question of cubic\\ncapacity,” said he; “a man with so\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net209\\nlarge a brain must have something in it.”\\n“The decline of his fortunes, then?”\\n“This hat is three years old. These fl at brims curled at the\\nedge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of\\nribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so\\nexpensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has\\nassuredly gone down in the world.”\\n“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the\\nmoral retrogression?”\\nSherlock Holmes laug hed. “Here is the foresight,” said he putting his finger\\nupon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They are never sold upon\\nhats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight,\\nsince he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But\\nsince we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it,\\nit is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct\\nproof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to\\nconceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which\\nis a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”\\n“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”\\n“The further points, that he is middle-a ged, that his hair is grizzled, that it\\nhas been recently cut, and that he uses limecream, are all to be gathered\\nfrom a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses\\na large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all\\nappear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This\\ndust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy\\nbrown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of\\nthe time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that\\nthe wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best\\nof training.”\\n“But his wif e—you said that she had ceased to love him.” “This hat has not\\nbeen brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week’s\\naccumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go\\nout in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough\\nto lose your wife’s affection.”\\n“But he might be a bachelor.”\\n“Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.\\nRemember the card upon the bird’s leg.” “You have an answer to\\neverything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his\\nhouse?” “One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I\\nsee no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual\\nmust be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks upstairs\\nat night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the\\nother. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you\\nsatisfied?”\\n“Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since, as\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net211\\nyou said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done\\nsave the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.”\\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open,\\nand Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed\\ncheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\\n“The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!” he gasped. “Eh? What of it,\\nthen? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?”\\nHolmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the\\nman’s excited face.\\n“See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!” He held out his hand\\nand displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue\\nstone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that\\nit twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.\\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. “By Jove, Peterson!” s aid he, “this\\nis treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?”\\n“A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as thoug h it were\\nputty.”\\n“It’s m ore than a precious stone. It is the precious stone.”\\n“Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!” I ejaculat ed.\\n“Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the\\nadvertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely\\nunique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of\\n1000 pounds is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.”\\n“A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!” The commissionaire plumped\\ndown into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\\n“That is the reward, and I have reason to know that th ere are sentimental\\nconsiderations in the background which would induce the Countess to part\\nwith half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.”\\n“It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopo litan,” I remarked.\\n“Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a\\nplumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s jewel-case.\\nThe evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to\\nthe Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.” He\\nrummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he\\nsmoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:\\n“Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumbe r, was\\nbrought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from\\nthe jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the\\nblue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence\\nto the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net213\\nthe Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might\\nsolder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with\\nHorner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he\\nfound that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open,\\nand that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the\\nCountess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the\\ndressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the\\nsame evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in\\nhis rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having\\nheard Ryder’s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having\\nrushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last\\nwitness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of\\nHorner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the\\nstrongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been\\ngiven against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with\\nthe offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of\\nintense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and\\nwas carried out of court.”\\n“Hum! So much for the police-court,” said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing\\naside the paper. “The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events\\nleading from a rifled jewelcase at one end to the crop of a goose in\\nTottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions\\nhave suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect.\\nHere is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from\\nMr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other\\ncharacteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves\\nvery seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has\\nplayed in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means\\nfirst, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening\\npapers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.”\\n“What will you say?”\\n“Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: ‘Found at the corner of\\nGoodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the\\nsame by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.’ That is clear\\nand concise.”\\n“Very. But wi ll he see it?”\\n“Well, he is sure to keep a n eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss\\nwas a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the\\nwindow and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but\\nflight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which\\ncaused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will\\ncause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to\\nit. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this\\nput in the evening papers.”\\n“In which, sir?”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net215 “Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall M all, St. James’s, Evening\\nNews, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.” “Very well, sir.\\nAnd this stone?”\\n“Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say,\\nPeterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for\\nwe must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your\\nfamily is now devouring.”\\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it\\nagainst the light. “It’s a bonny thing,” said he. “Just see how it glints and\\nsparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is.\\nThey are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may\\nstand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found\\nin the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in\\nhaving every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade\\ninstead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history.\\nThere have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several\\nrobberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of\\ncrystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a\\npurveyor to the gallows and the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now\\nand drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.”\\n“Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?” “I cannot tell.”\\n“Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry\\nBaker, had anything to do with the matter?”\\n“It is, I think, much more likely that Henry B aker is an\\nabsolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which\\nhe was carrying was of considerably more value than if it wer e\\nmade of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very\\nsimple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.” “An d you can do\\nnothing until then?”\\n“Nothing.”\\n“In that cas e I shall continue my professional round. But I\\nshall come back in the evening at the hour you have menti oned, for I should\\nlike to see the solution of so tangled a\\nbusiness.”\\n“Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock,\\nI believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I\\nought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.”\\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a litt le after halfpast six when I\\nfound myself in Baker Street once more. As I\\napproached the house I saw a tall man in a Sc otch bonnet with\\na coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in\\nthe bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. J ust\\nas I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown u p together to\\nHolmes’ room.\\n“Mr. Henry Bak er, I believe,” said he, rising from his armchair and greeting\\nhis visitor with the easy air of geniality which\\nhe could so readily assume. “Pray take this chair by the fire,\\nMr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circula\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net217\\ntion is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just\\ncome at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?”\\n“Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.”\\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad,\\nintelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch\\nof red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand,\\nrecalled Holmes’ surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was\\nbuttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists\\nprotruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a\\nslow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the\\nimpression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage\\nat the hands of fortune.\\n“We have retained these things for some days,” said Holmes, “because we\\nexpected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a\\nloss to know now why you did not advertise.”\\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been so\\nplentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt that the\\ngang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I\\ndid not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering\\nthem.”\\n“Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.”\\n“To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\\n“Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not don e so. But I\\npresume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same\\nweight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?”\\n“Oh, certainly, certainly,” answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\\n“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of y our own\\nbird, so if you wish—”\\nThe man burst into a he arty laugh. “They might be useful to me as relics of\\nmy adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see what use the\\ndisjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I\\nthink that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the\\nexcellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.”\\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me wit h a slight shrug of his\\nshoulders.\\n“There is y our hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By the way, would\\nit bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of\\na fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.”\\n“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained\\nproperty under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn,\\nnear the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day,\\nyou understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a\\ngoose\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net219\\nclub, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were\\neach to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is\\nfamiliar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted\\nneither to my years nor my gravity.” With a comical pomposity of manner\\nhe bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\\n“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes when he had closed the door\\nbehind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the\\nmatter. Are you hungry, Watson?”\\n“Not particularly.”\\n“Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this\\nclue while it is still hot.”\\n“By all means.”\\nIt was a bitter n ight, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about\\nour throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and\\nthe breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots.\\nOur footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors’\\nquarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into\\nOxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha\\nInn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which\\nruns down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar\\nand ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, whiteaproned\\nlandlord.\\n“Your be er should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,” said he.\\n“My geese!” The man seemed surprised.\\n“Yes. I was speaking only half an hour a go to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a\\nmember of your goose club.”\\n“Ah! yes, I see. But you see, s ir, them’s not our geese.”\\n“Indeed! Whose, then?”\\n“Well, I got the two doze n from a salesman in Covent Garden.”\\n“Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?”\\n“Breckinridge is his name.”\\n“Ah! I don’t know him. Well, here’s your good health landlord, and\\nprosperity to your house. Good-night.”\\n“Now for Mr. Breckinridge,” he cont inued, buttoning up his coat as we\\ncame out into the frosty air. “Remember, Watson that though we have so\\nhomely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a\\nman who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless we can\\nestablish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his\\nguilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been\\nmissed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands.\\nLet us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick\\nmarch!”\\nWe pass ed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of\\nslums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of\\nBreckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp\\nface and\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net221\\ntrim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters. “Good-evening.\\nIt’s a cold night,” said Holmes. The salesman nodded and shot a\\nquestioning glance at my\\ncompanion.\\n“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at\\nthe bare slabs of marble.\\n“Let you have five hundr ed to-morrow morning.” “That’s no good.”\\n“Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.” “Ah, bu t I was\\nrecommended to you.”\\n“Who by?”\\n“The landlo rd of the Alpha.”\\n“Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.”\\n“Fine birds they were, too. Now where d id you get them\\nfrom?”\\nTo my s urprise the question provoked a burst of anger from\\nthe salesman.\\n“Now, then, m ister,” said he, with his head cocked and his\\narms akimbo, “what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight,\\nnow.”\\n“It is s traight enough. I should like to know who sold you\\nthe geese which you supplied to the Alpha.”\\n“Well then, I shan’t tell you. So now!”\\n“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; bu t I don’t know why\\nyou should be so warm over such a trifle.”\\n“Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I\\npay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business;\\nbut it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the geese to?’ and\\n‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they were the only\\ngeese in the\\nworld, to he ar the fuss that is made over them.”\\n“Well, I have no connection with any other peop le who\\nhave been making inquiries,” said Holmes carelessly. “I f you\\nwon’t tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I’m always ready to\\nback my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it\\nthat the bird I ate is country bred.”\\n“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,”\\nsnapped the salesman.\\n“It’s nothing of the kin d.”\\n“I say it is.”\\n“I don’t beli eve it.”\\n“D’you think you k now more about fowls than I, who have\\nhandled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those\\nbirds that went to the Alpha were town bred.”\\n“You’ll never persuade me to believe that.”\\n“Will you bet, then?”\\n“It’s merely taking yo ur money, for I know that I am right.\\nBut I’ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to\\nbe obstinate.”\\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. “Bring me the books, Bill,”\\nsaid he.\\nThe sma ll boy brought round a small thin volume and a\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net223 great greasy-backed one, lay ing them out together beneath the hanging\\nlamp.\\n“Now then, Mr. Cocksure,” said the salesman, “I thought that I was out of\\ngeese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still one left in my shop.\\nYou see this little book?”\\n“Well?”\\n“That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see? Well, then, here on\\nthis page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where\\ntheir accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in\\nred ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third\\nname. Just read it out to me.”\\n“Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,” read Holmes.\\n“Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.”\\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. “He re you are, ‘Mrs. Oakshott, 117,\\nBrixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’”\\n“Now, then, what’s the last entry?”\\n“‘December 22nd. Twenty-four gee se at 7s. 6d.’”\\n“Quite so. There you are. And underneath?”\\n“‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s .’”\\n“What have you to say now?”\\nSherlock Holmes looked deep ly chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his\\npocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man\\nwhose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a\\nlamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar\\nto him.\\n“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink ‘un’\\nprotruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,” said he. “I\\ndaresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of him, that man would\\nnot have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by\\nthe idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy,\\nnearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be\\ndetermined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or\\nwhether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly\\nfellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about\\nthe matter, and I should—”\\nHis remarks were suddenl y cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out\\nfrom the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced\\nfellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown\\nby the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door\\nof his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\\n“I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “I wish you were all\\nat the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk\\nI’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I’ll answer her, but\\nwhat have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?”\\n“No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the l ittle man.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net225\\n“Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”\\n“She told me to ask you.”\\n“Well, you can ask the Kin g of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve\\nhad enough of it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the\\ninquirer flitted away into the darkness.\\n“Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes. “Come\\nwith me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.” Striding\\nthrough the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls,\\nmy companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the\\nshoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every\\nvestige of colour had been driven from his face.\\n“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked in a quavering voice.\\n“You will excuse me,” said Holmes blandly, “but I could not h elp\\noverhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think\\nthat I could be of assistance to you.”\\n“You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?”\\n“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people\\ndon’t know.”\\n“But you can know nothing of this?”\\n“Excuse me, I know everything of i t. You are endeavouring to trace some\\ngeese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman\\nnamed Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by\\nhim to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.”\\n“Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to me et,” cried the little\\nfellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. “I can hardly explain\\nto you how interested I am in this matter.”\\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler wh ich was passing. “In that case we\\nhad better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept marketplace,”\\nsaid he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have\\nthe pleasure of assisting.”\\nThe man hesitated for an instant. “My name is John Robinson,” he\\nanswered with a sidelong glance.\\n“No, no; the real name,” said Ho lmes sweetly. “It is always awkward doing\\nbusiness with an alias.”\\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. “Well then,” said he,\\n“my real name is James Ryder.”\\n“Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the\\ncab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to\\nknow.”\\nThe lit tle man stood glancing from one to the other of us with halffrightened,\\nhalf-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the\\nverge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in\\nhalf an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had\\nbeen said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new\\ncompanion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands,\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net227\\nspoke of the nervous tension within him.\\n“Here we are!” said Holmes cheerily as w e filed into the\\nroom. “The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. Yo u look\\ncold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on\\nmy slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now,\\nthen! You want to know what became of those geese?” “Yes , sir.”\\n“Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine\\nin which you were interested—white, with a black bar acros s\\nthe tail.”\\nRyder qu ivered with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you\\ntell me where it went to?”\\n“It came here.”\\n“Here?”\\n“Yes, an d a most remarkable bird it proved. I don’t wonder\\nthat you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it w as\\ndead—the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen .\\nI have it here in my museum.”\\nOur visitor staggered to his fee t and clutched the mantelpiece with his right\\nhand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box\\nand held up the blue carbuncle, which s hone out like a star,\\nwith a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stoo d glaring with a\\ndrawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown\\nit.\\n“T he game’s up, Ryder,” said Holmes quietly. “Hold up,\\nman, or you’ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back int o his chair, Watson.\\nHe’s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a\\ndash of brandy. So! Now he looks a\\nlittle more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!” For a moment he had\\nstaggered and nearly fallen, but the\\nbrandy brought a tinge of colour int o his cheeks, and he sat\\nstaring with frightened eyes at his accuser.\\n“I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs\\nwhich I could possibly need, so there is little which you n eed\\ntell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the\\ncase complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the\\nCountess of Morcar’s?”\\n“It was Catherine Cusac k who told me of it,” said he in a\\ncrackling voice.\\n“I see—her lady ship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation\\nof sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you , as it\\nhas been for better men before you; but you were not very scrup ulous in the\\nmeans you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there\\nis the making of a very pretty villain in you. You k new that this\\nman Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such\\nmatter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily\\nupon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job\\nin my lady’s room—you and your confederate Cusack—and\\nyou managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when\\nhe had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and ha d\\nthis unfortunate man arrested. You then—”\\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon t he rug and\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net229\\nclutched at my companion’s knees. “For God’s sake, have mercy!” he\\nshrieked. “Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I\\nnever went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I’ll swear it on a\\nBible. Oh, don’t bring it into court! For Christ’s sake, don’t!”\\n“Get back into your chair!” said Holmes sternly. “It is very well to cringe\\nand crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the\\ndock for a crime of which he knew nothing.”\\n“I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against\\nhim will break down.”\\n“Hum! We will talk ab out that. And now let us hear a true account of the\\nnext act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into\\nthe open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.”\\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “I will tell you it just as it\\nhappened, sir,” said he. “When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me\\nthat it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not\\nknow at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search\\nme and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be\\nsafe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister’s\\nhouse. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road,\\nwhere she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met\\nseemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold\\nnight, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton\\nRoad. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I\\ntold her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went\\ninto the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best\\nto do.\\n“I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just\\nbeen serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into\\ntalk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they\\nstole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things\\nabout him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived,\\nand take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone\\ninto money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had\\ngone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized\\nand searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was\\nleaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were\\nwaddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head\\nwhich showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.\\n“My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her\\ngeese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as\\nher word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to\\nKilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of\\nthe birds— a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net231\\nits bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could\\nreach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and\\ndown into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my\\nsister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute\\nbroke loose and fluttered off among the others.\\n“‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ says she.\\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me one for Christmas, and I was\\nfeeling which was the fattest.’\\n“‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yo urs aside for you—Jem’s bird, we call it. It’s\\nthe big white one over yonder. There’s twentysix of them, which makes one\\nfor you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.’\\n“‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the sam e to you, I’d rather\\nhave that one I was handling just now.’\\n“‘The other is a good three pound he avier,’ said she, ‘and we fattened it\\nexpressly for you.’\\n“‘Never mind. I’ll h ave the other, and I’ll take it now,’ said I.\\n“‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed. ‘Which i s it you want,\\nthen?’\\n“‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.’\\n“‘Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.’\\n“Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to\\nKilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to\\ntell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and\\nopened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the\\nstone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird,\\nrushed back to my sister’s, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a\\nbird to be seen there.\\n“‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.\\n“‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.’\\n“‘Which dealer’s?’\\n“‘Breckinridge, of C ovent Garden.’\\n“‘But was there another with a barr ed tail?’ I asked, ‘the same as the one I\\nchose?’\\n“‘Yes, J em; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them\\napart.’\\n“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would\\ncarry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not\\none word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him\\nyourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister\\nthinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now\\n— and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the\\nwealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!” He burst\\ninto convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.\\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy brea thing and by the\\nmeasured tapping of Sherlock Holmes’ finger\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net233\\ntips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the\\ndoor.\\n“Get out!” said he.\\n“What, sir! Oh, He aven bless you!”\\n“No more words. Get out!”\\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the\\nstairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the\\nstreet.\\n“After all, Watson,” said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, “I\\nam not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in\\ndanger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against\\nhim, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony,\\nbut it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong\\nagain; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you make\\nhim a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has\\nput in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its\\nown reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will\\nbegin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature.”\\n8.\\nThe Adventure of the Speckled Band.\\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during\\nthe last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I\\nfind many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none\\ncommonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for\\nthe acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any\\ninvestigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the\\nfantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which\\npresented more singular features than that which was associated with the\\nwell-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in\\nquestion occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when\\nwe were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I\\nmight\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net235\\nhave placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at\\nthe time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the\\nuntimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as\\nwell that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that\\nthere are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott\\nwhich tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.\\nIt was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find\\nSherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a\\nlate riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it\\nwas only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and\\nperhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\\n“Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he, “but it’s the common lot this\\nmorning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on\\nyou.”\\n“What is it, then—a fire?”\\n“No; a client. It seems tha t a young lady has arrived in a considerable state\\nof excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the\\nsitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this\\nhour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I\\npresume that it is something very pressing which they have to\\ncommunicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am\\nsure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should\\ncall you and give you the chance.”\\n“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”\\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Hol mes in his professional\\ninvestigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions,\\nand yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the\\nproblems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and\\nwas ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the\\nsittingroom. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been\\nsitting in the window, rose as we entered.\\n“Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes cheerily. “My name is Sherlock\\nHolmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom\\nyou can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs.\\nHudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I\\nshall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.”\\n“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman in a low vo ice,\\nchanging her seat as requested.\\n“What, then?”\\n“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her veil as she spoke, and we\\ncould see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all\\ndrawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted\\nanimal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair\\nwas shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net237 and haggard. Sherlock Holm es ran her over with one of his quick, allcomprehensive\\nglances.\\n“You must not fear,” said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her\\nforearm. “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come\\nin by train this morning, I see.”\\n“You know me, then?”\\n“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left\\nglove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dogcart,\\nalong heavy roads, before you reached the station.”\\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\\n“There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “The left arm o f\\nyour jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks\\nare perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up\\nmud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the\\ndriver.”\\n“Whate ver your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,” said she. “I\\nstarted from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came\\nin by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall\\ngo mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none, save only one, who\\ncares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you,\\nMr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in\\nthe hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir,\\ndo you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light\\nthrough the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my\\npower to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall\\nbe married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall\\nnot find me ungrateful.”\\nHolmes turned to his de sk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book,\\nwhich he consulted.\\n“Farintosh,” said he . “Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an\\nopal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam,\\nthat I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of\\nyour friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at\\nliberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits\\nyou best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may\\nhelp us in forming an opinion upon the matter.”\\n“Alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation lies in the fact\\nthat my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon\\nsmall points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of\\nall others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell\\nhim about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I\\ncan read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard,\\nMr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the\\nhuman heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which\\nencompass me.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net239\\n“I am all attention, madam.”\\n“My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the\\nlast survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of\\nStoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”\\nHolmes nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me,” said he.\\n“The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates\\nextended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the\\nwest. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute\\nand wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a\\ngambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of\\nground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a\\nheavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the\\nhorrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather,\\nseeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an\\nadvance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and\\nwent out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of\\ncharacter, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused\\nby some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his\\nnative butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he\\nsuffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a\\nmorose and disappointed man.\\n“When Dr. Roylott was in In dia he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the\\nyoung widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister\\nJulia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my\\nmother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less than\\n1000 pounds a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while\\nwe resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be\\nallowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return\\nto England my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a railway\\naccident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish\\nhimself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old\\nancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was\\nenough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our\\nhappiness.\\n“But a terr ible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of\\nmaking friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first\\nbeen overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat,\\nhe shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in\\nferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper\\napproaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in\\nmy stepfather’s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence\\nin the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended\\nin the policecourt, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net241 folks would fly at his approa ch, for he is a man of immense strength, and\\nabsolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\\n“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and\\nit was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that\\nI was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save\\nthe wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp\\nupon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family\\nestate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering\\naway with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for\\nIndian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has\\nat this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his\\ngrounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.\\n“You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no\\ngreat pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long\\ntime we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her\\ndeath, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.”\\n“Your sister is dead, then?”\\n“She died just two years ag o, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to\\nyou. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we\\nwere little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had,\\nhowever, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who\\nlives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at\\nthis lady’s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there\\na half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather\\nlearned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection\\nto the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for\\nthe wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only\\ncompanion.”\\nSherlock Ho lmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed\\nand his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced\\nacross at his visitor.\\n“Pray be precise as t o details,” said he.\\n“It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared\\ninto my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and\\nonly one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the\\nground floor, the sittingrooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of\\nthese bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott’s, the second my sister’s, and the\\nthird my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open\\nout into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?”\\n“Perfectly so.”\\n“The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night\\nDr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not\\nretired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian\\ncigars which it was\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net243\\nhis custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine,\\nwhere she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At\\neleven o’clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked\\nback.\\n“‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead\\nof the night?’\\n“‘Never,’ said I.\\n“‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?’\\n“‘Certainly not. But why?’\\n“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the\\nmorning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has\\nawakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next\\nroom, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether\\nyou had heard it.’\\n“‘No, I have not. I t must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.’\\n“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did n ot hear\\nit also.’\\n“‘Ah, bu t I sleep more heavily than you.’\\n“‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at me,\\nclosed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.”\\n“Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at\\nnight?”\\n“Alway s.”\\n“And why? ”\\n“I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon.\\nWe had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”\\n“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”\\n“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeli ng of impending misfortune\\nimpressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you\\nknow how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely\\nallied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was\\nbeating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub\\nof the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew\\nthat it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round\\nme, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a\\nlow whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a\\nclanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage,\\nmy sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared\\nat it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the\\nlight of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face\\nblanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying\\nto and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her,\\nbut at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.\\nShe writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully\\nconvulsed. At first I thought that she\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net245\\nhad not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a\\nvoice which I shall never forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The\\nspeckled band!’ There was something else which she would fain have said,\\nand she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor’s\\nroom, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out,\\ncalling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in\\nhis dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious,\\nand though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from\\nthe village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without\\nhaving recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my\\nbeloved sister.”\\n“One moment,” said Holmes, “are you sure about this whistle and metallic\\nsound? Could you swear to it?”\\n“That was what the county coro ner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong\\nimpression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the\\ncreaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”\\n“Was your sister dressed?”\\n“No, she was in her night -dress. In her right hand was found the charred\\nstump of a match, and in her left a match-box.”\\n“Showing that she had struck a light and looke d about her when the alarm\\ntook place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come\\nto?”\\n“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct had\\nlong been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory\\ncause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon\\nthe inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters\\nwith broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were\\ncarefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the\\nflooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney\\nis wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that\\nmy sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no\\nmarks of any violence upon her.”\\n“How about poison?”\\n“The doctors examine d her for it, but without success.”\\n“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, th en?”\\n“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it\\nwas that frightened her I cannot imagine.”\\n“Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?”\\n“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”\\n“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band— a speckled\\nband?”\\n“Somet imes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,\\nsometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to\\nthese very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted\\nhandkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have\\nsuggested the strange\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net247 adjective which she used.”\\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\\n“These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with your narra tive.”\\n“Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lone lier\\nthan ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for\\nmany years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name\\nis Armitage— Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane\\nWater, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match,\\nand we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some\\nrepairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall\\nhas been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my\\nsister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then,\\nmy thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible\\nfate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had\\nbeen the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing\\nwas to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however,\\nso I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at\\nthe Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I\\nhave come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking\\nyour advice.”\\n“You have do ne wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me all?”\\n“Yes, all.”\\n“Miss Roy lott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.”\\n“Why, what do you mean?”\\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the\\nhand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of\\nfour fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\\n“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.\\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is a hard\\nman,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”\\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chi n upon his\\nhands and stared into the crackling fire.\\n“This is a very deep business,” he said at last. “There are a thousand details\\nwhich I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action.\\nYet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran today,\\nwould it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the\\nknowledge of your stepfather?”\\n“As it happens, he spoke of c oming into town to-day upon some most\\nimportant business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there\\nwould be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old\\nand foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net249\\n“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?” “By no means.”\\n“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”\\n“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town.\\nBut I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there in time for\\nyour coming.”\\n“And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small\\nbusiness matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?”\\n“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my\\ntrouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.” She\\ndropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.\\n“And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock\\nHolmes, leaning back in his chair.\\n“It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.” “Dark enough and\\nsinister enough.”\\n“Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and\\nwalls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable,\\nthen her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her\\nmysterious end.”\\n“What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very\\npeculiar words of the dying woman?”\\n“I cannot think.”\\n“When you comb ine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of\\ngipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have\\nevery reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his\\nstepdaughter’s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact\\nthat Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been\\ncaused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into\\nits place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be\\ncleared along those lines.”\\n“But what, then, did the gi psies do?”\\n“I cannot imagine.”\\n“I see many objectio ns to any such theory.”\\n“And so do I. It is precisely for that reas on that we are going to Stoke\\nMoran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may\\nbe explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”\\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our\\ndoor had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed\\nhimself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the\\nprofessional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frockcoat,\\nand a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.\\nSo tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway,\\nand his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face,\\nseared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked\\nwith every evil passion, was\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net251\\nturned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bileshot eyes, and his\\nhigh, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce\\nold bird of prey.\\n“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.\\n“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion\\nquietly.\\n“I am D r. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”\\n“Indeed, Doctor,” said Holmes blandly. “Pray t ake a seat.”\\n“I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been h ere. I have traced\\nher. What has she been saying to you?”\\n“It is a little cold for the time of the yea r,” said Holmes.\\n“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old m an furiously.\\n“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continu ed my\\ncompanion imperturbably.\\n“Ha! You put me off, do y ou?” said our new visitor, taking a step forward\\nand shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of\\nyou before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”\\nMy friend smiled.\\n“Holmes, the busy body!”\\nHis smile broadened.\\n“Holmes, the Scotlan d Yard Jack-in-office!”\\nHolmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversat ion is most entertaining,” said\\nhe. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.”\\n“I will go when I have said my say. Don’t you dare to meddle w ith my\\naffairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a\\ndangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward, seized\\nthe poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\\n“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, an d hurling the\\ntwisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\\n“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughin g. “I am not quite\\nso bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was\\nnot much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up the steel\\npoker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\\n“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with th e official detective\\nforce! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only\\ntrust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing\\nthis brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and\\nafterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’ Commons, where I hope to get\\nsome data which may help us in this matter.”\\nIt was nearly one o’clock when Sherloc k Holmes returned from his\\nexcursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with\\nnotes and figures.\\n“I have seen the w ill of the deceased wife,” said he. “To determine its exact\\nmeaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the\\ninvestments with which it is con\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net253\\ncerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife’s death was little\\nshort of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not\\nmore than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an income of 250 pounds,\\nin case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married,\\nthis beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would\\ncripple him to a very serious extent. My morning’s work has not been\\nwasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for\\nstanding in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too\\nserious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are\\ninteresting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab\\nand drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your\\nrevolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument with\\ngentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are,\\nI think, all that we need.”\\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where\\nwe hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through\\nthe lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few\\nfleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just\\nthrowing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant\\nsmell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between\\nthe sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were\\nengaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat\\npulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the\\ndeepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder,\\nand pointed over the meadows.\\n“Look there!” said he.\\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a\\ngrove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey\\ngables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\\n“Stoke Moran?” said he.\\n“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the driver.\\n“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where w e\\nare going.”\\n“There’s th e village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some\\ndistance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll find it\\nshorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields. There it\\nis, where the lady is walking.”\\n“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading his eyes.\\n“Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”\\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap r attled back on its way to\\nLeatherhead.\\n“I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile, “that this fellow\\nshould think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business.\\nIt may stop his gossip. Good\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net255 afternoon, Miss Stoner. You s ee that we have been as good as our word.”\\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which\\nspoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she cried, shaking\\nhands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone\\nto town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.”\\n“We have had the pleasure of making the doctor’s acquaintance,” said\\nHolmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss\\nStoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\\n“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.” “So it appears.”\\n“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from\\nhim. What will he say when he returns?”\\n“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is some\\none more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lo ck\\nyourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take\\nyou away to your aunt’s at Harrow. Now, we must make the\\nbest use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms\\nwhich we are to examine.”\\nThe building was of grey, l ichen-blotched stone, with a high\\ncentral portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a cra b,\\nthrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows\\nwere broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof\\nwas partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better\\nrepair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds\\nin the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed\\nthat this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected\\nagainst the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there\\nwere no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked\\nslowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention\\nthe outsides of the win\\ndows.\\n“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to\\nsleep, the centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to t he\\nmain building to Dr. Roylott’s chamber?”\\n“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.” “Pending the\\nalterations, as I understand. By the way, there\\ndoes not seem to be any very pressing need fo r repairs at that\\nend wall.”\\n“There we re none. I believe that it was an excuse to move\\nme from my room.”\\n“Ah! that is suggesti ve. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the\\ncorridor from which these three rooms open.\\nThere are windows in it, of course?”\\n“Yes, but very small ones. Too narro w for anyone to pass\\nthrough.”\\n“As you b oth locked your doors at night, your rooms were\\nunapproachable from that side. Now, would you have th e kindness to go\\ninto your room and bar your shutters?”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net257\\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the\\nopen window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but\\nwithout success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to\\nraise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid\\niron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!” said he, scratching his\\nchin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No\\none could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the\\ninside throws any light upon the matter.”\\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three\\nbedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we\\npassed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping,\\nand in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room,\\nwith a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old countryhouses.\\nA brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow whitecounterpaned\\nbed in another, and a dressingtable on the left-hand side of the\\nwindow. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the\\nfurniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The\\nboards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten\\noak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original\\nbuilding of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat\\nsilent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in\\nevery detail of the apartment.\\n“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing to a\\nthick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying\\nupon the pillow.\\n“It goes to the housekeeper’s room.”\\n“It looks newer than the other things? ”\\n“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.” “Your sister asked for it,\\nI suppose?”\\n“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get\\nwhat we wanted for ourselves.”\\n“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull\\nthere. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satis fy\\nmyself as to this floor.” He threw himself down upon his fa ce\\nwith his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and\\nforward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards .\\nThen he did the same with the wood-work with which the\\nchamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed a nd\\nspent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and\\ndown the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and\\ngave it a brisk tug.\\n“Why, it’s a dumm y,” said he.\\n“Won’t it ring?”\\n“No, it is not ev en attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see\\nnow that it is fastened to a hook just above\\nwhere the little opening for the ventilator is.”\\n“How very absurd! I never noticed that before .”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net259\\n“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or two\\nvery singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder\\nmust be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same\\ntrouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”\\n“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.\\n“Done about the same time as the bell-rop e?” remarked\\nHolmes.\\n“Yes, the re were several little changes carried out about that\\ntime.”\\n“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—\\ndummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. W ith\\nyour permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researche s\\ninto the inner apartment.”\\nDr. Grimesby Roylott’s ch amber was larger than that of his\\nstep-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a\\nsmall wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technic al character, an\\narmchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against\\nthe wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the p rincipal\\nthings which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and\\nexamined each and all of them with the keenest interest. “W hat’s in here?”\\nhe asked, tapping the safe.\\n“My stepfather’s business papers.”\\n“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”\\n“Only once, some years ago. I rem ember that it was full of\\npapers.”\\n“There i sn’t a cat in it, for example?”\\n“No. What a strange idea!”\\n“Well, look at this!” He too k up a small saucer of milk which\\nstood on the top of it.\\n“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”\\n“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet\\na saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I\\ndaresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine. ”\\nHe squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined\\nthe seat of it with the greatest attention.\\n“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his lens in his\\npocket. “Hullo! Here is something interesting!”\\nThe object which had caught his eye was a smal l dog lash\\nhung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was cur led\\nupon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord. “Wha t do you make\\nof that, Watson?”\\n“It’s a common en ough lash. But I don’t know why it should\\nbe tied.”\\n“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked\\nworld, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it i s the\\nworst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner,\\nand with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn. ” I had never\\nseen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so\\ndark as it was when we turned from the scen e of this investiga\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net261\\ntion. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss\\nStoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused\\nhimself from his reverie.\\n“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should absolutely\\nfollow my advice in every respect.”\\n“I shall most certainly do so.”\\n“The matter is too serious fo r any hesitation. Your life may depend upon\\nyour compliance.”\\n“I assure you that I am in your hands.”\\n“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room.”\\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\\n“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over\\nthere?”\\n“Yes, th at is the Crown.”\\n“Very good. Your window s would be visible from there?”\\n“Certainly.”\\n“You must c onfine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when\\nyour stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night,\\nyou must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp\\nthere as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which\\nyou are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no\\ndoubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.”\\n“Oh, yes, easily.”\\n“The rest you wil l leave in our hands.”\\n“But what will you do?”\\n“We shall spend the nigh t in your room, and we shall investigate the cause\\nof this noise which has disturbed you.”\\n“I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,” said\\nMiss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.\\n“Perhaps I have.”\\n“Then, for pity’s s ake, tell me what was the cause of my sister’s death.”\\n“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”\\n“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is co rrect, and if she died\\nfrom some sudden fright.”\\n“No, I do not think so. I th ink that there was probably some more tangible\\ncause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned\\nand saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if\\nyou will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon\\ndrive away the dangers that threaten you.”\\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sittingroom\\nat the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window\\nwe could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of\\nStoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive\\npast, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove\\nhim. The boy had some slight difficulty in un\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net263\\ndoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor’s\\nvoice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The\\ntrap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up\\namong the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\\n“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering\\ndarkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a\\ndistinct element of danger.”\\n“Can I be of assistance?”\\n“Your presence might be invaluable.”\\n“Then I shall certainly come.”\\n“It is very kind of you.”\\n“You speak of danger. Y ou have evidently seen more in these\\nrooms than was visible to me.”\\n“No, but I fancy that I may hav e deduced a little more. I\\nimagine that you saw all that I did.”\\n“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what\\npurpose that could answer I confess is more than I can i magine.”\\n“You saw the ventilator, too?”\\n“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing\\nto have a small opening between two rooms. It was so sma ll\\nthat a rat could hardly pass through.”\\n“I knew that we should find a ventila tor before ever we\\ncame to Stoke Moran.”\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\n“Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said\\nthat her sister could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of co urse\\nthat suggested at once that there must be a communication\\nbetween the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it\\nwould have been remarked upon at the coroner’s inq uiry. I deduced a\\nventilator.”\\n“But what h arm can there be in that?”\\n“Well, there is at least a curious coinci dence of dates. A\\nventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the\\nbed dies. Does not that strike you?”\\n“I cannot as yet see any connection. ”\\n“Did you observe anything very pecu liar about that bed?” “No.”\\n“It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastene d like that\\nbefore?”\\n“I cannot say that I have.”\\n“The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the\\nsame relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—or s o\\nwe may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull .” “Holmes,” I\\ncried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time\\nto prevent some subtle and\\nhorrible crime.”\\n“Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does\\ngo wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has\\nknowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of\\ntheir profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think,\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net265\\nWatson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have\\nhorrors enough before the night is over; for goodness’ sake let us have a\\nquiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.”\\nAbout nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was\\ndark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away,\\nand then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone\\nout right in front of us.\\n“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes from the\\nmiddle window.”\\nAs we passed ou t he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining\\nthat we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was\\npossible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out\\non the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light\\ntwinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre\\nerrand.\\nThere w as little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches\\ngaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached\\nthe lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out\\nfrom a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and\\ndistorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and\\nthen ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\\n“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”\\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice\\nupon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his\\nlips to my ear.\\n“It is a nice ho usehold,” he murmured. “That is the baboon.”\\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected . There was a\\ncheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I\\nconfess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes’\\nexample and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My\\ncompanion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table,\\nand cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the\\ndaytime.Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he\\nwhispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to\\ndistinguish the words:\\n“The least sound woul d be fatal to our plans.”\\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\\n“We must sit without light. He wo uld see it through the ventilator.”\\nI nodded again.\\n“Do not go asl eep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol\\nready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in\\nthat chair.”\\nI took out m y revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he plac ed upon the bed\\nbeside him. By it he laid the box of matches and\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net267 the stump of a candle. Then h e turned down the lamp, and we were left in\\ndarkness.\\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not\\neven the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat openeyed,\\nwithin a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which\\nI was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in\\nabsolute darkness.\\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very\\nwindow a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was\\nindeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock,\\nwhich boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those\\nquarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting\\nsilently for whatever might befall.\\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of\\nthe ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong\\nsmell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a\\ndark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent\\nonce more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with\\nstraining ears.Then suddenly another sound became audible— a very\\ngentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually\\nfrom a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed,\\nstruck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.\\n“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”\\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holm es struck\\nthe light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my\\nweary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend\\nlashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and\\nfilled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at\\nthe ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the\\nmost horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and\\nlouder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one\\ndreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the\\ndistant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold\\nto our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last\\nechoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\\n“What can it mean?” I gasped.\\n“It means that it is all over,” H olmes answered. “And perhaps, after all, it is\\nfor the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott’s room.”\\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor . Twice\\nhe struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he\\nturned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my\\nhand.\\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern\\nwith the shutter half open, throwing a\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net269\\nbrilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside\\nthis table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey\\ndressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into\\nred heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the\\nlong lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked\\nupward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the\\nceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish\\nspeckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered\\nhe made neither sound nor motion.\\n“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.\\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and\\nthere reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and\\npuffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\\n“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He has\\ndied within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon\\nthe violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let\\nus thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss\\nStoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has\\nhappened.”\\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and\\nthrowing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid perch\\nand, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed\\nupon it.\\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke\\nMoran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has\\nalready run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to\\nthe terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of\\nher good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came\\nto the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with\\na dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me\\nby Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.\\n“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows,\\nmy dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient\\ndata. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word ‘band,’ which was\\nused by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had\\ncaught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put\\nme upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly\\nreconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that\\nwhatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either\\nfrom the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have\\nalready remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung\\ndown to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was\\nclamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was\\nthere as a bridge for some\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net271\\nthing passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake\\ninstantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the\\ndoctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was\\nprobably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could\\nnot possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as\\nwould occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training.\\nThe rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from\\nhis point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner,\\nindeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would\\nshow where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the\\nwhistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light\\nrevealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk\\nwhich we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through\\nthis ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it\\nwould crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite\\nthe occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner\\nor later she must fall a victim.\\n“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An\\ninspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing\\non it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the\\nventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of\\nwhipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have\\nremained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused\\nby her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible\\noccupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took\\nin order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no\\ndoubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.”\\n“With the result of driving it through the ventilator.” “And also with the\\nresult of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the\\nblows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew\\nupon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible\\nfor Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh\\nvery heavily upon my conscience.”\\n9.\\nThe Adventure of the Engineer’s Thumb.\\nOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock\\nHolmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two\\nwhich I was the means of introducing to his notice—that of Mr. Hatherley’s\\nthumb, and that of Colonel Warburton’s madness. Of these the latter may\\nhave afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other\\nwas so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be\\nthe more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend\\nfewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he\\nachieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told more\\nthan once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much\\nless striking when set forth en bloc in a single half\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net273\\ncolumn of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes,\\nand the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a\\nstep which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances\\nmade a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly\\nserved to weaken the effect.\\nIt was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the events\\noccurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil\\npractice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms,\\nalthough I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to\\nforgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had\\nsteadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from\\nPaddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of\\nthese, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never\\nweary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every\\nsufferer over whom he might have any influence.\\nOne morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the maid\\ntapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington\\nand were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by\\nexperience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs.\\nAs I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the\\ndoor tightly behind him.\\n“I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net275\\nhis shoulder; “he’s all right.”\\n“What is it, then?” I asked, fo r his manner suggested that it\\nwas some strange creature which he had caged up in my r oom. “It’s a new\\npatient,” he whispered. “I thought I’d bring him\\nround myself; then he couldn’t slip away. There he is, all safe\\nand sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the\\nsame as you.” And off he went, this trusty tout, without even\\ngiving me time to thank him.\\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated\\nby the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather twee d\\nwith a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books.\\nRound one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which\\nwas mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more\\nthan five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine\\nface; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impressi on\\nof a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which\\nit took all his strength of mind to control.\\n“I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doc tor,” said he, “but\\nI have had a very serious accident during the night. I came i n\\nby train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to\\nwhere I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly es corted me here. I\\ngave the maid a card, but I see that she has\\nleft it upon the side-table.”\\nI took it up and glanced a t it. “Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer,\\n16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).” That was\\nthe name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. “I regret that I have kept\\nyou waiting,” said I, sitting down in my librarychair. “You are fresh from a\\nnight journey, I understand, which\\nis in itself a monotonous occupatio n.”\\n“Oh, my night could not be called mon otonous,” said he,\\nand laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringin g\\nnote, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my\\nmedical instincts rose up against that laugh.\\n“Stop it!” I cried; “pull yourself together!” a nd I poured out\\nsome water from a caraffe.\\nIt was useless, however. H e was off in one of those hysterical outbursts\\nwhich come upon a strong nature when some\\ngreat crisis is over and gone. Presently he cam e to himself once\\nmore, very weary and pale-looking.\\n“I have been making a fool of myse lf,” he gasped. “Not at all. Drink this.” I\\ndashed some brandy into the water,\\nand the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks. “That’s better!”\\nsaid he. “And now, Doctor, perhaps you\\nwould kindly attend to my thumb, or rat her to the place where\\nmy thumb used to be.”\\nHe unwound the handk erchief and held out his hand. It\\ngave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. T here\\nwere four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface\\nwhere the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or\\ntorn right out from the roots.\\n“Good heavens!” I cried, “th is is a terrible injury. It must\\nhave bled considerably.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net277\\n“Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been\\nsenseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding,\\nso I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced\\nit up with a twig.”\\n“Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.”\\n“It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province.”\\n“This has been done,” said I, examining the wound, “by a very heavy and\\nsharp instrument.”\\n“A thing like a clea ver,” said he.\\n“An accident, I presume?”\\n“By no means.”\\n“What! a murde rous attack?”\\n“Very murderous indeed.”\\n“You horrify me.”\\nI sponged the wou nd, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with\\ncotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing,\\nthough he bit his lip from time to time.\\n“How is that?” I asked when I had finis hed.\\n“Capital! Between your brandy and your ba ndage, I feel a new man. I was\\nvery weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.”\\n“Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to\\nyour nerves.”\\n“Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between\\nourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine,\\nI should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very\\nextraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to\\nback it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are\\nso vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.”\\n“Ha!” cried I, “if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire\\nto see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.”\\n“Oh, I have heard of that fellow,” answered my visit or, “and I should be\\nvery glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the\\nofficial police as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?”\\n“I’ll do better. I’ll take you round to him myself.”\\n“I should be immensely obliged to you.”\\n“We’ll call a cab and go together. We s hall just be in time to have a little\\nbreakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?”\\n“Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.”\\n“Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be wit h you in an instant.” I\\nrushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes\\nwas inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.\\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his\\ndressing-gown, reading the agony column\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net279\\nof The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed\\nof all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all\\ncarefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received\\nus in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined\\nus in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance\\nupon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy\\nand water within his reach.\\n“It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.\\nHatherley,” said he. “Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at\\nhome. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your\\nstrength with a little stimulant.”\\n“Thank you,” said my patient. “but I have felt another man since the doctor\\nbandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall\\ntake up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once\\nupon my peculiar experiences.”\\nHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression\\nwhich veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we\\nlistened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.\\n“You must know,” said he, “that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing\\nalone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I\\nhave had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I\\nwas apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of\\nGreenwich.Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come\\ninto a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I determined to\\nstart in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria\\nStreet.\\n“I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a\\ndreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I\\nhave had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all\\nthat my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to 27 pounds\\n10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I\\nwaited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to\\nbelieve that I should never have any practice at all.\\n“Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk\\nentered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon\\nbusiness. He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘Colonel Lysander\\nStark’ engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man\\nrather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that\\nI have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose\\nand chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his\\noutstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and\\ndue to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing\\nassured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge,\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net281\\nwould be nearer forty than thirty.\\n“‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he, with so mething of a German ac\\ncent. ‘You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as\\nbeing a man who is not only proficient in his profession but i s\\nalso discreet and capable of preserving a secret.’\\n“I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at\\nsuch an address. ‘May I ask who it was who gave me so g ood a\\ncharacter?’\\n“‘Well, perh aps it is better that I should not tell you that\\njust at this moment. I have it from the same source that y ou\\nare both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in\\nLondon.’\\n“‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but you will excuse me\\nif I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon m y professional\\nqualifications. I understand that it was on a professional\\nmatter that you wished to speak to me?’\\n“‘Undoubtedly so. But you will find tha t all I say is really to\\nthe point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is\\nquite essential—absolute secrecy, you understand,\\nand of course we may expect that more from a man who is\\nalone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.’ “‘If I promise to\\nkeep a secret,’ said I, ‘you may absolutely\\ndepend upon my doing so.’\\n“He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me\\nthat I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye. “‘Do you\\npromise, then?’ said he at last.\\n“‘Yes, I promise.’\\n“‘Absolute and co mplete silence before, during, and after?\\nNo reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing? ’ “‘I have already\\ngiven you my word.’\\n“‘Very good.’ He sud denly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the\\nroom he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\\n“‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back. ‘I know that clerks\\nare sometimes curious as to their master’s affairs. Now we c an\\ntalk in safety.’ He drew up his chair very close to mine and\\nbegan to stare at me again with the same questioning and\\nthoughtful look.\\n“A feeling of rep ulsion, and of something akin to fear had\\nbegun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshle ss\\nman. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me\\nfrom showing my impatience.\\n“‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said I; ‘my time\\nis of value.’ Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the\\nwords came to my lips.\\n“‘How would fifty guin eas for a night’s work suit you?’ he\\nasked.\\n“‘Mos t admirably.’\\n“‘I say a night’s wo rk, but an hour’s would be nearer the\\nmark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stam ping\\nmachine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is\\nwrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you th ink\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net283\\nof such a commission as that?’\\n“‘The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’ “‘Precisely so. We\\nshall want you to come to-night by the\\nlast train.’\\n“‘Where to ?’\\n“‘To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire,\\nand within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which\\nwould bring you there at about 11:15.’\\n“‘Very good.’\\n“‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’ “‘There is a drive, then?’\\n“‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good\\nseven miles from Eyford Station.’\\n“‘Then we can hardly get there be fore midnight. I suppose\\nthere would be no chance of a train back. I should be com pelled to stop the\\nnight.’\\n“‘Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.’ “‘That is very awkward.\\nCould I not come at some more\\nconvenient hour?’\\n“‘We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to\\nrecompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to\\nyou, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an\\nopinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of cou rse,\\nif you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of\\ntime to do so.’\\n“I thought of th e fifty guineas, and of how very useful they\\nwould be to me. ‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to\\naccommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to\\nunderstand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to\\ndo.’\\n“‘Qu ite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which\\nwe have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity .\\nI have no wish to commit you to anything without your hav ing it all laid\\nbefore you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe\\nfrom eavesdroppers?’\\n“‘Entirely.’\\n“‘Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that\\nfuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in\\none or two places in England?’\\n“‘I have heard so.’\\n“‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very small\\nplace—within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough\\nto discover that there was a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one o f\\nmy fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit\\nwas a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link betw een two very\\nmuch larger ones upon the right and left—\\nboth of them, however, in the grounds of m y neighbours.These\\ngood people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained\\nthat which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it\\nwas to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its\\ntrue value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net285\\ndo this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they\\nsuggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit\\nand that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to\\nbuy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time,\\nand in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This\\npress, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your\\nadvice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if\\nit once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little\\nhouse, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would\\nbe good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our\\nplans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a\\nhuman being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all\\nplain?’\\n“‘I quite follow you,’ said I. ‘The only point which I could not quite\\nunderstand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating\\nfuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.’\\n“‘Ah!’ said he carelessly, ‘we have our own process. We compress the earth\\ninto bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that\\nis a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr.\\nHatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.’ He rose as he spoke. ‘I\\nshall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.’\\n“‘I shall certainly be there.’\\n“‘And not a word to a soul .’ He looked at me with a last long, questioning\\ngaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the\\nroom.\\n“Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much\\nastonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had\\nbeen intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was\\nat least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own\\nservices, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the\\nother hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant\\nimpression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the\\nfuller’s-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at\\nmidnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand.\\nHowever, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to\\nPaddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to\\nholding my tongue.\\n“At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However,\\nI was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit\\nstation after eleven o’clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and\\nthere was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a\\nlantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my\\nacquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side.\\nWithout a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door\\nof which was standing open. He\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net287\\ndrew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away\\nwe went as fast as the horse could go.”\\n“One horse?” interjected Holmes.\\n“Yes, only one.”\\n“Did you observ e the colour?”\\n“Yes, I saw it by the side-ligh ts when I was stepping into the carriage. It\\nwas a chestnut.”\\n“Tired-looking o r fresh?”\\n“Oh, fresh and glossy.”\\n“Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most\\ninteresting statement.”\\n“Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander\\nStark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate\\nthat we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have\\nbeen nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was\\naware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking\\nat me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in\\nthat part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out\\nof the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of\\nfrosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur\\nof a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the\\nmonotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables,\\nand the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the\\nroad was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the\\ncarriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I\\nfollowed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of\\nus. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that\\nI failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The\\ninstant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us,\\nand I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.\\n“It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about lo oking\\nfor matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the\\nother end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our\\ndirection. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand,\\nwhich she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.\\nI could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light\\nshone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a\\nfew words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and\\nwhen my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start\\nthat the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her,\\nwhispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room\\nfrom whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in\\nhis hand.\\n“‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few\\nminutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly\\nfurnished room, with a round table in the\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net289\\ncentre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid\\ndown the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep\\nyou waiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.\\n“I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of\\nGerman I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others\\nbeing volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I\\nmight catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily\\nbarred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was\\nan old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise\\neverything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal\\nover me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living\\nin this strange, outof-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten\\nmiles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east,\\nor west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large\\ntowns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after\\nall. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the\\ncountry. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to\\nkeep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fiftyguinea\\nfee.\\n“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness,\\nthe door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the\\naperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp\\nbeating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she\\nwas sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up\\none shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered\\nwords of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a\\nfrightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\\n“‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; ‘I\\nwould go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.’\\n“‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for.\\nI cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’ “‘It is not worth your\\nwhile to wait,’ she went on. ‘You can\\npass through the door; no one hinders .’ And then, seeing that\\nI smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her\\nconstraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung\\ntogether. ‘For the love of Heaven!’ she whispered, ‘get aw ay\\nfrom here before it is too late!’\\n“But I am somewhat headstron g by nature, and the more\\nready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the\\nway. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journ ey, and of the\\nunpleasant night which seemed to be before\\nme. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away\\nwithout having carried out my commission, and without th e\\npayment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew,\\nbe a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net291\\nmanner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head\\nand declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to\\nrenew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of\\nseveral footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant,\\nthrew up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and\\nas noiselessly as she had come.\\n“The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a\\nchinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was\\nintroduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\\n“‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel. ‘By the way, I was\\nunder the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have\\nfelt the draught.’\\n“‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door myself because I felt the room\\nto be a little close.’\\n“He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘Perhaps we had better proceed\\nto business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the\\nmachine.’\\n“‘I had be tter put my hat on, I suppose.’\\n“‘Oh, no, it is in the house.’\\n“‘What, you dig fuller’s-ear th in the house?’\\n“‘No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we\\nwish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong\\nwith it.’\\n“We we nt upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager\\nand I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors,\\npassages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of\\nwhich were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There\\nwere no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while\\nthe plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in\\ngreen, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as\\npossible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I\\ndisregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions.\\nFerguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the\\nlittle that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.\\n“Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he\\nunlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could\\nhardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered\\nme in.\\n“‘We a re now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be\\na particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The\\nceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and\\nit comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are\\nsmall lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which\\ntransmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The\\nmachine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of\\nit, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to\\nlook it over and to show us how we can set it right.’\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net293\\n“I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It\\nwas indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure.\\nWhen I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which\\ncontrolled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight\\nleakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side\\ncylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which\\nwas round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the\\nsocket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of\\npower, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks\\nvery carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should\\nproceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the\\nmain chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own\\ncuriosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was\\nthe merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an\\nengine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of\\nwood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to\\nexamine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped\\nand was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered\\nexclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking\\ndown at me.\\n“‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.\\n“I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he\\nhad told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’searth,’ said I; ‘I think that I should\\nbe better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact\\npurpose was for which it was used.’\\n“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech.\\nHis face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\\n“‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’ He took a\\nstep backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I\\nrushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did\\nnot give in the least to my kicks and shoves. ‘Hullo!’ I yelled. ‘Hullo!\\nColonel! Let me out!’\\n“And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into\\nmy mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking\\ncylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor\\nwhere I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the\\nblack ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew\\nbetter than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a\\nshapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged\\nwith my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the\\nremorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only\\na foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its\\nhard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net295\\nthe pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I\\nmet it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I\\nshuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and\\nyet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering\\ndown upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught\\nsomething which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\\n“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of\\nwood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow\\nlight between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small\\npanel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here\\nwas indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw\\nmyself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had\\nclosed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments\\nafterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had\\nbeen my escape.\\n“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found\\nmyself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent\\nover me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her\\nright. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly\\nrejected.\\n“‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They will be here in a moment.\\nThey will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time,\\nbut come!’\\n“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and\\nran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to\\nanother broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of\\nrunning feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from\\nthe floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped\\nand looked about her like one who is at her wit’s end. Then she threw open\\na door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon\\nwas shining brightly.\\n“‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high, but it may be that you can\\njump it.’\\n“As she s poke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and\\nI saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a\\nlantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s cleaver in the other. I\\nrushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How\\nquiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it\\ncould not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I\\nhesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour\\nand the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was\\ndetermined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed\\nthrough my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but\\nshe threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\\n“‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember your prom\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net297 ise after the last time. You sai d it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh,\\nhe will be silent!’\\n“‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her. ‘You\\nwill be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!’ He dashed\\nher to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy\\nweapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when\\nhis blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell\\ninto the garden below.\\n“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off\\namong the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far\\nfrom being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly\\ndizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which\\nwas throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had\\nbeen cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured\\nto tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my\\nears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.\\n“How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very\\nlong time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when\\nI came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve\\nwas drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it\\nrecalled in an instant all the particulars of my night’s adventure, and I\\nsprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my\\npursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither\\nhouse nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge\\nclose by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building,\\nwhich proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had\\narrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my\\nhand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an\\nevil dream.\\n“Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.\\nThere would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was\\non duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him\\nwhether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was\\nstrange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me?\\nNo, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one\\nabout three miles off.\\n“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until\\nI got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past\\nsix when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the\\ndoctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your\\nhands and shall do exactly what you advise.”\\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this\\nextraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf\\none of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net299\\n“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he. “It appeared in\\nall the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: ‘Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr.\\nJeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings\\nat ten o’clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,’\\netc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have\\nhis machine overhauled, I fancy.”\\n“Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that explains what the girl said.”\\n“Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperat e\\nman, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way\\nof his little game, like those outand-out pirates who will leave no survivor\\nfrom a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel\\nequal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to\\nstarting for Eyford.”\\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound\\nfrom Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes,\\nthe hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plainclothes\\nman, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the\\ncounty out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle\\nwith Eyford for its centre.\\n“There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from\\nthe village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said\\nten miles, I think, sir.” “It was an hour’s good drive.”\\n“And you think that they brought you back all tha t way when you were\\nunconscious?”\\n“They must ha ve done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been\\nlifted and conveyed somewhere.”\\n“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have spared you\\nwhen they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was\\nsoftened by the woman’s entreaties.”\\n“I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life.”\\n“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet. “Well, I have draw n\\nmy circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are\\nin search of are to be found.”\\n“I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes quietly.\\n“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed yo ur opinion! Come,\\nnow, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is\\nmore deserted there.”\\n“And I say east,” said my patient.\\n“I am for west,” remarked the pl ain-clothes man. “There are several quiet\\nlittle villages up there.”\\n“And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hills there, and our\\nfriend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.”\\n“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very p retty diversity of\\nopinion. We have boxed the compass among us.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net301\\nWho do you give your casting vote to?”\\n“You are all wrong.”\\n“But we can’t all be.”\\n“Oh, yes, you can. Th is is my point.” He placed his finger\\nin the centre of the circle. “This is where we shall find them.” “But the\\ntwelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley. “Six out and six back. Nothing\\nsimpler. You say yourself\\nthat the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if\\nit had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?” “Indeed, it is a likely ruse\\nenough,” observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. “Of course there can be no\\ndoubt as to the nature of this gang.”\\n“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large scale, and have\\nused the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.”\\n“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the\\ninspector. “They have been turning out halfcrowns by the thousand. We\\neven traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had\\ncovered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But\\nnow, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right\\nenough.”\\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall\\ninto the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic\\ncolumn of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in\\nthe neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the\\nlandscape.\\n“A house on fire?” asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its\\nway.\\n“Yes , sir!” said the station-master.\\n“When did it break out?”\\n“I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole\\nplace is in a blaze.”\\n“Whose house is it? ”\\n“Dr. Becher’s.”\\n“Tell me,” brok e in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a\\nlong, sharp nose?”\\nThe station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman,\\nand there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he\\nhas a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a\\nforeigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no\\nharm.”\\nThe sta tion-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening\\nin the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great\\nwidespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every\\nchink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were\\nvainly striving to keep the flames under.\\n“That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. “There is the graveldrive,\\nand there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the\\none that I jumped from.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net303\\n“Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge upon them.\\nThere can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was\\ncrushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they\\nwere too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep\\nyour eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very\\nmuch fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.”\\nAnd Holmes’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word\\nhas ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or\\nthe morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart\\ncontaining several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the\\ndirection of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and\\neven Holmes’ ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their\\nwhereabouts.\\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which\\nthey had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed\\nhuman thumb upon a windowsill of the second floor. About sunset,\\nhowever, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames,\\nbut not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to\\nsuch absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a\\ntrace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate\\nacquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered\\nstored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have\\nexplained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already\\nreferred to.\\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot\\nwhere he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were\\nit not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently\\nbeen carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet\\nand the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that\\nthe silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his\\ncompanion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the\\nway of danger.\\n“Well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more\\nto London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I\\nhave lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”\\n“Experience,” said Holmes, laughing. “Indirectly it may be of value, you\\nknow; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being\\nexcellent company for the remainder of your existence.”\\n10.\\nThe Adventure of the Noble Bachelor.\\nThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased\\nto be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate\\nbridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant\\ndetails have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I\\nhave reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed\\nto the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable\\nshare in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be\\ncomplete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.\\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was\\nstill sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an\\nafternoon stroll to find a\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net305\\nletter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the\\nweather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the\\nJezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my\\nAfghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one\\neasychair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud\\nof newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them\\nall aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the\\nenvelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble\\ncorrespondent could be.\\n“Here is a very fashionable epistle,” I remarked as he entered. “Your\\nmorning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tidewaiter.”\\n“Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” he answered,\\nsmiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like\\none of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to\\nbe bored or to lie.”\\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\\n“Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.”\\n“Not social, then?”\\n“No, distinctly prof essional.”\\n“And from a noble client?”\\n“One of the highest in Engl and.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net307\\n“My dear fellow, I congratulate you.”\\n“I assure you, Watson, without affect ation, that the status of my client is a\\nmatter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible,\\nhowever, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You\\nhave been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?”\\n“It looks like it,” said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. “I\\nhave had nothing else to do.”\\n“It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing\\nexcept the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always\\ninstructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have\\nread about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?”\\n“Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.”\\n“That is well. The letter which I hol d in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I\\nwill read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me\\nhave whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:\\n“‘MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:—Lord Backw ater tells me that\\nI may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have\\ndetermined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to\\nthe very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding.\\nMr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he\\nassures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even\\nthinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o’clock in the\\nafternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope\\nthat you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours\\nfaithfully, ST. SIMON.’\\n“It is dated from Grosv enor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the\\nnoble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side\\nof his right little finger,” remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.\\n“He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.”\\n“Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon th e subject.\\nTurn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while\\nI take a glance as to who our client is.” He picked a red-covered volume\\nfrom a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. “Here he is,” said\\nhe, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. “‘Lord Robert\\nWalsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.’\\nHum! ‘Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.’\\nHe’s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was UnderSecretary\\nfor the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was\\nat one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by\\ndirect descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very\\ninstructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something\\nmore solid.”\\n“I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,” said I,\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net309\\n“for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I\\nfeared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on\\nhand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.”\\n“Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.\\nThat is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the first.\\nPray give me the results of your newspaper selections.”\\n“Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the\\nMorning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: ‘A marriage has\\nbeen arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take\\nplace, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral,\\nand Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San\\nFrancisco, Cal., U.S.A.’ That is all.”\\n“Terse and to the point,” remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs\\ntowards the fire.\\n“There was a pa ragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the\\nsame week. Ah, here it is: ‘There will soon be a call for protection in the\\nmarriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily\\nagainst our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses\\nof Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the\\nAtlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the\\nlist of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders.\\nLord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against\\nthe little god’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching\\nmarriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California\\nmillionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted\\nmuch attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is\\ncurrently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six\\nfigures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the\\nDuke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few\\nyears, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small\\nestate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only\\ngainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common\\ntransition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.’”\\n“Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning.\\n“Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another not e in the Morning Post to say that\\nthe marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St.\\nGeorge’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be\\ninvited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster\\nGate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later—that is,\\non Wednesday last—there is a curt announcement that the wedding had\\ntaken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater’s\\nplace, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the\\ndisappearance of the bride.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net311\\n“Before the what?” asked Holmes with a start. “The vanishing of the lady.”\\n“When did she vanish, then?”\\n“At the wedding breakfast.”\\n“Indeed. This is more interes ting than it promised to be;\\nquite dramatic, in fact.”\\n“Yes; it struck me as be ing a little out of the common.” “They often vanish\\nbefore the ceremony, and occasionally\\nduring the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt\\nas this. Pray let me have the details.” “I warn you that they are very\\nincomplete.”\\n“Perhaps we may make them less so.”\\n“Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of\\nyesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, ‘Singular Occurrence at a\\nFashionable Wedding’:\\n“‘The family of Lord R obert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest\\nconsternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in\\nconnection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the\\npapers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now\\nthat it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so\\npersistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the\\nmatter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good\\npurpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject\\nfor conversation.\\n“‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s, Hanover Square,\\nwas a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr.\\nAloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace\\nand Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the\\nbridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded\\nafterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where\\nbreakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused\\nby a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to\\nforce her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had\\nsome claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged\\nscene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who\\nhad fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had\\nsat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden\\nindisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused\\nsome comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she\\nhad only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and\\nbonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that\\nhe had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit\\nthat it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On\\nascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in\\nconjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in\\ncommunication with the police, and very energetic inquiries\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net313\\nare being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this\\nvery singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had\\ntranspired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of\\nfoul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of\\nthe woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from\\njealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange\\ndisappearance of the bride.’”\\n“And is that all?”\\n“Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive\\none.”\\n“And it is—”\\n“That Miss F lora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has\\nactually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the\\nAllegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are\\nno further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now—so far as it\\nhas been set forth in the public press.”\\n“And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have\\nmissed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock\\nmakes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be\\nour noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer\\nhaving a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.”\\n“Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throw ing open the door.\\nA gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale,\\nwith something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady,\\nwell-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command\\nand to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance\\ngave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a\\nlittle bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very\\ncurly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As\\nto his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar,\\nblack frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and\\nlight-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head\\nfrom left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his\\ngolden eyeglasses. “Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising and\\nbowing. “Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr.\\nWatson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”\\n“A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine , Mr.\\nHolmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already\\nmanaged several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they\\nwere hardly from the same class of society.”\\n“No, I am descending.”\\n“I beg pardon.”\\n“My last client of the sort was a king.”\\n“Oh, really! I had no idea. And which k ing?”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net315\\n“The King of Scandinavia.”\\n“What! Had he lost his wife ?”\\n“You can understand,” said Ho lmes suavely, “that I extend\\nto the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in\\nyours.”\\n“Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my own\\ncase, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in\\nforming an opinion.”\\n“Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing\\nmore. I presume that I may take it as correct— this article, for example, as\\nto the disappearance of the bride.”\\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.”\\n“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an\\nopinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning\\nyou.”\\n“Pray do so.”\\n“When did yo u first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”\\n“In San Francisco, a year ago.”\\n“You were travelling in the Stat es?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Did y ou become engaged then?”\\n“No.”\\n“But y ou were on a friendly footing?”\\n“I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”\\n“Her father is very rich?”\\n“He is said to be the rich est man on the Pacific slope.” “And how did he\\nmake his money?”\\n“In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested\\nit, and came up by leaps and bounds.”\\n“Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s— your wife’s\\ncharacter?”\\nThe noblem an swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire.\\n“You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before her father\\nbecame a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and\\nwandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come\\nfrom Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in\\nEngland a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any\\nsort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say. She is\\nswift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On\\nthe other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the\\nhonour to bear”—he gave a little stately cough—”had not I thought her to\\nbe at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic selfsacrifice\\nand that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.”\\n“Have you her photograph?”\\n“I brought this with me.” He opened a locket and showed us the full face of\\na very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and\\nthe artist had brought out\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net317\\nthe full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the\\nexquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the\\nlocket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\\n“The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your\\nacquaintance?”\\n“Yes, her fathe r brought her over for this last London season. I met her\\nseveral times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.”\\n“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”\\n“A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.”\\n“And this, of course, remains to you, since the marria ge is a fait accompli?”\\n“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”\\n“Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Dora n on the day before the\\nwedding?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Was s he in good spirits?”\\n“Never better. She kept talk ing of what we should do in our future lives.”\\n“Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?”\\n“She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony.”\\n“And did you observe any change in her then?”\\n“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her\\ntemper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate\\nand can have no possible bearing upon the case.”\\n“Pray let us have it, for all that.”\\n“Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry.\\nShe was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew.\\nThere was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to\\nher again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I\\nspoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage,\\non our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.”\\n“Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the\\ngeneral public were present, then?”\\n“Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.”\\n“This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”\\n“No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a commonlooking\\nperson. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we\\nare wandering rather far from the point.”\\n“Lady St. Simon, then, returned from th e wedding in a less cheerful frame\\nof mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father’s\\nhouse?”\\n“I saw h er in conversation with her maid.”\\n“And who is her maid?”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net319 “Alice is her name. She is an American and came from\\nCalifornia with her.”\\n“A confidential serva nt?”\\n“A little too much so. It se emed to me that her mistress\\nallowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look\\nupon these things in a different way.”\\n“How long did she speak to this Alice ?”\\n“Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.” “You did not\\noverhear what they said?”\\n“Lady St. Simon said som ething about ‘jumping a claim.’\\nShe was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she\\nmeant.”\\n“American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do\\nwhen she finished speaking to her maid?”\\n“She walked into the breakfast-room.”\\n“On your arm?”\\n“No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after\\nwe had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some\\nwords of apology, and left the room. She never came back.”\\n“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she we nt to her room,\\ncovered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.”\\n“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in\\ncompany with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had\\nalready made a disturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.”\\n“Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lad y, and your\\nrelations to her.”\\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We have\\nbeen on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a very friendly\\nfooting. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously,\\nand she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what\\nwomen are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly\\nhotheaded and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters\\nwhen she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the\\nreason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest\\nthere might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran’s door just\\nafter we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very\\nabusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had\\nforeseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police\\nfellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was\\nquiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.”\\n“Did your wife hear all this?”\\n“No, thank goodness, she did not.”\\n“And she was seen walking with th is very woman afterwards?”\\n“Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon a s so serious.\\nIt is thought that Flora decoyed my wife\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net321\\nout and laid some terrible trap for her.”\\n“Well, it is a possible supposition.”\\n“You think so, too?”\\n“I did not say a prob able one. But you do not yourself look\\nupon this as likely?”\\n“I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”\\n“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray\\nwhat is your own theory as to what took place?”\\n“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to prop ound one.\\nI have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may\\nsay that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement\\nof this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immens e\\na social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous\\ndisturbance in my wife.”\\n“In short, that she had b ecome suddenly deranged?” “Well, really, when I\\nconsider that she has turned her back—\\nI will not say upon me, but upon so muc h that many have\\naspired to without success—I can hardly explain it in any other\\nfashion.”\\n“Well, ce rtainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said\\nHolmes, smiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I\\nhave nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seate d at\\nthe breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?” “ We could see\\nthe other side of the road and the Park.” “Quite so. Then I do not think that I\\nneed to detain you\\nlonger. I shall com municate with you.”\\n“Should you be fortunate enough to sol ve this problem,”\\nsaid our client, rising.\\n“I have solved it.”\\n“Eh? What was tha t?”\\n“I say that I have solve d it.”\\n“Where, then, is my wife?”\\n“That is a detail which I sh all speedily supply.” Lord St. Simon shook his\\nhead. “I am afraid that it will\\ntake wiser heads than yours o r mine,” he remarked, and bowing in a stately,\\nold-fashioned manner he departed. “It is very good of Lord St. Simon to\\nhonour my head by\\nputting it on a level with his own,” said Sherlock Holmes,\\nlaughing. “I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a\\ncigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conc lusions as to the\\ncase before our client came into the room.” “My dear Holmes!”\\n“I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I\\nremarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination\\nserved to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is\\noccasionally very convincing, as when\\nyou find a trout in the milk, to quote Th oreau’s example.” “But I have heard\\nall that you have heard.”\\n“Without, however, the k nowledge of pre-existing cases\\nwhich serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some\\nyears back, and something on very much the same\\nlines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net323\\none of these cases—but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade!\\nYou will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in\\nthe box.”\\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him\\na decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his\\nhand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had\\nbeen offered to him.\\n“What’s up, then?” asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. “You look\\ndissatisfied.”\\n“And I feel d issatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can\\nmake neither head nor tail of the business.”\\n“Really! You surprise me.”\\n“Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through\\nmy fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.”\\n“And very wet it seems to have made you,” sa id Holmes laying his hand\\nupon the arm of the pea-jacket.\\n“Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.”\\n“In heaven’s name, what for?”\\n“In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.”\\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair a nd laughed heartily.\\n“Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?” he asked.\\n“Why? What do you mean?”\\n“Because you have just as go od a chance of finding this lady in the one as\\nin the other.”\\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. “I suppose you know all\\nabout it,” he snarled.\\n“Well, I have only ju st heard the facts, but my mind is made up.”\\n“Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no p art in the\\nmatter?”\\n“I think i t very unlikely.”\\n“Then perhaps you will k indly explain how it is that we found this in it?”\\nHe opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress\\nof watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride’s wreath and veil, all\\ndiscoloured and soaked in water. “There,” said he, putting a new weddingring\\nupon the top of the pile. “There is a little nut for you to crack, Master\\nHolmes.”\\n“Oh, inde ed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. “You dragged\\nthem from the Serpentine?”\\n“No. They were found float ing near the margin by a parkkeeper. They have\\nbeen identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were\\nthere the body would not be far off.”\\n“By the same brilliant reasoning, ev ery man’s body is to be found in the\\nneighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at\\nthrough this?”\\n“At some evid ence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net325\\n“I am afraid that you will find it difficult.”\\n“Are you, indeed, now?” cried Lestrade w ith some bitterness. “I am afraid,\\nHolmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your\\ninferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress\\ndoes implicate Miss Flora Millar.”\\n“And how?”\\n“In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a\\nnote. And here is the very note.” He slapped it down upon the table in front\\nof him. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when all is ready. Come at once.\\nF.H.M.’ Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was\\ndecoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt,\\nwas responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the\\nvery note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and\\nwhich lured her within their reach.”\\n“Very good, Lestrade,” said Holm es, laughing. “You really are very fine\\nindeed. Let me see it.” He took up the paper in a listless way, but his\\nattention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction.\\n“This is indeed important,” said he.\\n“Ha! you find it so?”\\n“Extremely so. I cong ratulate you warmly.”\\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his he ad to look. “Why,” he shrieked,\\n“you’re looking at the wrong side!”\\n“On the contrary, this is the right sid e.”\\n“The right side? You’re mad! Here is th e note written in pencil over here.”\\n“And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, whic h\\ninterests me deeply.”\\n“There’s nothing in it. I looked at it before,” said Lestrade. “‘Oct. 4th,\\nrooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.’ I\\nsee nothing in that.”\\n“Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is\\nimportant also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.”\\n“I’ve wasted time enough,” said Lestrade, rising. “I believe in hard work\\nand not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes,\\nand we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.” He gathered\\nup the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.\\n“Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes before his riva l vanished;\\n“I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth.\\nThere is not, and there never has been, any such person.”\\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his\\nforehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his\\novercoat. “There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,”\\nhe remarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a\\nlittle.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net327\\nIt was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time\\nto be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s man with a\\nvery large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had\\nbrought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite\\nepicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble\\nlodginghouse mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a\\npheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby\\nbottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away,\\nlike the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the\\nthings had been paid for and were ordered to this address.\\nJust before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.\\nHis features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made\\nme think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\\n“They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands. “You seem to\\nexpect company. They have laid for five.” “Yes, I fancy we may have some\\ncompany dropping in,”\\nsaid he. “I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I\\nfancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.” It was indeed our visitor of\\nthe afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously\\nthan ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic\\nfeatures. “My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.\\n“Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you\\ngood authority for what you say?” “The best possible.”\\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand ov er\\nhis forehead.\\n“What will th e Duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears\\nthat one of the family has been subjected to such humiliat ion?”\\n“It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any\\nhumiliation.”\\n“Ah, you loo k on these things from another standpoint.” “I fail to see that\\nanyone is to blame. I can hardly see how\\nthe lady could have acted otherwise, thou gh her abrupt method\\nof doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother,\\nshe had no one to advise her at such a crisis.”\\n“It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon,\\ntapping his fingers upon the table.\\n“You must make allowance for thi s poor girl, placed in so\\nunprecedented a position.”\\n“I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I\\nhave been shamefully used.”\\n“I think that I heard a ring,” s aid Holmes. “Yes, there are\\nsteps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a le nient\\nview of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advoc ate here who\\nmay be more successful.” He opened the door\\nand ushered in a lady and gentleman. “Lord St . Simon,” said\\nhe “allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net329 Moulton. The lady, I think, yo u have already met.”\\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and\\nstood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast\\nof his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick\\nstep forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise\\nhis eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was\\none which it was hard to resist.\\n“You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess you have every cause to\\nbe.”\\n“Pra y make no apology to me,” said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\\n“Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and tha t I should have\\nspoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time\\nwhen I saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was doing or saying.\\nI only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.”\\n“Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave th e\\nroom while you explain this matter?”\\n“If I may give an opinion,” remarke d the strange gentleman, “we’ve had\\njust a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I\\nshould like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.” He was a small,\\nwiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.\\n“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady. “Frank here and I met in\\n’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where pa was working a claim.\\nWe were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck\\na rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that\\npetered out and came to nothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank;\\nso at last pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he\\ntook me away to ‘Frisco. Frank wouldn’t throw up his hand, though; so he\\nfollowed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it. It\\nwould only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for\\nourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never\\ncome back to claim me until he had as much as pa. So then I promised to\\nwait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else\\nwhile he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be married right away, then,’ said he,\\n‘and then I will feel sure of you; and I won’t claim to be your husband until\\nI come back?’ Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely,\\nwith a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and\\nthen Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa.\\n“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went\\nprospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After\\nthat came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been\\nattacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the\\nkilled. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought\\nI had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ‘Frisco. Not a\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net331\\nword of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank\\nwas really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to ‘Frisco, and we came to\\nLondon, and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt all\\nthe time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that\\nhad been given to my poor Frank.\\n“Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my duty by\\nhim. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar\\nwith him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me\\nto be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar\\nrails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the\\nfirst pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he\\nwas still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were\\nglad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was\\nturning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a\\nbee in my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make\\na scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what\\nI was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then\\nI saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a\\nnote. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to\\nhim, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers.\\nIt was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do\\nso. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to\\nhim, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.\\n“When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and\\nhad always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few\\nthings packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord\\nSt. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great\\npeople. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I\\nhadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at\\nthe other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into\\nthe Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman\\ncame talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me—seemed to\\nme from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before\\nmarriage also—but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook\\nFrank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he\\nhad taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those\\nyears of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had\\nescaped, came on to ‘Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had\\ngone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the\\nvery morning of my second wedding.”\\n“I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It gave the name and the\\nchurch but not where the lady lived.”\\n“Then we had a talk as to what w e should do, and Frank was all for\\nopenness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net333\\nif I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again— just\\nsending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to\\nme to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table\\nand waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and\\nthings and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and\\ndropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely\\nthat we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good\\ngentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he\\nfound us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly\\nthat I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting\\nourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a\\nchance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away\\nround to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am\\nvery sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very\\nmeanly of me.”\\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened\\nwith a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.\\n“Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate\\npersonal affairs in this public manner.”\\n“Then you won’t forgive me? You won ’t shake hands before I go?”\\n“Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” He put out his h and and\\ncoldly grasped that which she extended to him.\\n“I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you would have joined us in a\\nfriendly supper.”\\n“I think that ther e you ask a little too much,” responded his Lordship. “I\\nmay be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly\\nbe expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I\\nwill now wish you all a very good-night.” He included us all in a sweeping\\nbow and stalked out of the room.\\n“Then I trust that you at least w ill honour me with your company,” said\\nSherlock Holmes. “It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for\\nI am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the\\nblundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from\\nbeing some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which\\nshall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.”\\n“The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes when ou r visitors\\nhad left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how simple the\\nexplanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost\\ninexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as\\nnarrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for\\ninstance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.”\\n“You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”\\n“From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net335\\nthat the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the\\nother that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.\\nObviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to\\nchange her mind. What could that something be? She could not have\\nspoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the\\nbridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone\\nfrom America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she\\ncould hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her\\nthat the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so\\ncompletely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at\\nthe idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this\\nAmerican be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It\\nmight be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I\\nknew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had\\ngot before I ever heard Lord St. Simon’s narrative. When he told us of a\\nman in a pew, of the change in the bride’s manner, of so transparent a\\ndevice for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her\\nconfidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—\\nwhich in miners’ parlance means taking possession of that which another\\nperson has a prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear.\\nShe had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a\\nprevious husband—the chances being in favour of the latter.”\\n“And how in the world did you find them?”\\n“It might have been difficult, but friend L estrade held information in his\\nhands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of\\ncourse, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know\\nthat within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London\\nhotels.”\\n“How d id you deduce the select?”\\n“By the select prices. Eight shillin gs for a bed and eightpence for a glass of\\nsherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in\\nLondon which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in\\nNorthumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis\\nH. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on\\nlooking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I\\nhad seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226\\nGordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the\\nloving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to\\npoint out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make\\ntheir position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St.\\nSimon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I\\nmade him keep the appointment.”\\n“But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His conduct was certainly not\\nvery gracious.”\\n“Ah, Watson,” s aid Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net337\\nnot be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding,\\nyou found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that\\nwe may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we\\nare never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up\\nand hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how\\nto while away these bleak autumnal evenings.”\\n11.\\nThe Adventure of the Beryl Coronet.\\n“Holmes,” said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down\\nthe street, “here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his\\nrelatives should allow him to come out alone.”\\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the\\npockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright,\\ncrisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon\\nthe ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of\\nBaker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic,\\nbut at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as\\nwhite as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but\\nwas still dangerously slip\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net339\\npery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the\\ndirection of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single\\ngentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive,\\nstrongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a\\nsombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters,\\nand well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to\\nthe dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with\\noccasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed\\nto set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down,\\nwaggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary\\ncontortions.\\n“What on earth can be the matter with him?” I asked. “He is looking up at\\nthe numbers of the houses.”\\n“I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\\n“Here?”\\n“Yes; I r ather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I\\nrecognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?” As he spoke, the man,\\npuffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the\\nwhole house resounded with the clanging.\\nA few moments later he was in our room , still puffing, still gesticulating,\\nbut with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were\\nturned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his\\nwords out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has\\nbeen driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to\\nhis feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both\\nrushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock\\nHolmes pushed him down into the easychair and, sitting beside him, patted\\nhis hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so\\nwell how to employ.\\n“You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?” said he. “You are\\nfatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and\\nthen I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may\\nsubmit to me.”\\nThe man sat fo r a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his\\nemotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight,\\nand turned his face towards us.\\n“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.\\n“I see that you have had some great trou ble,” responded Holmes.\\n“God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so\\nsudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I\\nam a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction\\nalso is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful\\na form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net341 alone. The very noblest in th e land may suffer unless some way be found\\nout of this horrible affair.”\\n“Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have a clear account\\nof who you are and what it is that has befallen you.”\\n“My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to your ears. I am\\nAlexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of\\nThreadneedle Street.”\\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in\\nthe second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What\\ncould have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London\\nto this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort\\nhe braced himself to tell his story.\\n“I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I hastened here when the\\npolice inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to\\nBaker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the\\ncabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I\\nam a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the\\nfacts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\\n“It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as\\nmuch depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our\\nfunds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our\\ndepositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the\\nshape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good\\ndeal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble\\nfamilies to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their\\npictures, libraries, or plate.\\n“Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was\\nbrought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it\\nwas that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I had better say no\\nmore than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth—\\none of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was\\noverwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but\\nhe plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry\\nquickly through a disagreeable task.\\n“‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed that you are in the habit of\\nadvancing money.’\\n“‘The firm does so when the security is good.’ I answered.\\n“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I sho uld have 50,000\\npounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over\\nfrom my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to\\ncarry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand\\nthat it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’\\n“‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I a sked.\\n“‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most\\ncertainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right\\nto charge. But it is very essential to\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net343\\nme that the money should be paid at once.’\\n“‘I should be happy to advance it without fu rther parley\\nfrom my own private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain\\nwould be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand,\\nI am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my\\npartner I must insist that, even in your case, every busines slike\\nprecaution should be taken.’\\n“‘I should much prefer to ha ve it so,’ said he, raising up a\\nsquare, black morocco case which he had laid beside his c hair.\\n‘You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’ “‘One of the most\\nprecious public possessions of the empire,’ said I.\\n“‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbed ded in\\nsoft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery\\nwhich he had named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’\\nsaid he, ‘and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The\\nlowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double\\nthe sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with yo u\\nas my security.’\\n“I took the preci ous case into my hands and looked in some\\nperplexity from it to my illustrious client.\\n“‘You doubt its value?’ he asked.\\n“‘Not at all. I only doubt—’\\n“‘The propriety of my leavin g it. You may set your mind at\\nrest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not\\nabsolutely certain that I should be able in four days to recl aim\\nit. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?’ “‘Am ple.’\\n“‘You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong\\nproof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon a ll\\nthat I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discree t\\nand to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to\\npreserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I\\nneed not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any\\nharm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as\\nserious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the w orld\\nto match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I\\nleave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shal l\\ncall for it in person on Monday morning.’\\n“Seeing that my client was anxious to leav e, I said no more\\nbut, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1 000\\npound notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the\\nprecious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not\\nbut think with some misgivings of the immense responsibilit y\\nwhich it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it\\nwas a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if\\nany misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having\\never consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to\\nalter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and\\nturned once more to my work.\\n“When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence\\nto leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Banke rs’\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net345\\nsafes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how\\nterrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined,\\ntherefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case\\nbackward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my\\nreach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at\\nStreatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had\\ntaken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressingroom.\\n“And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to\\nthoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of\\nthe house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who\\nhave been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite\\nabove suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only\\nbeen in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character,\\nhowever, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and\\nhas attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is\\nthe only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a\\nthoroughly good girl in every way.\\n“So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take\\nme long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has\\nbeen a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous disappointment. I\\nhave no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled\\nhim. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had\\nto love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his\\nface. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for\\nboth of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\\n“It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business,\\nbut he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the\\ntruth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he\\nwas young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having\\ncharming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long\\npurses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to\\nsquander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and\\nimplore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle\\nhis debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the\\ndangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of\\nhis friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\\n“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell\\nshould gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my\\nhouse, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of\\nhis manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips,\\none who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man\\nof great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net347\\ncold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced\\nfrom his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he\\nis one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my\\nlittle Mary, who has a woman’s quick insight into character.\\n“And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my\\nbrother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and\\nhave looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my\\nhouse—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet\\nas tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I\\ndo not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever\\ngone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he\\nloves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if\\nanyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she,\\nand that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is\\ntoo late—forever too late!\\n“Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I\\nshall continue with my miserable story.\\n“When we were taking coffee in the dr awing-room that night after dinner, I\\ntold Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we\\nhad under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who\\nhad brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear\\nthat the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished\\nto see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\\n“‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.\\n“‘In my own bureau.’\\n“‘Well, I hope to goo dness the house won’t be burgled during the night.’\\nsaid he.\\n“‘It is lo cked up,’ I answered.\\n“‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have\\nopened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’\\n“He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought littl e of what he said.\\nHe followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\\n“‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me h ave\\n200 pounds?’\\n“‘No, I canno t!’ I answered sharply. ‘I have been far too generous with you\\nin money matters.’\\n“‘You have been v ery kind,’ said he, ‘but I must have this money, or else I\\ncan never show my face inside the club again.’\\n“‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.\\n“‘Yes, but you would not have me lea ve it a dishonoured man,’ said he. ‘I\\ncould not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you\\nwill not let me have it, then I must try other means.’\\n“I was very angry, for this was the third demand d uring the month. ‘You\\nshall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net349\\nwhich he bowed and left the room without another word. “When he was\\ngone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that\\nmy treasure was safe, and locked it again. T hen I started to go\\nround the house to see that all was secure—a duty which I\\nusually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perfor m\\nmyself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary he rself at the side\\nwindow of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\\n“‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, ‘did you give\\nLucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’ “‘Certainly not.’\\n“‘She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt\\nthat she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I\\nthink that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.’ “‘You m ust speak to her\\nin the morning, or I will if you\\nprefer it. Are you sure that eve rything is fastened?’ “‘Quite sure, dad.’\\n“‘Then, good-night.’ I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, w here\\nI was soon asleep.\\n“I am endeavourin g to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes,\\nwhich may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg tha t you\\nwill question me upon any point which I do not make cl ear.” “On the\\ncontrary, your statement is singularly lucid.” “I come to a part of my story\\nnow in which I should wish to\\nbe particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my\\nmind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in\\nthe morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had\\nceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as\\nthough a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my\\nears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving\\nsoftly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and\\npeeped round the corner of my dressing\\nroom door.\\n“‘Arthur!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief! How dare you\\ntouch that coronet?’\\n“The gas was half up , as I had left it, and my unhappy boy,\\ndressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside t he\\nlight, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be\\nwrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry\\nhe dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I\\nsnatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, w ith\\nthree of the beryls in it, was missing.\\n“‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with rage. ‘You\\nhave destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where\\nare the jewels which you have stolen?’\\n“‘Stolen!’ he cried.\\n“‘Yes, thief!’ I roa red, shaking him by the shoulder. “‘There are none\\nmissing. There cannot be any missing,’\\nsaid he.\\n“‘There are three missing. And you know where they are.\\nMust I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net351\\nto tear off another piece?’\\n“‘You have called me nam es enough,’ said he, ‘I will not\\nstand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this\\nbusiness, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave y our\\nhouse in the morning and make my own way in the world. ’ “‘You shall\\nleave it in the hands of the police!’ I cried halfmad with grief and rage. ‘I\\nshall have this matter probed to the\\nbottom.’\\n“‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he with a passion\\nsuch as I should not have thought was in his nature. ‘If you\\nchoose to call the police, let the police find what they can .’ “By this time\\nthe whole house was astir, for I had raised my\\nvoice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush i nto my room,\\nand, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur’s face, she read\\nthe whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on th e\\nground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the inve stigation into\\ntheir hands at once. When the inspector and a\\nconstable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly\\nwith his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to\\ncharge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a\\nprivate matter, but had become a public one, since the ruine d\\ncoronet was national property. I was determined that the law\\nshould have its way in everything.\\n“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not h ave me arrested at once. It\\nwould be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave t he\\nhouse for five minutes.’\\n“‘That you may get awa y, or perhaps that you may conceal\\nwhat you have stolen,’ said I. And then, realising the dread ful\\nposition in which I was placed, I implored him to remember\\nthat not only my honour but that of one who was far greater\\nthan I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal\\nwhich would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he\\nwould but tell me what he had done with the three missing\\nstones.\\n“‘You m ay as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been\\ncaught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt\\nmore heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in you r\\npower, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgive n\\nand forgotten.’\\n“‘Keep your fo rgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning\\naway from me with a sneer. I saw that he was\\ntoo hardened for any words of mine to influen ce him. There\\nwas but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him\\ninto custody. A search was made at once not only of his perso n\\nbut of his room and of every portion of the house where he\\ncould possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them\\ncould be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth\\nfor all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was\\nremoved to a cell, and I, after going through all the police f ormalities, have\\nhurried round to you to implore you to use your\\nskill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they\\ncan at present make nothing of it. You may go\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net353\\nto any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward\\nof 1000 pounds. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems,\\nand my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!”\\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro,\\ndroning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted\\nand his eyes fixed upon the fire.\\n“Do you receive much company ?” he asked.\\n“None save my partner with his family and a n occasional friend of Arthur’s.\\nSir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else, I think.”\\n“Do you go out much in society?”\\n“Arthur does. Mary and I stay at h ome. We neither of us care for it.”\\n“That is unusual in a young girl.”\\n“She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-andtwenty.”\\n“This ma tter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.”\\n“Terrible! She is even more affected than I.”\\n“You have neither of you any doubt as to you r son’s guilt?”\\n“How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes wi th the coronet in\\nhis hands.”\\n“I hardly co nsider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet\\nat all injured?”\\n“Yes, it was tw isted.”\\n“Do you not think, the n, that he might have been trying to straighten it?”\\n“God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But i t is\\ntoo heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were\\ninnocent, why did he not say so?” “Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did\\nhe not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are\\nseveral singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise\\nwhich awoke you from your sleep?”\\n“They considered that it might be c aused by Arthur’s closing his bedroom\\ndoor.”\\n“A lik ely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to\\nwake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these\\ngems?”\\n“They a re still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope\\nof finding them.”\\n“Have they thoug ht of looking outside the house?” “Yes, they have shown\\nextraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely\\nexamined.”\\n“Now, my dear sir,” said Holmes. “is it not obvious to you now that this\\nmatter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at\\nfirst inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems\\nexceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You sup\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net355\\npose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your\\ndressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by\\nmain force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed\\nthree gems out of the thirtynine, with such skill that nobody can find them,\\nand then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he\\nexposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now,\\nis such a theory tenable?”\\n“But what other is there?” cried the banker with a gesture of despair. “If his\\nmotives were innocent, why does he not explain them?”\\n“It is our task to find that out,” replied Holmes; “so now, if you please, Mr.\\nHolder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to\\nglancing a little more closely into details.”\\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which\\nI was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply\\nstirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the\\nbanker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father,\\nbut still I had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I felt that there must be\\nsome grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted\\nexplanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern\\nsuburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his\\neyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh\\nheart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he\\neven broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short\\nrailway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest\\nresidence of the great financier.\\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a\\nlittle from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,\\nstretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance.\\nOn the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path\\nbetween two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and\\nforming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the\\nstables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though\\nlittle used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked\\nslowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and\\nso round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr.\\nHolder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he\\nshould return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a\\nyoung lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with\\ndark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of\\nher skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a\\nwoman’s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with\\ncrying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater\\nsense of grief than the banker\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net357\\nhad done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was\\nevidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for selfrestraint.\\nDisregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and\\npassed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\\n“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?”\\nshe asked.\\n“No, no, m y girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”\\n“But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woma n’s instincts are.\\nI know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted\\nso harshly.”\\n“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”\\n“Who knows? Perhaps because he was s o angry that you should suspect\\nhim.”\\n“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the\\ncoronet in his hand?”\\n“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for\\nit that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful\\nto think of our dear Arthur in prison!”\\n“I shall never let it drop until the g ems are found—never, Mary! Your\\naffection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far\\nfrom hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London\\nto inquire more deeply into it.”\\n“This gentleman?” she asked, f acing round to me.\\n“No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable\\nlane now.”\\n“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he hope to find\\nthere? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in\\nproving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of\\nthis crime.”\\n“I fully sha re your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,”\\nreturned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes.\\n“I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask\\nyou a question or two?”\\n“Pray do, sir, if it may h elp to clear this horrible affair up.”\\n“You heard nothing yourself last night?”\\n“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I\\ncame down.”\\n“You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the\\nwindows?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Were they all fastened this morning?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“You h ave a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your\\nuncle last night that she had been out to see him?”\\n“Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the draw ing-room, and who may\\nhave heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net359\\n“I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that\\nthe two may have planned the robbery.”\\n“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker\\nimpatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his\\nhands?”\\n“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss\\nHolder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”\\n“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her\\nslipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”\\n“Do you know him?”\\n“Oh, yes! he is the gre en-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His name\\nis Francis Prosper.”\\n“He stood,” said Ho lmes, “to the left of the door—that is to say, farther up\\nthe path than is necessary to reach the door?”\\n“Yes, he did.”\\n“And he is a m an with a wooden leg?”\\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black eyes.\\n“Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you know that?” She\\nsmiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’ thin, eager face.\\n“I should be very glad now to go upstairs,” said he. “I shall probably wish\\nto go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at\\nthe lower windows before I go up.”\\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large\\none which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and\\nmade a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying\\nlens. “Now we shall go upstairs,” said he at last.\\nThe banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furn ished little chamber, with a\\ngrey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau\\nfirst and looked hard at the lock.\\n“Which key was used to open it? ” he asked.\\n“That which my son himself indicated—tha t of the cupboard of the lumberroom.”\\n“Have y ou it here?”\\n“That is it on the dre ssing-table.”\\nSherlock Holmes took it up and o pened the bureau.\\n“It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder t hat it did not wake you.\\nThis case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it.” He\\nopened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a\\nmagnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and the thirty-six stones were\\nthe finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked\\nedge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\\n“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds to\\nthat which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it\\noff.”\\nThe b anker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” said he.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net361\\n“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result.\\n“I feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though I am exceptionally strong in the\\nfingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not\\ndo it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder?\\nThere would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this\\nhappened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?”\\n“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”\\n“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss\\nHolder?”\\n“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”\\n“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you sa w him?”\\n“He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”\\n“Thank you. We have certainly been favoured w ith extraordinary luck\\nduring this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not\\nsucceed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall\\nnow continue my investigations outside.”\\nHe went alone, at his own request, for h e explained that any unnecessary\\nfootmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was\\nat work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as\\ninscrutable as ever.\\n“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,” said he; “I\\ncan serve you best by returning to my rooms.”\\n“But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?” “I cannot tell.”\\nThe banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” h e cried. “And\\nmy son? You give me hopes?”\\n“My opinion is in no way alter ed.”\\n“Then, for God’s sake, what was th is dark business which was acted in my\\nhouse last night?”\\n“If you can call u pon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning\\nbetween nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I\\nunderstand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that\\nI get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.”\\n“I would give my fortune to have them back.”\\n“Very good. I shall look into the matter betwe en this and then. Good-bye; it\\nis just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.”\\nIt was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up ab out\\nthe case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even\\ndimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured\\nto sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other\\ntopic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we\\nfound ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and\\nwas down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his\\ncollar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he\\nwas a perfect sample of\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net363\\nthe class.\\n“I think th at this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass\\nabove the fireplace. “I only wish that you could come with m e,\\nWatson, but I fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this\\nmatter, or I may be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall\\nsoon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few\\nhours.” He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the side board, sandwiched\\nit between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket\\nhe started off upon his expedition.\\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in\\nexcellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand.\\nHe chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup\\nof tea.\\n“I only looked in as I passed,” said he. “I am going right\\non.”\\n“Wh ere to?”\\n“Oh, to the o ther side of the West End. It may be some\\ntime before I get back. Don’t wait up for me in case I s hould be\\nlate.”\\n“How are you getting on?”\\n“Oh, so so. Nothing to com plain of. I have been out to\\nStreatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house.\\nIt is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it\\nfor a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but\\nmust get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly\\nrespectable self.”\\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for\\nsatisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes\\ntwinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow\\ncheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard\\nthe slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once\\nmore upon his congenial hunt.\\nI waited until midnight, but the re was no sign of his return,\\nso I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to\\nbe away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a\\nscent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not kno w\\nat what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast\\nin the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand\\nand the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible. “Y ou will excuse\\nmy beginning without you, Watson,” said\\nhe, “but you remember that our client ha s rather an early appointment this\\nmorning.”\\n“Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should not be\\nsurprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.” It was , indeed, our friend\\nthe financier. I was shocked by\\nthe change which had come ove r him, for his face which was\\nnaturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched an d\\nfallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter.\\nHe entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even mo re\\npainful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped\\nheavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net365\\n“I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he. “Only\\ntwo days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the\\nworld. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes\\nclose upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.”\\n“Deserted you?”\\n“Yes. Her bed th is morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and\\na note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow\\nand not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well\\nwith him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark\\nthat she refers in this note:\\n“‘MY DEAREST UNCLE :—I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,\\nand that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have\\noccurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under\\nyour roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my\\nfuture, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it\\nwill be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever\\nyour loving,—MARY.’\\n“What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to\\nsuicide?”\\n“No, no, n othing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust,\\nMr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.”\\n“Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned\\nsomething! Where are the gems?”\\n“You would not think 1000 pound s apiece an excessive sum for them?”\\n“I would pay ten.”\\n“That would be u nnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And\\nthere is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a pen.\\nBetter make it out for 4000 pounds.”\\nWith a dazed face the banker made o ut the required check. Holmes walked\\nover to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in\\nit, and threw it down upon the table.\\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutch ed it up.\\n“You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am s aved!”\\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief ha d been, and he hugged\\nhis recovered gems to his bosom.\\n“There is one other thing you o we, Mr. Holder,” said Sherlock Holmes\\nrather sternly.\\n“Owe!” He ca ught up a pen. “Name the sum, and I will pay it.”\\n“No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble\\nlad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to\\nsee my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.”\\n“Then it was not Arthur who took them?”\\n“I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.”\\n“You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net367\\nhim know that the truth is known.”\\n“He knows it already. When I had c leared it all up I had an\\ninterview with him, and finding that he would not tell me th e\\nstory, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was\\nright and to add the very few details which were not yet qui te\\nclear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open h is\\nlips.”\\n“For h eaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary\\nmystery!”\\n“I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached\\nit. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me\\nto say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding\\nbetween Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They h ave\\nnow fled together.”\\n“My Mary? Imposs ible!”\\n“It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your\\nson knew the true character of this man\\nwhen you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of\\nthe most dangerous men in England—a ruined gambler, an\\nabsolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscie nce.\\nYour niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his\\nvows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she f lattered herself\\nthat she alone had touched his heart. The devil\\nknows best what he said, but at least she becam e his tool and\\nwas in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.” “I can not, and I will\\nnot, believe it!” cried the banker with\\nan ashen face.\\n“I will tell you , then, what occurred in your house last night.\\nYour niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room ,\\nslipped down and talked to her lover through the window whic h\\nleads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right\\nthrough the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of\\nthe coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and\\nhe bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but\\nthere are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all\\nother loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had\\nhardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming\\ndownstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told\\nyou about one of the servants’ escapade with her wooden-leg ged\\nlover, which was all perfectly true.\\n“Your boy, Arthur, went to bed afte r his interview with you\\nbut he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his clu b\\ndebts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his\\ndoor, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cou sin\\nwalking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared\\ninto your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad\\nslipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see\\nwhat would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerg ed\\nfrom the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your\\nson saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She\\npassed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along\\nand slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he coul d\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net369\\nsee what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window,\\nhand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once\\nmore hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid\\nbehind the curtain.\\n“As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a\\nhorrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she\\nwas gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and\\nhow all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in\\nhis bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down\\nthe lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George\\nBurnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle\\nbetween them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent\\nat the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the\\neye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had\\nthe coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your\\nroom, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the\\nstruggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the\\nscene.”\\n“Is it possible?” gasped the banker.\\n“You then roused his anger by calli ng him names at a moment when he felt\\nthat he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true\\nstate of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough\\nconsideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and\\npreserved her secret.”\\n“And that was why s he shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,”\\ncried Mr. Holder. “Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his\\nasking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to\\nsee if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I\\nhave misjudged him!”\\n“When I arrived at th e house,” continued Holmes, “I at once went very\\ncarefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which\\nmight help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and\\nalso that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed\\nalong the tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down and\\nindistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen\\ndoor, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions\\non one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had\\nbeen disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was\\nshown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a\\nlittle, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the\\nmaid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and\\ninquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing\\nanything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I\\ngot into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the\\nsnow in front of me.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net371\\n“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\\nline which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at\\nonce convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The\\nfirst had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread\\nwas marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he\\nhad passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall\\nwindow, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I\\nwalked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane.\\nI saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though\\nthere had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had\\nfallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the\\nlane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had\\nbeen hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the\\npavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.\\n“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and\\nframework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that\\nsomeone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where\\nthe wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able\\nto form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the\\nwindow; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by\\nyour son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each\\ntugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither\\nalone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a\\nfragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now\\nwas, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?\\n“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,\\nwhatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that\\nit was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece\\nand the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself\\nto be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved\\nhis cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should\\nretain her secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I\\nremembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted\\non seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\\n“And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who\\nelse could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I\\nknew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very\\nlimited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him\\nbefore as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been\\nhe who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he\\nknew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he\\nwas safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own\\nfamily.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net373\\n“Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went\\nin the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick up an\\nacquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the\\nnight before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by\\nbuying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to\\nStreatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.”\\n“I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” said Mr.\\nHolder.\\n“Precise ly. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and\\nchanged my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I\\nsaw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so\\nastute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and\\nsaw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him\\nevery particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a lifepreserver\\nfrom the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to\\nhis head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I\\ntold him that we would give him a price for the stones he held—1000\\npounds apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown.\\n‘Why, dash it all!’ said he, ‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I\\nsoon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on\\npromising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and\\nafter much chaffering I got our stones at 1000 pounds apiece. Then I looked\\nin upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed\\nabout two o’clock, after what I may call a really hard day’s work.”\\n“A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,” said the\\nbanker, rising. “Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find\\nme ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all\\nthat I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to\\nhim for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor\\nMary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where\\nshe is now.”\\n“I think that we may safely say,” returned Holmes, “that she is wherever Sir\\nGeorge Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are,\\nthey will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.”\\n12.\\nThe Adventure of the Copper Beeches.\\n“To the man who loves art for its own sake,” remarked Sherlock Holmes,\\ntossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, “it is\\nfrequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest\\npleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you\\nhave so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which\\nyou have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say,\\noccasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the\\nmany causes célèbres and sensational trials in which I have figured but\\nrather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but\\nwhich have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical\\nsynthesis which I have made my special province.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net375\\n“And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the\\ncharge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.”\\n“You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with\\nthe tongs and lighting with it the long cherrywood pipe which was wont to\\nreplace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative\\nmood—”you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into\\neach of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing\\nupon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the\\nonly notable feature about the thing.”\\n“It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,” I remarked\\nwith some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more\\nthan once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s singular character.\\n“No, it is not selfishness or conceit,” said he, answering, as was his wont,\\nmy thoughts rather than my words. “If I claim full justice for my art, it is\\nbecause it is an impersonal thing— a thing beyond myself. Crime is\\ncommon. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the\\ncrime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a\\ncourse of lectures into a series of tales.”\\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on\\neither side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog\\nrolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing\\nwindows loomed like\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net377\\ndark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and\\nshone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had\\nnot been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning,\\ndipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of\\npapers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged\\nin no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\\n“At the same time,” he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat\\npuffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, “you can hardly be\\nopen to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have\\nbeen so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of\\ncrime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to\\nhelp the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary\\nSutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and\\nthe incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the\\npale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have\\nbordered on the trivial.”\\n“The end may have been so,” I answered, “but the methods\\nI hold to have been novel and of interest.”\\n“Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the publi c, the great un\\nobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his t ooth\\nor a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades\\nof analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot blame\\nyou, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man,\\nhas lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems\\nto be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and\\ngiving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have\\ntouched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my\\nzero-point, I fancy. Read it!” He tossed a crumpled letter\\nacross to me.\\nIt was dated f rom Montague Place upon the preceding\\nevening, and ran thus:\\n“DEAR MR. HOLME S:—I am very anxious to consult\\nyou as to whether I should or should not accept a situati on\\nwhich has been offered to me as governess. I shall call a t halfpast ten tomorrow\\nif I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,\\n“VIOLET HUNTER.”\\n“Do you know the young lady?” I asked.\\n“Not I.”\\n“It is hal f-past ten now.”\\n“Yes, and I have no doub t that is her ring.”\\n“It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You\\nremember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere\\nwhim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this\\ncase, also.”\\n“Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here,\\nunless I am much mistaken, is the person in ques\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net379 tion.”\\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was\\nplainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover’s\\negg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to\\nmake in the world.\\n“You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,” said she, as my companion\\nrose to greet her, “but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no\\nparents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that\\nperhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.”\\n“Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to\\nserve you.”\\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and\\nspeech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and\\nthen composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together,\\nto listen to her story.\\n“I have been a gover ness for five years,” said she, “in the family of Colonel\\nSpence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at\\nHalifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so\\nthat I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered\\nadvertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had\\nsaved began to run short, and I was at my wit’s end as to what I should do.\\n“There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End calle d\\nWestaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see\\nwhether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the\\nname of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss\\nStoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking\\nemployment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when\\nshe consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would\\nsuit them.\\n“Well, wh en I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual,\\nbut I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a\\nvery smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon\\nfold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose,\\nlooking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite\\na jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\\n“‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for any thing better. Capital!\\ncapital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the\\nmost genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was\\nquite a pleasure to look at him.\\n“‘You are looking for a situatio n, miss?’ he asked.\\n“‘Yes, sir.’\\n“‘As gover ness?’\\n“‘Yes, sir.’\\n“‘And wha t salary do you ask?’\\n“‘I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.’\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net381\\n“‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat hands\\nout into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. ‘How could anyone\\noffer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?’\\n“‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,’ said I. ‘A little\\nFrench, a little German, music, and drawing— ’\\n“‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have\\nyou or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a\\nnutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who\\nmay some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if\\nyou have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to\\naccept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam,\\nwould commence at 100 pounds a year.’\\n“You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer\\nseemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps\\nthe look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a\\nnote.\\n“‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until\\nhis eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face,\\n‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they\\nmay meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.’\\n“It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a\\nman. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great\\nconvenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole\\ntransaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite\\ncommitted myself.\\n“‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.\\n“‘Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the\\nfar side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady,\\nand the dearest old country-house.’\\n“‘And my duties, sir? I should be gl ad to know what they would be.’\\n“‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you co uld see\\nhim killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone\\nbefore you could wink!’ He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes\\ninto his head again.\\n“I was a little star tled at the nature of the child’s amusement, but the\\nfather’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\\n“‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take charge of a sing le child?’\\n“‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,’ he cried. ‘Your\\nduty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any\\nlittle commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such\\ncommands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?’\\n“‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’\\n“‘Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know—\\nfaddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net383\\nany dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little\\nwhim. Heh?’\\n“‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.\\n“‘Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offen sive to you?’\\n“‘Oh, no.’\\n“‘Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?’\\n“I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, M r. Holmes, my hair\\nis somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been\\nconsidered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand\\nfashion.\\n“‘I am a fraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I. He had been watching me\\neagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as\\nI spoke.\\n“‘I am a fraid that it is quite essential,’ said he. ‘It is a little fancy of my\\nwife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you know, madam, ladies’ fancies must be\\nconsulted. And so you won’t cut your hair?’\\n“‘No, sir, I really could not,’ I answered firm ly.\\n“‘Ah, very well; then that quite settles the ma tter. It is a pity, because in\\nother respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss\\nStoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.’\\n“The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word\\nto either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon\\nher face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome\\ncommission through my refusal.\\n“‘Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’ she asked.\\n“‘If you please, Miss Stoper.’\\n“‘Well, really, it seems rathe r useless, since you refuse the most excellent\\noffers in this fashion,’ said she sharply. ‘You can hardly expect us to exert\\nourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss\\nHunter.’ She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough\\nin the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table. I began to ask myself\\nwhether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had\\nstrange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters,\\nthey were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses\\nin England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides, what use was my hair to\\nme? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be\\namong the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a\\nmistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my\\npride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was\\nstill open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it\\nhere and I will read it to you: “‘The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\\n“‘DEAR MISS HUNTER:—Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your\\naddress, and I write from here\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net385\\nto ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very\\nanxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my\\ndescription of you. We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter, or 120\\npounds a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which\\nour fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is\\nfond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a\\ndress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of\\npurchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now\\nin Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to\\nsitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need\\ncause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity,\\nespecially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short\\ninterview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only\\nhope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your\\nduties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come,\\nand I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your\\ntrain.\\nYours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.’\\n“That is the letter which I have just rece ived, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is\\nmade up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final\\nstep I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.”\\n“Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the questio n,” said\\nHolmes, smiling.\\n“But you would n ot advise me to refuse?”\\n“I confess that it is not the situation whic h I should like to see a sister of\\nmine apply for.”\\n“What is the mea ning of it all, Mr. Holmes?”\\n“Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps y ou have yourself formed some\\nopinion?”\\n“Well, the re seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle\\nseemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife\\nis a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be\\ntaken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order\\nto prevent an outbreak?”\\n“That is a possible sol ution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the most\\nprobable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a\\nyoung lady.”\\n“But the mon ey, Mr. Holmes, the money!”\\n“Well, yes, of course the pay is good—to o good. That is what makes me\\nuneasy. Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when they could have\\ntheir pick for 40 pounds? There must be some strong reason behind.”\\n“I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would unde rstand\\nafterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that\\nyou were at the back of me.”\\n“Oh, you may carry that feel ing away with you. I assure you that your little\\nproblem promises to be the most interesting\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net387\\nwhich has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly\\nnovel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in\\ndanger—”\\n“Danger! What danger do you foresee?”\\nHolmes shook his head gravely. “It would cease to be a danger if we could\\ndefine it,” said he. “But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring\\nme down to your help.”\\n“That is enough.” She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept\\nfrom her face. “I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I\\nshall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start\\nfor Winchester to-morrow.” With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade\\nus both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\\n“At least,” said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs,\\n“she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.”\\n“And she would need to be,” said Holmes gravely. “I am much mistaken if\\nwe do not hear from her before many days are past.”\\nIt was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight\\nwent by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her\\ndirection and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this\\nlonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions,\\nthe light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or\\na plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite\\nbeyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat\\nfrequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air,\\nbut he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it.\\n“Data! data! data!” he cried impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without clay.”\\nAnd yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should\\never have accepted such a situation.\\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I\\nwas thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those\\nall-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I\\nwould leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him\\nin the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He\\nopened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it\\nacross to me.\\n“Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,” said he, and turned back to his\\nchemical studies.\\nThe summons wa s a brief and urgent one.\\n“Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Wi nchester at midday to-morrow,” it\\nsaid. “Do come! I am at my wit’s end. HUNTER.”\\n“Will you come with me?” asked Holmes, glancing up.\\n“I should wish to.”\\n“Just look it up, the n.”\\n“There is a train at half -past nine,” said I, glancing over my\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net389\\nBradshaw. “It is due at Winchester at 11:30.”\\n“That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better post\\npone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be a t our\\nbest in the morning.”\\nBy eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way\\nto the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the\\nmorning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the\\nHampshire border he threw them down and began to admire\\nthe scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, fleck ed\\nwith little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east.\\nThe sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhila rating nip in\\nthe air, which set an edge to a man’s energy.\\nAll over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around\\nAldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadin gs\\npeeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage. “Ar e they not fresh\\nand beautiful?” I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs\\nof Baker Street. But Holmes shook his head gravely.\\n“Do you know, Watson,” said he, “that it is one of th e curses\\nof a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything\\nwith reference to my own special subject. You look at these\\nscattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I lo ok\\nat them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling\\nof their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may\\nbe committed there.”\\n“Good heavens!” I cr ied. “Who would associate crime with\\nthese dear old homesteads?”\\n“They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief,\\nWatson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest an d vilest alleys in\\nLondon do not present a more dreadful record of\\nsin than does the smiling and beautiful countrysid e.” “You horrify me!”\\n“But the reason is very obvious.The pressure of public opinion can do in the\\ntown what the law cannot accomplish. There\\nis no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the\\nthud of a drunkard’s blow, does not beget sympathy and in dignation among\\nthe neighbours, and then the whole machinery\\nof justice is ever so close that a word of compl aint can set it\\ngoing, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock .\\nBut look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled f or\\nthe most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the\\nlaw. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wicked ness which may\\ngo on, year in, year out, in such places, and\\nnone the wiser. Had this lady who appeals t o us for help gone\\nto live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It\\nis the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is\\nclear that she is not personally threatened.”\\n“No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get\\naway.”\\n“Quite so. She has her freedom.”\\n“What can be the matter, then? C an you suggest no explanation?”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net391\\n“I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the\\nfacts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be\\ndetermined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting\\nfor us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all\\nthat Miss Hunter has to tell.”\\nThe Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from\\nthe station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had\\nengaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\\n“I am so delighted that you have come,” she said earnestly. “It is so very\\nkind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice\\nwill be altogether invaluable to me.”\\n“Pray tell us what has happened to you.”\\n“I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be\\nback before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he\\nlittle knew for what purpose.”\\n“Let us have everything in its due order.” Holmes thrust his long thin legs\\nout towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\\n“In the first place, I may say that I have met, on th e whole, with no actual\\nill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that.\\nBut I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.”\\n“What can you not understand?”\\n“Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred.\\nWhen I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart\\nto the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not\\nbeautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but\\nall stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds\\nround it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down\\nto the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards\\nfrom the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the\\nwoods all round are part of Lord Southerton’s preserves. A clump of copper\\nbeeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the\\nplace.\\n“I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was\\nintroduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no\\ntruth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in\\nyour rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a\\nsilent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than\\nthirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their\\nconversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years,\\nthat he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the\\ndaughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that\\nthe reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion\\nto her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I\\ncan quite imagine that her posi\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net393 tion must have been uncomfo rtable with her father’s young wife.\\n“Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature.\\nShe impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity.\\nIt was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband\\nand to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to\\nthe other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind\\nto her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to\\nbe a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She\\nwould often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face.\\nMore than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that\\nit was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have\\nnever met so utterly spoiled and so illnatured a little creature. He is small\\nfor his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole\\nlife appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and\\ngloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than\\nhimself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite\\nremarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects.\\nBut I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he\\nhas little to do with my story.”\\n“I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they seem to you\\nto be relevant or not.”\\n“I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing\\nabout the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct\\nof the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is\\nhis name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a\\nperpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been\\nquite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is\\na very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle\\nand much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I\\nspend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to\\neach other in one corner of the building.\\n“For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very\\nquiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and\\nwhispered something to her husband.\\n“‘Oh, yes,’ said he, turning to me, ‘we are very much obliged to you, Miss\\nHunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you\\nthat it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall\\nnow see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid\\nout upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on\\nwe should both be extremely obliged.’\\n“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It\\nwas of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of\\nhaving been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been\\nmeasured for it. Both\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net395\\nMr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed\\nquite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the\\ndrawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front\\nof the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair\\nhad been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it.\\nIn this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on\\nthe other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories\\nthat I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I\\nlaughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently\\nno sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her\\nlap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle\\nsuddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and\\nthat I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\\n“Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly\\nsimilar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window,\\nand again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer\\nhad an immense répertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed\\nme a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my\\nown shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to\\nhim. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and\\nthen suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to\\nchange my dress. “You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I\\nbecame as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could\\npossibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face\\naway from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see\\nwhat was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but\\nI soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy\\nthought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief.\\nOn the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up\\nto my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was\\nbehind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least\\nthat was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived\\nthat there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded\\nman in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is\\nan important highway, and there are usually people there. This man,\\nhowever, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was\\nlooking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs.\\nRucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She\\nsaid nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in\\nmy hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.\\n“‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who\\nstares up at Miss Hunter.’\\n“‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net397 “‘No, I know no one in these parts.’\\n“‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to\\ngo away.’\\n“‘Surely i t would be better to take no notice.’\\n“‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and\\nwave him away like that.’\\n“I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the\\nblind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the\\nwindow, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.”\\n“Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative promises to be a most\\ninteresting one.”\\n“You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little\\nrelation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first\\nday that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small\\nouthouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard\\nthe sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving\\nabout.\\n“‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks.\\n‘Is he not a beauty?’\\n“I looked through an d was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague\\nfigure huddled up in the darkness.\\n“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my em ployer, laughing at the start which I had\\ngiven. ‘It’s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my\\ngroom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a\\nday, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller\\nlets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his\\nfangs upon. For goodness’ sake don’t you ever on any pretext set your foot\\nover the threshold at night, for it’s as much as your life is worth.’\\n“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of\\nmy bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a beautiful\\nmoonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and\\nalmost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the\\nscene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of\\nthe copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It\\nwas a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black\\nmuzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and\\nvanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a\\nchill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\\n“And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you k now,\\ncut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom\\nof my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse\\nmyself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own\\nlittle things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper\\nones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net399\\nthe first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was\\nnaturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that\\nit might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of\\nkeys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew\\nthe drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you\\nwould never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.\\n“I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same\\nthickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me.\\nHow could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I\\nundid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own\\nhair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were\\nidentical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing\\nat all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said\\nnothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the\\nwrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.\\n“I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I\\nsoon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one\\nwing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which\\nfaced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite,\\nbut it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I\\nmet Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a\\nlook on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial\\nman to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all\\ncrinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He\\nlocked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.\\n“This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds\\nwith my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the\\nwindows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three\\nof which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were\\nevidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them\\noccasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as\\never.\\n“‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word,\\nmy dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.’\\n“I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I, ‘you seem to\\nhave quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters\\nup.’\\n“He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.\\n“‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I have made my dark room\\nup there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.\\nWho would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?’ He spoke\\nin a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read\\nsuspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net401\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\\nsomething about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on\\nfire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of\\nthat. It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good might come\\nfrom my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s instinct; perhaps it\\nwas woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,\\nand I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\\n“It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr.\\nRucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted\\nrooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him\\nthrough the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday\\nevening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in\\nthe door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs.\\nRucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had\\nan admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the\\ndoor, and slipped through.\\n“There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which\\nturned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors\\nin a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an\\nempty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in\\nthe other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through\\nthem. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been\\nfastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring\\nin the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was\\nlocked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door\\ncorresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see\\nby the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness.\\nEvidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in\\nthe passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might\\nveil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow\\npass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone\\nout from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the\\nsight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned\\nand ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at\\nthe skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and\\nstraight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\\n“‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I\\nsaw the door open.’\\n“‘Oh, I am so fright ened!’ I panted.\\n“‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you cannot think how\\ncaressing and soothing his manner was—’and what has frightened you, my\\ndear young lady?’\\n“But his voice wa s just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on\\nmy guard against him.\\n“‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I an\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net403\\nswered. ‘But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened\\nand ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’\\n“‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.\\n“‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.\\n“‘Why do you think that I lock this do or?’\\n“‘I am sure that I do not know.’\\n“‘It is to keep people out who h ave no business there. Do\\nyou see?’ He was still smiling in the most amiable manner. “‘I am sure if I\\nhad known—’\\n“‘Well, then, y ou know now. And if you ever put your foot\\nover that threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin\\nof rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—’I’ll throw\\nyou to the mastiff.’\\n“I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have\\nrushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself\\nlying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I\\ncould not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the\\nhouse, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They\\nwere all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well.\\nOf course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as\\nstrong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I\\nput on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile\\nfrom the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible\\ndoubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be\\nloose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of\\ninsensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the\\nhousehold who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would\\nventure to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in\\nmy joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to\\ncome into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock,\\nfor Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the\\nevening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my\\nadventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what\\nit all means, and, above all, what I should do.”\\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend\\nrose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an\\nexpression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\\n“Is Toller still drunk?” he asked.\\n“Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with\\nhim.”\\n“That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Is the re a cellar with a good strong lock?”\\n“Yes, the wine-cellar.”\\n“You seem to me to ha ve acted all through this matter like a very brave and\\nsensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net405 you could perform one more f eat? I should not ask it of you if\\nI did not think you a quite exceptional woman.”\\n“I will try. What is it?”\\n“We shall be at the Cop per Beeches by seven o’clock, my\\nfriend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we\\nhope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the\\nalarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn\\nthe key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.”\\n“I will do it.”\\n“Excellent! W e shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is\\nonly one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate\\nsomeone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is\\nobvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter,\\nMiss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to\\nAmerica. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure,\\nand the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some\\nillness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be\\nsacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in\\nthe road was undoubtedly some friend of hers—possibly her fiancé—and\\nno doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress and were so like her, he was\\nconvinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from\\nyour gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer\\ndesired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from\\nendeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most\\nserious point in the case is the disposition of the child.”\\n“What on earth has that to do with it?” I ejaculated.\\n“My dear Watson, you as a medical man are contin ually gaining light as to\\nthe tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see that the\\nconverse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into\\nthe character of parents by studying their children. This child’s disposition\\nis abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s sake, and whether he derives this\\nfrom his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes\\nevil for the poor girl who is in their power.”\\n“I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes, ” cried our client. “A thousand\\nthings come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let\\nus lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.”\\n“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cu nning man. We\\ncan do nothing until seven o’clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it\\nwill not be long before we solve the mystery.”\\nWe were as good as our word, for it was jus t seven when we reached the\\nCopper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The\\ngroup of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the\\nlight of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss\\nHunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net407 “Have you managed it?” aske d Holmes.\\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. “That is Mrs.\\nToller in the cellar,” said she. “Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug.\\nHere are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle’s.”\\n“You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes with enthusiasm. “Now lead\\nthe way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.”\\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and\\nfound ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described.\\nHolmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the\\nvarious keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within,\\nand at the silence Holmes’ face clouded over.\\n“I trust that we are not too late,” said he. “I think, Miss Hunter, that we had\\nbetter go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall\\nsee whether we cannot make our way in.”\\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.\\nTogether we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture\\nsave a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight\\nabove was open, and the prisoner gone.\\n“There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes; “this beauty has guessed\\nMiss Hunter’s intentions and has carried his victim off.”\\n“But how?”\\n“Through th e skylight. We shall soon see how he managed\\nit.” He swung himself up onto the roof. “Ah, yes,” he cried, “here’s the end\\nof a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.”\\n“But it is impossible,” said Miss Hunter; “the ladder was not there when the\\nRucastles went away.”\\n“He has come back an d done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous\\nman. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear\\nnow upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have\\nyour pistol ready.”\\nThe words were ha rdly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door\\nof the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss\\nHunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but\\nSherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\\n“You villain!” said he, “where’s your daughter?”\\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at th e open skylight.\\n“It is for me to ask you that,” he shrieked, “you thieves! Spies and thieves! I\\nhave caught you, have I? You are in my power. I’ll serve you!” He turned\\nand clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\\n“He’s gone for the dog!” cried Miss Hunter.\\n“I have my revolver,” said I.\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net409\\n“Better close the front door,” cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the\\nstairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of\\na hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which\\nit was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking\\nlimbs came staggering out at a side door.\\n“My God!” he cried. “Someone has loosed the dog. It’s not been fed for two\\ndays. Quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!”\\nHolmes and I rushed out and round t he angle of the house, with Toller\\nhurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle\\nburied in Rucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground.\\nRunning up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth\\nstill meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we\\nseparated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house.\\nWe laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the\\nsobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his\\npain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall,\\ngaunt woman entered the room.\\n“Mrs. Toller!” cried Miss Hunte r.\\n“Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me o ut when he came back before he went up\\nto you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were\\nplanning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”\\n“Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is clear that Mrs. To ller knows\\nmore about this matter than anyone else.”\\n“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to t ell what I know.”\\n“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are s everal points on\\nwhich I must confess that I am still in the dark.”\\n“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “a nd I’d have done so before\\nnow if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If there’s police-court business\\nover this, you’ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and\\nthat I was Miss Alice’s friend too.\\n“She was never happy at home, M iss Alice wasn’t, from the time that her\\nfather married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but\\nit never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a\\nfriend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by\\nwill, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word\\nabout them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle’s hands. He knew he was\\nsafe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward,\\nwho would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought\\nit time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she\\nmarried or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept\\non worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s\\ndoor. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her\\nbeautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young man, and\\nhe stuck to her as true as man could be.”\\nhttp://collegebookshelf.net411\\n“Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good enough to tell us\\nmakes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr.\\nRucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?”\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n“And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the\\ndisagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.”\\n“That was it, sir.”\\n“But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,\\nblockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,\\nmetallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same\\nas his.”\\n“Mr. Fo wler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said Mrs.\\nToller serenely.\\n“And in this wa y he managed that your good man should have no want of\\ndrink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master\\nhad gone out.”\\n“You have it, s ir, just as it happened.”\\n“I am sure we owe you an apology, M rs.Toller,” said Holmes, “for you have\\ncertainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the\\ncountry surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best\\nescort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus\\nstandi now is rather a questionable one.”\\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of t he sinister house with the copper\\nbeeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a\\nbroken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They\\nstill live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle’s\\npast life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss\\nRucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after\\ntheir flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the\\nisland of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to\\nmy disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had\\nceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a\\nprivate school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable\\nsuccess.\\n'"

              "'Adventure 1.\\nA Scandal in Bohemia.\\n1.\\nTo Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him\\nmention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\\npredominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin\\nto love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were\\nabhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take\\nit, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has\\nseen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He\\nnever spoke of the softer passions, save with a\\n 3\\ngibe and a sneer.They were admirable things for the observer— excellent\\nfor drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained\\nreasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted\\ntemperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a\\ndoubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack\\nin one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a\\nstrong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to\\nhim, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable\\nmemory.\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from\\neach other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests\\nwhich rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own\\nestablishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes,\\nwho loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained\\nin our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating\\nfrom week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the\\ndrug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever,\\ndeeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties\\nand extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and\\nclearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the\\nofficial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings:\\nof his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing\\nup of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\\nfinally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his\\nactivity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily\\npress, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\\nOne night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a\\njourney to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way\\nled me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which\\nmust always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark\\nincidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see\\nHolmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary\\npowers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his\\ntall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was\\npacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his\\nhands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his\\nattitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had\\nrisen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some\\nnew problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had\\nformerly been in part my own.\\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see\\nme. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an\\narmchair, threw across his case\\n 5\\nof cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he\\nstood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective\\nfashion.\\n“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put on\\nseven and a half pounds since I saw you.”\\n“Seven!” I answered.\\n“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy,\\nWatson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you\\nintended to go into harness.”\\n“Then, how do you know?”\\n“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself\\nvery wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?”\\n“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have been\\nburned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country\\nwalk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed\\nmy clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is\\nincorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see\\nhow you work it out.”\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\\n“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside of your\\nleft shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six\\nalmost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has\\nvery carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove\\ncrusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had\\nbeen out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant bootslitting\\nspecimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman\\nwalks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of\\nsilver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat\\nto show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I\\ndo not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of\\ndeduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked, “the thing\\nalways appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it\\nmyself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled\\nuntil you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good\\nas yours.”\\n“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down\\ninto an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.\\nFor example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the\\nhall to this room.”\\n“Frequently.”\\n“How often?”\\n“Well, some hundreds of times.”\\n“Then how many are there?”\\n“How many? I don’t know.”\\n 7\\n“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my\\npoint. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen\\nand observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these little problems,\\nand since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling\\nexperiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of thick,\\npink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table. “It came\\nby the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\n“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it said, “a\\ngentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest\\nmoment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have\\nshown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of\\nan importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we\\nhave from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and\\ndo not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.”\\n“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it\\nmeans?”\\n“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.\\nInsensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to\\nsuit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?”\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\\n“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\\nendeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not\\nbe bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.”\\n“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English paper\\nat all. Hold it up to the light.”\\nI did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G” with a\\nsmall “t” woven into the texture of the paper.\\n“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\\n“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\\n“Not at all.The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the\\nGerman for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of\\ncourse, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us glance at our\\nContinental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume from his\\nshelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking\\ncountry—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable as being the\\nscene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and\\npaper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?” His eyes\\nsparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\\n“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\\n“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\\npeculiar construction of the sentence—’This\\n 9\\naccount of you we have from all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or\\nRussian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous\\nto his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this\\nGerman who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to\\nshowing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all\\nour doubts.”\\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheels\\nagainst the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.\\n“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of the\\nwindow. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty\\nguineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing\\nelse.”\\n“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”\\n“Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And\\nthis promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”\\n“But your client—”\\n“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit\\ndown in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\\npassage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\\nauthoritative tap.\\n“Come in!” said Holmes.\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in\\nheight, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a\\nrichness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste.\\nHeavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his\\ndouble-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his\\nshoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a\\nbrooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended\\nhalfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown\\nfur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by\\nhis whole appearance. He carried a broadbrimmed hat in his hand, while he\\nwore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones,\\na black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,\\nfor his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the\\nface he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\\nand a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of\\nobstinacy.\\n“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\\nmarked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from one\\nto the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\n“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr.\\nWatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\\nhave I the honour to address?”\\n 11\\n“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\\nunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\\ndiscretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance.\\nIf not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.”\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\\nmy chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this gentleman\\nanything which you may say to me.”\\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he, “by\\nbinding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time\\nthe matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that\\nit is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.”\\n“I promise,” said Holmes.\\n“And I.”\\n“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor.\\n“The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to\\nyou, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called\\nmyself is not exactly my own.”\\n“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.\\n“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be\\ntaken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously\\ncompromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the\\nmatter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of\\nBohemia.”\\n“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his\\narmchair and closing his eyes.\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging\\nfigure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most\\nincisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly\\nreopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\\n“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I\\nshould be better able to advise you.”\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\\nuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the\\nmask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,” he cried;\\n“I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?”\\n“Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken before I\\nwas aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of CasselFelstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.”\\n“But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once more\\nand passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can understand that\\nI am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the\\nmatter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting\\nmyself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of\\nconsulting you.”\\n“Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\n 13\\n“The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to\\nWarsaw, I made the acquaintance of the wellknown adventuress, Irene\\nAdler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.”\\n“Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes without\\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all\\nparagraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a\\nsubject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In\\nthis case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew\\nrabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the\\ndeep-sea fishes.\\n“Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.\\nContralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—\\nyes! Retired from operatic stage— ha! Living in London—quite so! Your\\nMajesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote\\nher some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters\\nback.”\\n“Precisely so. But how—”\\n“Was there a secret marriage?”\\n“None.”\\n“No legal papers or certificates?”\\n“None.”\\n“Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person\\nshould produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\\nprove their authenticity?”\\n“There is the writing.”\\n“Pooh, pooh! Forgery.”\\n“My private note-paper.”\\n“Stolen.”\\n“My own seal.”\\n“Imitated.”\\n“My photograph.”\\n“Bought.”\\n“We were both in the photograph.”\\n“Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\\nindiscretion.”\\n“I was mad—insane.”\\n“You have compromised yourself seriously.”\\n“I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty\\nnow.”\\n“It must be recovered.”\\n“We have tried and failed.”\\n“Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.”\\n“She will not sell.”\\n“Stolen, then.”\\n“Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay\\nransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled.\\nTwice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.”\\n“No sign of it?”\\n 15\\n“Absolutely none.”\\nHolmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he.\\n“But a very serious one to me,” returned the King reproachfully.\\n“Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?”\\n“To ruin me.”\\n“But how?”\\n“I am about to be married.”\\n“So I have heard.”\\n“To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\\nScandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is\\nherself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct\\nwould bring the matter to an end.”\\n“And Irene Adler?”\\n“Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she\\nwill do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face\\nof the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men.\\nRather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which\\nshe would not go—none.”\\n“You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”\\n“I am sure.”\\n“And why?”\\n“Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal\\nwas publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.”\\n“Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmes with a yawn. “That is very\\nfortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at\\npresent. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?”\\n“Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count\\nVon Kramm.”\\n“Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.”\\n“Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.”\\n“Then, as to money?”\\n“You have carte blanche.”\\n“Absolutely?”\\n“I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have\\nthat photograph.”\\n“And for present expenses?”\\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it\\non the table.\\n“There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he\\nsaid.\\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to\\nhim.\\n“And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked.\\n“Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.”\\n 17\\nHolmes took a note of it. “One other question,” said he. “Was the\\nphotograph a cabinet?”\\n“It was.”\\n“Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some\\ngood news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheels of\\nthe royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be good enough to\\ncall to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like to chat this little\\nmatter over with you.”\\n2.\\nAt three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet\\nreturned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after\\neight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the\\nintention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply\\ninterested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim\\nand strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I\\nhave already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of\\nhis client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made\\nit a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick,\\nsubtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries.\\nSo accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his\\nfailing had ceased to enter into my head.\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\\ngroom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\\ndisreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my\\nfriend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times\\nbefore I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the\\nbedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable,\\nas of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in\\nfront of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.\\n“Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was\\nobliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\\n“What is it?”\\n“It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my\\nmorning, or what I ended by doing.”\\n“I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and\\nperhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.”\\n“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left\\nthe house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the character of a\\ngroom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among\\nhorsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I\\nsoon\\n 19\\nfound Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built\\nout in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large\\nsitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to\\nthe floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child\\ncould open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage\\nwindow could be reached from the top of the coachhouse. I walked round it\\nand examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting\\nanything else of interest.\\n“I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a\\nmews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers\\na hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a\\nglass of half and half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as\\nI could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people\\nin the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose\\nbiographies I was compelled to listen to.”\\n“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.\\n“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the\\ndaintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews,\\nto a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day,\\nand returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except\\nwhen she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is\\ndark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often\\ntwice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages\\nof a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from\\nSerpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they\\nhad to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and\\nto think over my plan of campaign.\\n“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He\\nwas a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them,\\nand what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or\\nhis mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to\\nhis keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question\\ndepended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my\\nattention to the gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point,\\nand it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\\ndetails, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to\\nunderstand the situation.”\\n“I am following you closely,” I answered.\\n“I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to\\nBriony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome\\nman, dark, aquiline, and moustached— evidently the man of whom I had\\nheard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait,\\nand brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who\\nwas thoroughly at home.\\n 21\\n“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him\\nin the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly,\\nand waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged,\\nlooking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he\\npulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, ‘Drive like\\nthe devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross & Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then\\nto the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do\\nit in twenty minutes!’\\n“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to\\nfollow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with\\nhis coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of\\nhis harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t pulled up before she\\nshot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the\\nmoment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\\n“‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if you\\nreach it in twenty minutes.’\\n“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I\\nshould run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab\\ncame through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I\\njumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St. Monica,’ said I, ‘and\\nhalf a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ It was twentyfive\\nminutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\\n“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others were\\nthere before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in\\nfront of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church.\\nThere was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a\\nsurpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were\\nall three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle\\nlike any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my\\nsurprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came\\nrunning as hard as he could towards me.\\n“‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come! Come!’\\n“‘What then?’ I asked.\\n“‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’\\n“I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found\\nmyself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching\\nfor things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure\\ntying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all\\ndone in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side\\nand the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It\\nwas the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life,\\nand it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that\\nthere had been\\n 23\\nsome informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused\\nto marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky\\nappearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in\\nsearch of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it\\non my watchchain in memory of the occasion.”\\n“This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and what then?”\\n“Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair\\nmight take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and\\nenergetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they\\nseparated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I shall\\ndrive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said as she left him. I heard no\\nmore. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my\\nown arrangements.”\\n“Which are?”\\n“Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell. “I have\\nbeen too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this\\nevening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.”\\n“I shall be delighted.”\\n“You don’t mind breaking the law?”\\n“Not in the least.”\\n“Nor running a chance of arrest?”\\n“Not in a good cause.”\\n“Oh, the cause is excellent!”\\n“Then I am your man.”\\n“I was sure that I might rely on you.”\\n“But what is it you wish?”\\n“When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.\\nNow,” he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had\\nprovided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is\\nnearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss\\nIrene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at\\nBriony Lodge to meet her.”\\n“And what then?”\\n“You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There\\nis only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what\\nmay. You understand?”\\n“I am to be neutral?”\\n“To do nothing whatever.There will probably be some small\\nunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the\\nhouse. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open.\\nYou are to station yourself close to that open window.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give\\nyou to throw, and will, at the same time, raise\\n 25\\nthe cry of fire. You quite follow me?”\\n“Entirely.”\\n“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar- shaped roll\\nfrom his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke- rocket, fitted with a\\ncap at either end to make it selflighting. Your task is confined to that. When\\nyou raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people.\\nYou may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten\\nminutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?”\\n“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the\\nsignal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at\\nthe corner of the street.”\\n“Precisely.”\\n“Then you may entirely rely on me.”\\n“That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I\\nprepare for the new role I have to play.”\\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the\\ncharacter of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His\\nbroad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and\\ngeneral look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John\\nHare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his\\ncostume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with\\nevery fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science\\nlost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.\\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten\\nminutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was\\nalready dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and\\ndown in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The\\nhouse was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’ succinct\\ndescription, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On\\nthe contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably\\nanimated.There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing\\nin a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were\\nflirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were\\nlounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.\\n“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house,\\n“this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a doubleedged\\nweapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being\\nseen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his\\nprincess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?”\\n“Where, indeed?”\\n“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too\\nlarge for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows that the King\\nis capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort\\nhave already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it\\nabout\\n 27\\nwith her.”\\n“Where, then?”\\n“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility.\\nBut I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they\\nlike to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?\\nShe could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or\\npolitical influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides,\\nremember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be\\nwhere she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.”\\n“But it has twice been burgled.”\\n“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\\n“But how will you look?”\\n“I will not look.”\\n“What then?”\\n“I will get her to show me.”\\n“But she will refuse.”\\n“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It\\nis her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”\\nAs he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the curve\\nof the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of\\nBriony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed\\nforward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed\\naway by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A\\nfierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who\\ntook sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was\\nequally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the\\nlady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of\\nflushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their\\nfists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just\\nas he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood\\nrunning freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels\\nin one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of betterdressed\\npeople, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\\ncrowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as\\nI will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her\\nsuperb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the\\nstreet.\\n“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked. “He is dead,” cried several\\nvoices.\\n“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be\\ngone before you can get him to hospital.”\\n“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had\\nthe lady’s purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were\\na gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.” “He can’t lie in the\\nstreet. May we bring him in, marm?” “Surely. Bring him into the sittingroom.\\nThere is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!”\\n 29\\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\\nprincipal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the\\nwindow. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that\\nI could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was\\nseized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I\\nknow that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than\\nwhen I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the\\ngrace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet\\nit would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the\\npart which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the\\nsmokerocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring\\nher. We are but preventing her from injuring another.\\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is\\nin need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the\\nsame instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket\\ninto the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out of my\\nmouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill—\\ngentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids—joined in a general shriek of “Fire!”\\nThick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open\\nwindow. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice\\nof Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping\\nthrough the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and\\nin ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm in mine, and to get\\naway from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some\\nfew minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead\\ntowards the Edgeware Road.\\n“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been\\nbetter. It is all right.”\\n“You have the photograph?”\\n“I know where it is.”\\n“And how did you find out?”\\n“She showed me, as I told you she would.”\\n“I am still in the dark.”\\n“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was\\nperfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an\\naccomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\\n“I guessed as much.”\\n“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of\\nmy hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and\\nbecame a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\\n“That also I could fathom.”\\n“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\\nshe do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\\nsuspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see\\nwhich. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to\\n 31\\nopen the window, and you had your chance.”\\n“How did that help you?”\\n“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house\\nis on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most.\\nIt is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\\nadvantage of it. In the case of the Darlington substitution scandal it was of\\nuse to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman\\ngrabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was\\nclear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious\\nto her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm\\nof fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake\\nnerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess\\nbehind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an\\ninstant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she halfdrew it out. When I cried out\\nthat it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from\\nthe room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses,\\nescaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the\\nphotograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching\\nme narrowly it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin\\nall.”\\n“And now?” I asked.\\n“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and\\nwith you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sittingroom\\nto wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may\\nfind neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty\\nto regain it with his own hands.”\\n“And when will you call?”\\n“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear\\nfield. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete\\nchange in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.”\\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching\\nhis pockets for the key when someone passing said:\\n“Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.”\\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\\nappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\\n“I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit\\nstreet. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.”\\n3.\\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and\\ncoffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\\n“You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes\\n 33\\nby either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face. “Not yet.”\\n“But you have hopes?”\\n“I have hopes.”\\n“Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.” “We must have a cab.”\\n“No, my brougham is waiting.”\\n“Then that will simplify matters.” We descended and started\\noff once more for Briony Lodge.\\n“Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes.\\n“Married! When?”\\n“Yesterday.”\\n“But to whom?”\\n“To an English lawyer named Norton.”\\n“But she could not love him.”\\n“I am in hopes that she does.”\\n“And why in hopes?”\\n“Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the\\nlady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love\\nyour Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your\\nMajesty’s plan.”\\n“It is true. And yet—Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a\\nqueen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence, which was\\nnot broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the\\nsteps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\\nbrougham.\\n“Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she.\\n“I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a\\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\\n“Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this\\nmorning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the\\nContinent.”\\n“What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise.\\n“Do you mean that she has left England?”\\n“Never to return.”\\n“And the papers?” asked the King hoarsely. “All is lost.”\\n“We shall see.” He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawingroom,\\nfollowed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about\\nin every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady\\nhad hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bellpull,\\ntore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out\\na photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in\\nevening dress, the letter was superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be\\nleft till called for.” My friend tore it open and we all three read it together. It\\nwas dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\\n“MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well.\\nYou took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a\\nsuspicion. But then, when I found\\n 35\\nhow I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you\\nmonths ago. I had been told that if the King employed an agent it would\\ncertainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this,\\nyou made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\\nsuspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman.\\nBut, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is\\nnothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I\\nsent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walkingclothes,\\nas I call them, and came down just as you departed.\\n“Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an\\nobject of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather\\nimprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my\\nhusband.\\n“We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so\\nformidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call tomorrow.\\nAs to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am\\nloved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without\\nhindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to\\nsafeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me\\nfrom any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph\\nwhich he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\n“Very truly yours,\\n“IRENE NORTON, née ADLER.\\n“What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia, when\\nwe had all three read this epistle. “Did I not tell you how quick and resolute\\nshe was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that\\nshe was not on my level?”\\n“From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very\\ndifferent level to your Majesty,” said Holmes coldly. “I am sorry that I have\\nnot been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more successful\\nconclusion.”\\n“On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King; “nothing could be more\\nsuccessful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe\\nas if it were in the fire.”\\n“I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.”\\n“I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward\\nyou. This ring—” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and\\nheld it out upon the palm of his hand.\\n“Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,” said\\nHolmes.\\n“You have but to name it.”\\n“This photograph!”\\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\\n“Irene’s photograph!” he cried. “Certainly, if you wish it.”\\n“I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I\\nhave the honour to wish you a very good-morning.” He bowed, and, turning\\naway without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him,\\nhe set off in my\\n 37\\ncompany for his chambers.\\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of\\nBohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a\\nwoman’s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I\\nhave not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or\\nwhen he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of\\nthe woman.\\nAdventure 2.\\nThe Red-headed League.\\nI had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn\\nof last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, floridfaced,\\nelderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my\\nintrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into\\nthe room and closed the door behind me.\\n“You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,” he\\nsaid cordially.\\n“I was afraid that you were engaged.”\\n“So I am. Very much so.”\\n“Then I can wait in the next room.”\\n“Not at all.This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in\\nmany of my most successful cases, and I have\\n 39\\nno doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.”\\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting,\\nwith a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.\\n“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his\\nfingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “I know, my\\ndear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the\\nconventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your\\nrelish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if\\nyou will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own\\nlittle adventures.”\\n“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,”\\nI observed.\\n“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just be\\nfore we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss\\nMary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary\\ncombinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more\\ndaring than any effort of the imagination.”\\n“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.” “You did, Doctor, but\\nnone the less you must come round\\nto my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact\\non you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to\\nbe right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been\\ngood enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a\\nnarrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have\\nlistened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and\\nmost unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the\\nsmaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt\\nwhether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard it is\\nimpossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or\\nnot, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have\\never listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to\\nrecommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr.\\nWatson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature\\nof the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.\\nAs a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events,\\nI am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which\\noccur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to\\nadmit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.” The portly client\\npuffed out his chest with an appearance\\nof some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper\\nfrom the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down\\nthe advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and\\nthe paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at\\nthe man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion,\\nto read the indications which might be presented by his dress\\nor appearance.\\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our\\n 41\\nvisitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British\\ntradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey\\nshepherd’s check trousers, a not over-clean black frockcoat, unbuttoned in\\nthe front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a\\nsquare pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat\\nand a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair\\nbeside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable\\nabout the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme\\nchagrin and discontent upon his features.\\nSherlock Holmes’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head\\nwith a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the obvious\\nfacts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that\\nhe is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a\\nconsiderable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”\\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper,\\nbut his eyes upon my companion.\\n“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?” he\\nasked. “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It’s as\\ntrue as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”\\n“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your\\nleft. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.”\\n“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”\\n“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially\\nas, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass\\nbreastpin.”\\n“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”\\n“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches,\\nand the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it\\nupon the desk?”\\n“Well, but China?”\\n“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could\\nonly have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks\\nand have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of\\nstaining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China.\\nWhen, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the\\nmatter becomes even more simple.”\\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he. “I thought at\\nfirst that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in\\nit, after all.”\\n“I begin to think, Watson,” said Holmes, “that I make a mistake in\\nexplaining. ‘Omne ignotum pro magnifico,’ you know, and my poor little\\nreputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not\\nfind the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?”\\n“Yes, I have got it now,” he answered with his thick red finger planted\\nhalfway down the column. “Here it is. This is what began it all. You just\\nread it for yourself, sir.”\\n 43\\nI took the paper from him and read as follows: “TO THE RED-HEADED\\nLEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of\\nLebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which\\nentitles a member of the League to a salary of 4 pounds a week for purely\\nnominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and\\nabove the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on\\nMonday, at eleven o’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7\\nPope’s Court, Fleet Street.”\\n“What on earth does this mean?” I ejaculated after I had twice read over the\\nextraordinary announcement.\\nHolmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high\\nspirits. “It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?” said he. “And now, Mr.\\nWilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household,\\nand the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will\\nfirst make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date.”\\n“It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.”\\n“Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?”\\n“Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said\\nJabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; “I have a small pawnbroker’s business\\nat Coburg Square, near the City. It’s not a very large affair, and of late years\\nit has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two\\nassistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but\\nthat he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business.”\\n“What is the name of this obliging youth?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n“His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either. It’s hard\\nto say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I\\nknow very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able\\nto give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his\\nhead?”\\n“Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employé who comes\\nunder the full market price. It is not a common experience among\\nemployers in this age. I don’t know that your assistant is not as remarkable\\nas your advertisement.”\\n“Oh, he has his faults, too,” said Mr. Wilson. “Never was such a fellow for\\nphotography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving\\nhis mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to\\ndevelop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he’s a good\\nworker. There’s no vice in him.”\\n“He is still with you, I presume?”\\n“Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and\\nkeeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a widower\\nand never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we\\nkeep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.\\n 45\\n“The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came\\ndown into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his\\nhand, and he says:\\n“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’\\n“‘Why that?’ I asks.\\n“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed\\nMen. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I\\nunderstand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the\\ntrustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money. If my hair would\\nonly change colour, here’s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.’\\n“‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-athome\\nman, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it,\\nI was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that\\nway I didn’t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always\\nglad of a bit of news.\\n“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked\\nwith his eyes open.\\n“‘Never.’\\n“‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the\\nvacancies.’\\n“‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.\\n“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need\\nnot interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’\\n“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the\\nbusiness has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of\\nhundred would have been very handy.\\n“‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.\\n“‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for yourself\\nthat the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should\\napply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by\\nan American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his\\nways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all redheaded\\nmen; so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous\\nfortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the\\nproviding of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear\\nit is splendid pay and very little to do.’\\n“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would\\napply.’\\n“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘You see it is really\\nconfined to Londoners, and to grown men.This American had started from\\nLondon when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.\\nThen, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red,\\nor dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared\\nto apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly\\nbe worth your while to put yourself out of\\n 47\\nthe way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’\\n“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves,\\nthat my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to\\nme that if there was to be any competition in the matter I\\nstood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent\\nSpaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he\\nmight prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters\\nfor the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a\\nholiday, so we shut the business up and started\\noff for the address that was given us in the advertisement. “I never hope to\\nsee such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes.\\nFrom north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade\\nof red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.\\nFleet Street was choked with red-headed folk,\\nand Pope’s Court looked like a coster’s orange barrow. I should\\nnot have thought there were so many in the whole country as\\nwere brought together by that single advertisement. Every\\nshade of colour they were—straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irishsetter, liver,\\nclay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many\\nwho had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how\\nmany were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but\\nSpaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not\\nimagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me\\nthrough the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the\\noffice. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going\\nup in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in\\nas well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.” “Your\\nexperience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes as his\\nclient paused and refreshed his memory\\nwith a huge pinch of snuff. “Pray continue your very interesting statement.”\\n“There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden\\nchairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a\\nhead that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to\\neach candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to\\nfind some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting\\na vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all.\\nHowever, when our turn came the little man was much more\\nfavourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the\\ndoor as we entered, so that he might have a private word with\\nus.\\n“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is\\nwilling to fill a vacancy in the League.’\\n“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He\\nhas every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.’\\nHe took a step backward, cocked his head on\\none side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then\\nsuddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me\\nwarmly on my success.\\n“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am sure,\\nexcuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’\\nWith that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged\\n 49\\nuntil I yelled with the pain. ‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he as he\\nreleased me. ‘I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful,\\nfor we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you\\ntales of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He\\nstepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice\\nthat the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from\\nbelow, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was\\nnot a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\\n“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the\\npensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married\\nman, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’\\n“I answered that I had not.\\n“His face fell immediately.\\n“‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I\\nam sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation\\nand spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is\\nexceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’\\n“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to\\nhave the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he\\nsaid that it would be all right.\\n“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but we must\\nstretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When\\nshall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’\\n“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I.\\n“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding. ‘I should\\nbe able to look after that for you.’\\n“‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.\\n“‘Ten to two.’\\n“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes,\\nespecially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it\\nwould suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew\\nthat my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that\\nturned up.\\n“‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’\\n“‘Is 4 pounds a week.’\\n“‘And the work?’\\n“‘Is purely nominal.’\\n“‘What do you call purely nominal?’\\n“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole\\ntime. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very\\nclear upon that point. You don’t comply with the conditions if you budge\\nfrom the office during that time.’\\n“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said I.\\n“‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross; ‘neither sickness nor\\nbusiness nor anything else. There you must stay, or\\n 51\\nyou lose your billet.’\\n“‘And the work?’\\n“‘Is to copy out the “Encyclopaedia Britannica.” There is\\nthe first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and\\nblotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready tomorrow?’\\n“‘Certainly,’ I answered.\\n“‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once\\nmore on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to\\ngain.’ He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant,\\nhardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good\\nfortune.\\n“Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits\\nagain; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some\\ngreat hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It\\nseemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that\\nthey would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the\\n‘Encyclopaedia Britannica.’ Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer\\nme up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing.\\nHowever, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I\\nbought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of\\nfoolscap paper, I started off for Pope’s Court.\\n“Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.The\\ntable was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I\\ngot fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me;\\nbut he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At\\ntwo o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I\\nhad written, and locked the door of the office after me.\\n“This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager\\ncame in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work. It\\nwas the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was\\nthere at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross\\ntook to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not\\ncome in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an\\ninstant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a\\ngood one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.\\n“Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and\\nArchery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence\\nthat I might get on to the B’s before very long. It cost me something in\\nfoolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then\\nsuddenly the whole business came to an end.”\\n“To an end?”\\n“Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten\\no’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard\\nhammered on to the middle\\n 53\\nof the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself.”\\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of notepaper.\\nIt read in this fashion:\\nTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS\\nDISSOLVED.\\nOctober 9, 1890.\\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face\\nbehind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped\\nevery other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.\\n“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client, flushing up\\nto the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothing better than laugh at\\nme, I can go elsewhere.”\\n“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had\\nhalf risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. It is most\\nrefreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so,\\nsomething just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when\\nyou found the card upon the door?”\\n“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices\\nround, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went\\nto the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and I asked\\nhim if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He\\nsaid that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr.\\nDuncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.\\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’\\n“‘What, the red-headed man?’\\n“‘Yes.’\\n“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a\\nsolicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new\\npremises were ready. He moved out yesterday.’ “‘Where could I find him?’\\n“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward\\nStreet, near St. Paul’s.’\\n“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a\\nmanufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either\\nMr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”\\n“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.\\n“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant.\\nBut he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I\\nshould hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did\\nnot wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you\\nwere good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I\\ncame right away to you.”\\n“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an exceedingly\\nremarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have\\ntold me I think that it is possible that\\n 55\\ngraver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.” “Grave\\nenough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost\\nfour pound a week.”\\n“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes,\\n“I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league.\\nOn the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer\\nby some 30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge\\nwhich you have gained on every subject which comes under\\nthe letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”\\n“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they\\nare, and what their object was in playing this prank—if it was\\na prank—upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for\\nit cost them two and thirty pounds.”\\n“We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And,\\nfirst, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours\\nwho first called your attention to the advertisement—how long\\nhad he been with you?”\\n“About a month then.”\\n“How did he come?”\\n“In answer to an advertisement.”\\n“Was he the only applicant?”\\n“No, I had a dozen.”\\n“Why did you pick him?”\\n“Because he was handy and would come cheap.” “At half-wages, in fact.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”\\n“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his\\nface, though he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid\\nupon his forehead.”\\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I\\nthought as much,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his\\nears are pierced for earrings?”\\n“Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when\\nhe was a lad.”\\n“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is\\nstill with you?”\\n“Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.”\\n“And has your business been attended to in your absence?” “Nothing to\\ncomplain of, sir. There’s never very much to do\\nof a morning.”\\n“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an\\nopinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day\\nis Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a\\nconclusion.”\\n“Well, Watson,” said Holmes when our visitor had left us,\\n“what do you make of it all?”\\n“I make nothing of it,” I answered frankly. “It is a most\\nmysterious business.”\\n“As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the\\nless mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes\\nwhich are really puzzling, just as a common\\n 57\\nplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this\\nmatter.”\\n“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.\\n“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that\\nyou won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up in his chair,\\nwith his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his\\neyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some\\nstrange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and\\nindeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with\\nthe gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon\\nthe mantelpiece.\\n“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked. “What\\ndo you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?”\\n“I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.”\\n“Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we\\ncan have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of\\nGerman music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than\\nItalian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!”\\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk\\ntook us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we\\nhad listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place,\\nwhere four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small\\nrailed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded\\nlaurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial\\natmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with “JABEZ WILSON” in\\nwhite letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our redheaded\\nclient carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it\\nwith his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining\\nbrightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and\\nthen down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he\\nreturned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the\\npavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and\\nknocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young\\nfellow, who asked him to step in.\\n“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go\\nfrom here to the Strand.”\\n“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\\n“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He is, in my\\njudgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure\\nthat he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.”\\n“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in this\\nmystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way\\nmerely in order that you might see him.”\\n 59\\n“Not him.”\\n“What then?”\\n“The knees of his trousers.”\\n“And what did you see?”\\n“What I expected to see.”\\n“Why did you beat the pavement?”\\n“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk.\\nWe are spies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg\\nSquare. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”\\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from\\nthe retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the\\nfront of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which\\nconveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was\\nblocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide\\ninward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying\\nswarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of\\nfine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the\\nother side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\\n“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the\\nline, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a\\nhobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer’s,\\nthe tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City\\nand Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane’s\\ncarriagebuilding depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now,\\nDoctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had some play. A sandwich\\nand a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and\\ndelicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with\\ntheir conundrums.”\\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very\\ncapable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he\\nsat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his\\nlong, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his\\nlanguid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuthhound,\\nHolmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was\\npossible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately\\nasserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I\\nhave often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood\\nwhich occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him\\nfrom extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was\\nnever so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in\\nhis armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it\\nwas that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his\\nbrilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those\\nwho were unacquainted with his meth\\n 61\\nods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that\\nof other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music\\nat St. James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those\\nwhom he had set himself to hunt down.\\n“You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,” he remarked as we emerged.\\n“Yes, it would be as well.”\\n“And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business\\nat Coburg Square is serious.”\\n“Why serious?”\\n“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe\\nthat we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather\\ncomplicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”\\n“At what time?”\\n“Ten will be early enough.”\\n“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”\\n“Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly\\nput your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand, turned on his\\nheel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always\\noppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock\\nHolmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen,\\nand yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had\\nhappened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business\\nwas still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in\\nKensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the redheaded\\ncopier of the “Encyclopaedia” down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg\\nSquare, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What\\nwas this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we\\ngoing, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this\\nsmooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man— a man who\\nmight play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and\\nset the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.\\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way\\nacross the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms\\nwere standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of\\nvoices from above. On entering his room I found Holmes in animated\\nconversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the\\nofficial police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sadfaced man, with a\\nvery shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\\n“Ha! Our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and\\ntaking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I think you know Mr.\\nJones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is\\nto be our com\\n 63\\npanion in to-night’s adventure.”\\n“We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,” said Jones\\nin his consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man\\nfor starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to\\ndo the running down.”\\n“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our\\nchase,” observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\\n“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes,\\nsir,” said the police agent loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are,\\nif he won’t mind my saying so, just a little too\\ntheoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective\\nin him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that\\nbusiness of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has\\nbeen more nearly correct than the official force.”\\n“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger\\nwith deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the\\nfirst Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have\\nnot had my rubber.”\\n“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you\\nwill play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done\\nyet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr.\\nMerryweather, the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for\\nyou, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your\\nhands.”\\n“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a\\nyoung man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I\\nwould rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London.\\nHe’s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal\\nduke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning\\nas his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never\\nknow where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one\\nweek, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.\\nI’ve been on his track for years\\nand have never set eyes on him yet.”\\n“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you tonight. I’ve had\\none or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay,\\nand I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It\\nis past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two\\nwill take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the\\nsecond.”\\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the\\nlong drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which\\nhe had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless\\nlabyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington\\nStreet.\\n“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather\\nis a bank director, and personally interested\\nin the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also.\\nHe is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He\\nhas one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog\\nand as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone.\\n 65\\nHere we are, and they are waiting for us.”\\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\\nourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the\\nguidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and\\nthrough a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small\\ncorridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened,\\nand led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another\\nformidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then\\nconducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a\\nthird door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates\\nand massive boxes.\\n“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked as he held up\\nthe lantern and gazed about him.\\n“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags\\nwhich lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he remarked,\\nlooking up in surprise.\\n“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes severely. “You\\nhave already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg\\nthat you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and\\nnot to interfere?”\\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\\ninjured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the\\nfloor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine\\nminutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy\\nhim, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\\n“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they can hardly take\\nany steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose\\na minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have\\nfor their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no doubt you have divined\\n—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr.\\nMerryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that\\nthere are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a\\nconsiderable interest in this cellar at present.”\\n“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several\\nwarnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\\n“Your French gold?”\\n“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\\nborrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has\\nbecome known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and\\nthat it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000\\nnapoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is\\nmuch larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the\\ndirectors have had misgivings upon the subject.”\\n“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time\\nthat we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will\\ncome to a head. In the meantime\\n 67\\nMr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.”\\n“And sit in the dark?”\\n“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought\\nthat, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your rubber after all. But I\\nsee that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the\\npresence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These\\nare daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may\\ndo us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and\\ndo you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon\\nthem, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about\\nshooting them down.”\\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\\nwhich I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and\\nleft us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never before\\nexperienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was\\nstill there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To me, with my nerves\\nworked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and\\nsubduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\\n“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through the\\nhouse into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked\\nyou, Jones?”\\n“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”\\n“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.”\\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour\\nand a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone\\nand the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I\\nfeared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest\\npitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the\\ngentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper,\\nheavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank\\ndirector. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the\\nfloor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened\\nout until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a\\ngash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand,\\nwhich felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more\\nthe hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was\\nwithdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the\\nsingle lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing\\nsound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a\\nsquare, gaping hole, through which\\n 69\\nstreamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,\\nboyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either\\nside of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one\\nknee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole\\nand was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a\\npale face and a shock of very red hair.\\n“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags? Great\\nScott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”\\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The\\nother dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones\\nclutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but\\nHolmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and the pistol clinked\\nupon the stone floor.\\n“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You have no chance at all.”\\n“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that my\\npal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”\\n“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.\\n“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must\\ncompliment you.”\\n“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and\\neffective.”\\n“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at climbing\\ndown holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”\\n“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our\\nprisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not be aware\\nthat I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you\\naddress me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”\\n“All right,” said Jones with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you please,\\nsir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the\\npolice-station?”\\n“That is better,” said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the\\nthree of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\\n“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from\\nthe cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There\\nis no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete\\nmanner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever\\ncome within my experience.”\\n“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John\\nClay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this matter,\\nwhich I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid\\nby having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing\\nthe very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”\\n 71\\n“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat\\nover a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was perfectly obvious\\nfrom the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of\\nthe advertisement of the League, and the copying of the ‘Encyclopaedia,’\\nmust be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number\\nof hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would\\nbe difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to\\nClay’s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice’s hair. The 4 pounds\\na week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were\\nplaying for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the\\ntemporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and\\ntogether they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week.\\nFrom the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it\\nwas obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the\\nsituation.”\\n“But how could you guess what the motive was?” “Had there been women\\nin the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however,\\nwas out of the question. The man’s business was a small one, and there was\\nnothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations,\\nand such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of\\nthe house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for\\nphotography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There\\nwas the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious\\nassistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most\\ndaring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar—\\nsomething which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it\\nbe, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to\\nsome other building.\\n“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you\\nby beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the\\ncellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the\\nbell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some\\nskirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly\\nlooked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself\\nhave remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of\\nthose hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were\\nburrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank\\nabutted on our friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem.\\nWhen you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and\\nupon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”\\n“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” I\\nasked.\\n“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a\\n 73\\nsign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other\\nwords, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they\\nshould use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be\\nremoved. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would\\ngive them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them\\nto come to-night.”\\n“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. “It\\nis so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”\\n“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I already feel it\\nclosing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the\\ncommonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.”\\n“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,”\\nhe remarked. “‘L’homme c’est rien—l’oeuvre c’est tout,’ as Gustave\\nFlaubert wrote to George Sand.”\\nAdventure 3.\\nA Case of Identity.\\n“My dear fellow,” said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire\\nin his lodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely stranger than anything\\nwhich the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the\\nthings which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly\\nout of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove\\nthe roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange\\ncoincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of\\nevents, working through generations, and leading to the most outré results,\\nit would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions\\nmost stale and unprofitable.”\\n“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The cases\\n 75\\nwhich come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar\\nenough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits,\\nand yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.”\\n“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic\\neffect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police report, where more\\nstress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the\\ndetails, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter.\\nDepend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.”\\nI smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand your thinking so.” I\\nsaid. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to\\neverybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are\\nbrought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here”—I picked\\nup the morning paper from the ground—”let us put it to a practical test.\\nHere is the first heading upon which I come. ‘A husband’s cruelty to his\\nwife.’ There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is\\nall perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink,\\nthe push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The\\ncrudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.”\\n“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,” said\\nHolmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This is the Dundas\\nseparation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small\\npoints in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no\\nother woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into\\nthe habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling\\nthem at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to\\nthe imagination of the average storyteller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor,\\nand acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.”\\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of\\nthe lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple\\nlife that I could not help commenting upon it.\\n“Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little\\nsouvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case\\nof the Irene Adler papers.”\\n“And the ring?” I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled\\nupon his finger.\\n“It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I\\nserved them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who\\nhave been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.”\\n“And have you any on hand just now?” I asked with interest.\\n“Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They\\nare important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have\\nfound that it is usually in unimpor\\n 77\\ntant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick\\nanalysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The\\nlarger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more\\nobvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate\\nmatter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing\\nwhich presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may\\nhave something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of\\nmy clients, or I am much mistaken.”\\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds\\ngazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his\\nshoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman\\nwith a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a\\nbroadbrimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire\\nfashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a\\nnervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated\\nbackward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons.\\nSuddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she\\nhurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\\n“I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his cigarette\\ninto the fire. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de\\ncoeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too\\ndelicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When\\na woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and\\nthe usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a\\nlove matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or\\ngrieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.”\\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to\\nannounce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his\\nsmall black figure like a fullsailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat.\\nSherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was\\nremarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he\\nlooked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar\\nto him.\\n“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little trying to\\ndo so much typewriting?”\\n“I did at first,” she answered, “but now I know where the letters are without\\nlooking.” Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a\\nviolent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad,\\ngood-humoured face. “You’ve heard about me, Mr. Holmes,” she cried,\\n“else how could you know all that?”\\n“Never mind,” said Holmes, laughing; “it is my business to know things.\\nPerhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why\\nshould you come to consult me?”\\n“I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose\\nhusband you found so easy when the police\\n 79\\nand everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you\\nwould do as much for me. I’m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in\\nmy own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would\\ngive it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\n“Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked Sherlock\\nHolmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary\\nSutherland. “Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said, “for it made me\\nangry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank—that is, my father—\\ntook it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and\\nso at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm\\ndone, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to\\nyou.”\\n“Your father,” said Holmes, “your stepfather, surely, since the name is\\ndifferent.”\\n“Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is\\nonly five years and two months older than myself.”\\n“And your mother is alive?”\\n“Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when\\nshe married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was nearly\\nfifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham\\nCourt Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried\\non with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made\\nher sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.\\nThey got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn’t near as\\nmuch as father could have got if he had been alive.”\\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and\\ninconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the\\ngreatest concentration of attention.\\n“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”\\n“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in\\nAuckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per cent. Two thousand\\nfive hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.”\\n“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw so large a\\nsum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt\\ntravel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady\\ncan get on very nicely upon an income of about 60 pounds.”\\n“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that\\nas long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and so they\\nhave the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that\\nis only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and\\n 81\\npays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn\\nat typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from\\nfifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”\\n“You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes. “This is my\\nfriend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself.\\nKindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at the\\nfringe of her jacket. “I met him first at the gasfitters’ ball,” she said. “They\\nused to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they\\nremembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to\\ngo. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I\\nwanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on\\ngoing, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk\\nwere not fit for us to know, when all father’s friends were to be there. And\\nhe said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had\\nnever so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would\\ndo, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went,\\nmother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there\\nI met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\n“I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back from\\nFrance he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”\\n“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and\\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a\\nwoman, for she would have her way.”\\n“I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman\\ncalled Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\n“Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got\\nhome all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met\\nhim twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer\\nAngel could not come to the house any more.”\\n“No?”\\n“Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort. He wouldn’t have\\nany visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be\\nhappy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a\\nwoman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.”\\n“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?”\\n“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote\\nand said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had\\ngone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I\\ntook the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.”\\n“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”\\n“Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took.\\nHosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office\\n 83\\nin Leadenhall Street—and—”\\n“What office?”\\n“That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t know.” “Where did he live,\\nthen?”\\n“He slept on the premises.”\\n“And you don’t know his address?”\\n“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”\\n“Where did you address your letters, then?”\\n“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called\\nfor. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all\\nthe other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite\\nthem, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said that when I\\nwrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten\\nhe always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show\\nyou how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would\\nthink of.”\\n“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an axiom of mine\\nthat the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember\\nany other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\\n“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the\\nevening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous.\\nVery retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He’d had\\nthe quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had\\nleft him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech.\\nHe was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak,\\njust as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.”\\n“Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned\\nto France?”\\n“Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should\\nmarry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me\\nswear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would\\nalways be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear,\\nand that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the\\nfirst and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of\\nmarrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said\\nnever to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said\\nshe would make it all right with him. I didn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It\\nseemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older\\nthan me; but I didn’t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at\\nBordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came\\nback to me on the very morning of the wedding.”\\n“It missed him, then?”\\n“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”\\n“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged,\\n 85\\nthen, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?”\\n“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near\\nKing’s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the\\nSt. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as\\nthere were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself\\ninto a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab\\nin the street. We got to the church first, and when the fourwheeler drove up\\nwe waited for him to step out, but he never\\ndid, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked\\nthere was no one there! The cabman said that he could not\\nimagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in\\nwith his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I\\nhave never seen or heard anything since then to throw any\\nlight upon what became of him.”\\n“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,”\\nsaid Holmes.\\n“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so.\\nWhy, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to\\nbe true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us,\\nI was always to remember\\nthat I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge\\nsooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning,\\nbut what has happened since gives a meaning to it.” “Most certainly it does.\\nYour own opinion is, then, that some\\nunforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?”\\n“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have\\ntalked so. And then I think that what he fore\\nsaw happened.”\\n“But you have no notion as to what it could have been?” “None.”\\n“One more question. How did your mother take the matter?”\\n“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the\\nmatter again.”\\n“And your father? Did you tell him?”\\n“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had\\nhappened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said,\\nwhat interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors\\nof the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed\\nmy money, or if he had married me and got my money settled\\non him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very\\nindependent about money and never would look at a shilling\\nof mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could\\nhe not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I\\ncan’t sleep a wink at night.” She pulled a little handkerchief\\nout of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.\\n“I shall glance into the case for you,” said Holmes, rising,\\n“and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result.\\nLet the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let\\nyour mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr.\\nHosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from\\nyour life.”\\n 87\\n“Then you don’t think I’ll see him again?”\\n“I fear not.”\\n“Then what has happened to him?”\\n“You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an\\naccurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.”\\n“I advertised for him in last Saturday’s Chronicle,” said she. “Here is the\\nslip and here are four letters from him.”\\n“Thank you. And your address?”\\n“No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.”\\n“Mr. Angel’s address you never had, I understand. Where is your father’s\\nplace of business?”\\n“He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of\\nFenchurch Street.”\\n“Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the\\npapers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the\\nwhole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.”\\n“You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to\\nHosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.”\\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something\\nnoble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She\\nlaid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a\\npromise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed\\ntogether, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward\\nto the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe,\\nwhich was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his\\nchair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look\\nof infinite languor in his face.\\n“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I found her more\\ninteresting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one.\\nYou will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in ’77, and\\nthere was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea,\\nhowever, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the\\nmaiden herself was most instructive.”\\n“You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to\\nme,” I remarked.\\n“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and\\nso you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the\\nimportance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues\\nthat may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that\\nwoman’s appearance? Describe it.”\\n“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of\\na brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a\\nfringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than\\ncoffee colour,\\n 89\\nwith a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish\\nand were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn’t observe.\\nShe had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly\\nwell-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”\\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\\n“‘Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have\\nreally done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of\\nimportance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for\\ncolour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself\\nupon details. My first glance is always at a woman’s sleeve. In a man it is\\nperhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this\\nwoman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for\\nshowing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the\\ntypewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined.The sewingmachine,\\nof the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm,\\nand on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across\\nthe broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the\\ndint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short\\nsight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.”\\n“It surprised me.”\\n“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on\\nglancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing\\nwere not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a\\nslightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only\\nin the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and\\nfifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has\\ncome away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great\\ndeduction to say that she came away in a hurry.”\\n“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my\\nfriend’s incisive reasoning.\\n“I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but\\nafter being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the\\nforefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were\\nstained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too\\ndeep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear\\nupon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go\\nback to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised\\ndescription of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\\nI held the little printed slip to the light.\\n“Missing,” it said, “on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named\\nHosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow\\ncomplexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black sidewhiskers\\nand moustache;\\n 91\\ntinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in\\nblack frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and\\ngrey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots.\\nKnown to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody\\nbringing—”\\n“That will do,” said Holmes. “As to the letters,” he continued, glancing\\nover them, “they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr.\\nAngel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point,\\nhowever, which will no doubt strike you.”\\n“They are typewritten,” I remarked.\\n“Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little\\n‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no\\nsuperscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point\\nabout the signature is very suggestive —in fact, we may call it conclusive.”\\n“Of what?”\\n“My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the\\ncase?”\\n“I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his\\nsignature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.”\\n“No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should\\nsettle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady’s\\nstepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six\\no’clock tomorrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with\\nthe male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to\\nthose letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the\\ninterim.”\\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of\\nreasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have\\nsome solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he\\ntreated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once\\nonly had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the\\nIrene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the\\nSign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study\\nin Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not\\nunravel. I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the\\nconviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he\\nheld in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the\\ndisappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the\\ntime, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It\\nwas not until close upon six o’clock that I found myself free and was able to\\nspring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be\\ntoo late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock\\nHolmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form\\n 93\\ncurled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and\\ntest-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that\\nhe had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\\n“Well, have you solved it?” I asked as I entered. “Yes. It was the bisulphate\\nof baryta.”\\n“No, no, the mystery!” I cried.\\n“Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working\\nupon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said\\nyesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that\\nthere is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.”\\n“Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?”\\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened\\nhis lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at\\nthe door.\\n“This is the girl’s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “He has\\nwritten to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!”\\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years\\nof age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner,\\nand a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a\\nquestioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the\\nsideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\\n“Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “I think that this\\ntypewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me\\nfor six o’clock?”\\n“Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own\\nmaster, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about\\nthis little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in\\npublic. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very\\nexcitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily\\ncontrolled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not\\nmind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it\\nis not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides,\\nit is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer\\nAngel?”\\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes quietly; “I have every reason to believe that\\nI will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. “I am delighted\\nto hear it,” he said.\\n“It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a typewriter has really quite\\nas much individuality as a man’s handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no\\ntwo of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others,\\nand some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr.\\nWindibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over\\n 95\\nof the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the ‘r.’ There are fourteen other\\ncharacteristics, but those are the more obvious.”\\n“We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt\\nit is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his\\nbright little eyes.\\n“And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.\\nWindibank,” Holmes continued. “I think of writing another little\\nmonograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It\\nis a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four\\nletters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all\\ntypewritten. In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and the ‘r’s’ tailless,\\nbut you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the\\nfourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.”\\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. “I cannot\\nwaste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,” he said. “If you can\\ncatch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.”\\n“Certainly,” said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. “I\\nlet you know, then, that I have caught him!”\\n“What! where?” shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and\\nglancing about him like a rat in a trap.\\n“Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,” said Holmes suavely. “There is no\\npossible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it\\nwas a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to\\nsolve so simple a question. That’s right! Sit down and let us talk it over.”\\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of\\nmoisture on his brow. “It—it’s not actionable,” he stammered.\\n“I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it\\nwas as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came\\nbefore me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will\\ncontradict me if I go wrong.”\\nThe man sat huddled up in h is chair, with his head sunk upon his breast,\\nlike one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of\\nthe mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began\\ntalking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\\n“The man married a woman very much older tha n himself for her money,”\\nsaid he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she\\nlived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and\\nthe loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to\\npreserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but\\naffectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with\\nher fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be\\nallowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course,\\nthe loss of a hundred a\\n97\\nyear, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious\\ncourse of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of\\npeople of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer\\nforever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced\\nher positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever\\nstepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to\\nhis heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised\\nhimself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a\\nmoustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an\\ninsinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short sight,\\nhe appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love\\nhimself.”\\n“It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “We never thought that she\\nwould have been so carried away.”\\n“Very likely not. However that ma y be, the young lady was very decidedly\\ncarried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in\\nFrance, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind.\\nShe was flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was\\nincreased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr.\\nAngel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as\\nfar as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings,\\nand an engagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from\\nturning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up\\nforever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The\\nthing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic\\nmanner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady’s\\nmind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to\\ncome. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence\\nalso the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very\\nmorning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so\\nbound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to\\ncome, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church\\ndoor he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently\\nvanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler\\nand out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!”\\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes h ad\\nbeen talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale\\nface.\\n“It m ay be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but if you are so very\\nsharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking\\nthe law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but\\nas long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for\\nassault and illegal constraint.”\\n“The law cannot, as you say, to uch you,” said Holmes,\\n99\\nunlocking and throwing open the door, “yet there never was a man who\\ndeserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he\\nought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing\\nup at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not part of my\\nduties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just\\ntreat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could\\ngrasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door\\nbanged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running\\nat the top of his speed down the road.\\n“There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said Holmes, laughing, as he threw\\nhimself down into his chair once more. “That fellow will rise from crime to\\ncrime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case\\nhas, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”\\n“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” I remarked.\\n“Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer A ngel\\nmust have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally\\nclear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we\\ncould see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never\\ntogether, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was\\nsuggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both\\nhinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all\\nconfirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of\\ncourse, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would\\nrecognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts,\\ntogether with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.”\\n“And how did you verify them?”\\n“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the\\nfirm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I\\neliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise—the\\nwhiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that\\nthey would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their\\ntravellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I\\nwrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would\\ncome here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same\\ntrivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from\\nWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description\\ntallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank. Voilà\\ntout!”\\n“And Miss Sutherland?”\\n“If I tell her she will no t believe me. You may remember the old Persian\\nsaying, ‘There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also\\nfor whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ There is as much sense in\\nHafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.”\\nAdventure 4.\\nThe Boscombe Valley Mystery.\\nWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid\\nbrought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:\\n“Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the\\nwest of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad\\nif you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the\\n11:15.”\\n“What do you say, dear?” said my wife, looking across at me. “Will you\\ngo?”\\n“I rea lly don’t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.”\\n“Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been lookin g a little\\npale lately. I think that the change would\\n101 do you good, and you are al ways so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes’\\ncases.”\\n“I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of\\nthem,” I answered. “But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only\\nhalf an hour.”\\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of\\nmaking me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so\\nthat in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away\\nto Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the\\nplatform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey\\ntravelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\\n“It is really very good of you to come, Watson,” said he. “It makes a\\nconsiderable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can\\nthoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you\\nwill keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.”\\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which\\nHolmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with\\nintervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading.\\nThen he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up\\nonto the rack.\\n“Have you heard anything of the case?” he asked. “Not a word. I have not\\nseen a paper for some days.” “The London press has not had very full\\naccounts. I have\\n103\\njust been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the\\nparticulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases\\nwhich are so extremely difficult.”\\n“That sounds a little paradoxical.”\\n“But it is profoundly true. Singula rity is almost invariably a clue. The more\\nfeatureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it\\nhome. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case\\nagainst the son of the murdered man.”\\n“It is a murder, then?”\\n“Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have\\nthe opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of\\nthings to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few\\nwords.\\n“Bosco mbe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\\nHerefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John\\nTurner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to\\nthe old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let\\nto Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian.The men had\\nknown each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when\\nthey came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible.\\nTurner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but\\nstill remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were\\nfrequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner\\nhad an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living.\\nThey appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English\\nfamilies and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond\\nof sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the\\nneighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a man and a girl. Turner had\\na considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I\\nhave been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.\\n“On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his hous e at Hatherley\\nabout three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which\\nis a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down\\nthe Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning\\nat Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an\\nappointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he\\nnever came back alive.\\n“From Hatherley Farm -house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,\\nand two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old\\nwoman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder,\\na game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose\\nthat Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a\\nfew minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr.\\nJames McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best\\nof his belief, the father was\\n105\\nactually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no\\nmore of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had\\noccurred.\\n“The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the\\ngame-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded\\nround, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of\\nfourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the\\nBoscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She\\nstates that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close\\nby the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having\\na violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong\\nlanguage to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike\\nhis father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and\\ntold her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys\\nquarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were\\ngoing to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy\\ncame running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the\\nwood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited,\\nwithout either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were\\nobserved to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the\\ndead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been\\nbeaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries\\nwere such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his\\nson’s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the\\nbody. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and\\na verdict of ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday,\\nhe was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have\\nreferred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as\\nthey came out before the coroner and the police-court.”\\n“I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked. “If ever\\ncircumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.”\\n“Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered Holmes\\nthoughtfully. “It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you\\nshift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally\\nuncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be\\nconfessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the\\nyoung man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are\\nseveral people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss\\nTurner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his\\ninnocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in\\nconnection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest.\\nLestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is\\nthat two middleaged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour\\ninstead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.”\\n107\\n“I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious that you will find little\\ncredit to be gained out of this case.”\\n“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he answered,\\nlaughing. “Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts\\nwhich may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me\\ntoo well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or\\ndestroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or\\neven of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly\\nperceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and\\nyet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident\\na thing as that.”\\n“How on earth— ”\\n“My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which\\ncharacterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave\\nby the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get\\nfarther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get\\nround the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less\\nilluminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking\\nat himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only\\nquote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my\\nmétier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the\\ninvestigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which\\nwere brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.” “What\\nare they?”\\n“It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to\\nHatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he\\nwas a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it\\nwas no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect\\nof removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of\\nthe coroner’s jury.”\\n“It was a confession ,” I ejaculated.\\n“No, for it was followed by a prote station of innocence.”\\n“Coming on the top of such a damning series of event s, it was at least a\\nmost suspicious remark.”\\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes,“it is the brightest rift which I can at present\\nsee in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an\\nabsolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black\\nagainst him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned\\nindignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because\\nsuch surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and\\nyet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank\\nacceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a\\nman of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his\\ndeserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the\\ndead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day\\nso far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with\\n109\\nhim, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to\\nraise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are\\ndisplayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind\\nrather than of a guilty one.”\\nI shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,” I\\nremarked.\\n“So they h ave. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”\\n“What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”\\n“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his support ers, though there are\\none or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may\\nread it for yourself.”\\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and\\nhaving turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the\\nunfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I\\nsettled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully.\\nIt ran in this way:\\n“Mr. James McC arthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and\\ngave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at\\nBristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the\\n3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was\\ninformed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the\\ngroom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard,\\nand, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of\\nthe yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then\\ntook my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with\\nthe intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On\\nmy way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his\\nevidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I\\nhad no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from\\nthe pool I heard a cry of “Cooee!” which was a usual signal between my\\nfather and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the\\npool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather\\nroughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high\\nwords and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent\\ntemper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and\\nreturned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,\\nhowever, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run\\nback again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head\\nterribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost\\ninstantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my\\nway to Mr. Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for\\nassistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea\\nhow he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat\\ncold and forbidding in his man\\n111 ners, but he had, as far as I kn ow, no active enemies. I know nothing further\\nof the matter.’\\n“The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\\n“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to\\na rat.\\n“The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\\n“Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thoug ht that he was delirious.\\n“The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had t his\\nfinal quarrel?\\n“Witness: I sh ould prefer not to answer.\\n“The Coroner: I am afraid that I must pr ess it.\\n“Witness: It is really impossible for me to tel l you. I can assure you that it\\nhas nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\\n“The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you\\nthat your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any\\nfuture proceedings which may arise.\\n“Witness: I must still refuse.\\n“The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was a common signal\\nbetween you and your father?\\n“Witness: It was.\\n“The Coroner: H ow was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and\\nbefore he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\\n“Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know . “A Juryman: Did\\nyou see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on\\nhearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\\n“Witness: Nothing definite.\\n“The Coroner: What do you mean?\\n“Witness: I was so disturbed and ex cited as I rushed out into the open, that I\\ncould think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression\\nthat as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It\\nseemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid\\nperhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.\\n“‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’\\n“‘Yes, it was gone.’\\n“‘You cannot say w hat it was?’\\n“‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’\\n“‘How far from the body?’\\n“‘A dozen yards or so.’\\n“‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’\\n“‘About the same.’\\n“‘Then if it was rem oved it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?’\\n“‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’\\n“This concluded the examination of the witness.”\\n“I see,” said I as I glanced down the column, “tha t the coro\\n113\\nner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He\\ncalls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having\\nsignalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his\\nconversation with his father, and his singular account of his father’s dying\\nwords. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.”\\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the\\ncushioned seat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,” said\\nhe, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s favour. Don’t\\nyou see that you alternately give him credit for having too much\\nimagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of\\nquarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he\\nevolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying\\nreference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall\\napproach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is\\ntrue, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is\\nmy pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we\\nare on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be\\nthere in twenty minutes.”\\nIt was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the\\nbeautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found\\nourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man,\\nfurtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the\\nlight brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his\\nrustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland\\nYard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already\\nbeen engaged for us.\\n“I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. “I\\nknew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had\\nbeen on the scene of the crime.”\\n“It was very nice and complimentary of you,” Holmes answered. “It is\\nentirely a question of barometric pressure.”\\nLestrade looked startled. “I do not quite foll ow,” he said.\\n“How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky.\\nI have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very\\nmuch superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it\\nis probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.”\\nLestrade laughed indulgently. “You have, no d oubt, already formed your\\nconclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “The case is as plain as a\\npikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of\\ncourse, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has\\nheard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her\\nthat there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done.\\nWhy, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”\\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most\\nlovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes\\nshining, her lips parted, a pink flush\\n115 upon her cheeks, all thought o f her natural reserve lost in her overpowering\\nexcitement and concern.\\n“Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the other of us,\\nand finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion,\\n“I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know\\nthat James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work\\nknowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known\\neach other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else\\ndoes; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to\\nanyone who really knows him.”\\n“I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock\\nHolmes. “You may rely upon my doing all that I can.” “But you have read\\nthe evidence. You have formed some\\nconclusion? Do you not see some loo phole, some flaw? Do\\nyou not yourself think that he is innocent?”\\n“I think that it is very probable.”\\n“There, now!” she cried, throwi ng back her head and looking defiantly at\\nLestrade. “You hear! He gives me hopes.” Lestrade shrugged his shoulders.\\n“I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his\\nconclusions,” he\\nsaid.\\n“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never\\ndid it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure tha t the\\nreason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was\\nbecause I was concerned in it.”\\n“In what way?” asked Holmes.\\n“It is no time for me to hide any thing. James and his father\\nhad many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very\\nanxious that there should be a marriage between us. James a nd\\nI have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of\\ncourse he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and—\\nand—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that\\nyet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of\\nthem.”\\n“And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favour of such\\na union?”\\n“No, he w as averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy\\nwas in favour of it.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young\\nface as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at\\nher.\\n“Th ank you for this information,” said he. “May I see your\\nfather if I call to-morrow?”\\n“I am afraid the doctor won ’t allow it.”\\n“The doctor?”\\n“Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong\\nfor years back, but this has broken him down completely. He\\nhas taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck\\nand that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was\\nthe only man alive who had known dad in the old days in\\nVictoria.”\\n117\\n“Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”\\n“Yes, at the mines.”\\n“Quite so; at the gol d-mines, where, as I understand, Mr.\\nTurner made his money.”\\n“Yes, certainly.”\\n“Thank you, Mis s Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.”\\n“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to\\nthe prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know\\nhim to be innocent.”\\n“I will, Miss Turner.”\\n“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him.\\nGood-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.” She hurried from the\\nroom as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her\\ncarriage rattle off down the street.\\n“I am ashamed of you, Holmes, ” said Lestrade with dignity after a few\\nminutes’ silence. “Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to\\ndisappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.”\\n“I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy, ” said Holmes.\\n“Have you an order to see him in prison?”\\n“Yes, but only for you and me.”\\n“Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time\\nto take a train to Hereford and see him tonight?”\\n“Ample.”\\n“Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall\\nonly be away a couple of hours.”\\nI walked down to the station w ith them, and then wandered through the\\nstreets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the\\nsofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of\\nthe story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through\\nwhich we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually\\nfrom the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave\\nmyself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing\\nthat this unhappy young man’s story were absolutely true, then what hellish\\nthing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have\\noccurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment\\nwhen, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was\\nsomething terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the\\ninjuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called\\nfor the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the\\ninquest. In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of\\nthe left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been\\nshattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my\\nown head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That\\nwas to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he\\n119\\nwas face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the\\nolder man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be\\nworth while to call Holmes’ attention to it. Then there was the peculiar\\ndying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A\\nman dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it\\nwas more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what\\ncould it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation.\\nAnd then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that\\nwere true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress,\\npresumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to\\nreturn and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his\\nback turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and\\nimprobabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s opinion,\\nand yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that I could not\\nlose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of\\nyoung McCarthy’s innocence.\\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for\\nLestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\\n“The glass still keeps very high,” he remar ked as he sat down. “It is of\\nimportance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground.\\nOn the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such\\nnice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey.\\nI have seen young McCarthy.”\\n“And what did you learn from him?”\\n“Nothing.”\\n“Could he t hrow no light?”\\n“None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done\\nit and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as\\npuzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though\\ncomely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.”\\n“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is inde ed a fact that he was\\naverse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.”\\n“Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in\\nlove with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before\\nhe really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school,\\nwhat does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and\\nmarry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you\\ncan imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing\\nwhat he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely\\nimpossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands\\nup into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to\\npropose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting\\nhimself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would\\nhave thrown him over utterly\\n121\\nhad he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the\\nlast three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark\\nthat point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the\\nbarmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to\\nbe hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that\\nshe has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really\\nno tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young\\nMcCarthy for all that he has suffered.”\\n“But if he is innocent, who has done it?”\\n“Ah! who? I would call your attention v ery particularly to two points. One\\nis that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and\\nthat the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he\\ndid not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man\\nwas heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had returned. Those\\nare the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk\\nabout George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters\\nuntil to-morrow.”\\nThere was no rai n, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright\\nand cloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and\\nwe set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\\n“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observe d. “It is said that Mr.\\nTurner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”\\n“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.\\n“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and\\nhe has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very\\nbad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s, and, I may add, a\\ngreat benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm\\nrent free.”\\n“Indeed! T hat is interesting,” said Holmes.\\n“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he ha s helped him. Everybody about\\nhere speaks of his kindness to him.”\\n“Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who\\nappears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such\\nobligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner’s\\ndaughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very\\ncocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else\\nwould follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself\\nwas averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce\\nsomething from that?”\\n“We have got to the de ductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade, winking\\nat me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away\\nafter theories and fancies.”\\n“You are right,” said Holm es demurely; “you do find it very hard to tackle\\nthe facts.”\\n“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it\\n123\\ndifficult to get hold of,” replied Lestrade with some warmth. “And that is\\n—”\\n“Th at McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all\\ntheories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”\\n“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes, laughing. “But\\nI am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.”\\n“Yes, that is it.” It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, twostoried,\\nslate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey\\nwalls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a\\nstricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We\\ncalled at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’ request, showed us the boots\\nwhich her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son’s,\\nthough not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very\\ncarefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to\\nthe court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to\\nBoscombe Pool.\\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as\\nthis. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker\\nStreet would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened.\\nHis brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out\\nfrom beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his\\nshoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like\\nwhipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a\\npurely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely\\nconcentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell\\nunheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient\\nsnarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which\\nran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe\\nPool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were\\nmarks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which\\nbounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes\\nstop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade\\nand I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while\\nI watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that\\nevery one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.\\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty\\nyards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and\\nthe private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it\\nupon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked\\nthe site of the rich landowner’s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool\\nthe woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass\\ntwenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined\\nthe lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been\\nfound, and, indeed, so\\n125\\nmoist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left\\nby the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face\\nand peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled\\ngrass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned\\nupon my companion.\\n“What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\\n“I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other\\ntrace. But how on earth—”\\n“Oh, tut, tut! I have no tim e! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is\\nall over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the\\nreeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they\\ncame like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party\\nwith the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or\\neight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same\\nfeet.” He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better\\nview, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. “These are young\\nMcCarthy’s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the\\nsoles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his\\nstory. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the\\nfather’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end\\nof the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here?\\nTiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they\\ncome again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come\\nfrom?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track\\nuntil we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a\\ngreat beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to\\nthe farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little\\ncry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the\\nleaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an\\nenvelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark\\nof the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the\\nmoss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a\\npathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces\\nwere lost.\\n“It has be en a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning to his\\nnatural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge.\\nI think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a\\nlittle note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may\\nwalk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”\\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into\\nRoss, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in\\nthe wood.\\n“This may interest you, Lestrade,” he remarked, holding it out. “The murder\\nwas done with it.”\\n“I see no marks.”\\n127\\n“There are none.”\\n“How do you kno w, then?”\\n“The grass was growing un der it. It had only lain there a\\nfew days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It\\ncorresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.”\\n“And the murderer?”\\n“Is a tall man, left- handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled\\nshooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder,\\nand carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other\\nindications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.”\\nLestrade laughed. “I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,” he s aid. “Theories\\nare all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.”\\n“Nous verrons,” answered Holmes calmly. “You work your own me thod,\\nand I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably\\nreturn to London by the evening train.”\\n“And leave your case unfinished?”\\n“No, finished.”\\n“But the myster y?”\\n“It is solved.”\\n“Who was the criminal, then?”\\n“The gentleman I describe.”\\n“But who is he?”\\n“Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous\\nneighbourhood.”\\nLestrade shrugge d his shoulders. “I am a practical man,” he said, “and I\\nreally cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed\\ngentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland\\nYard.”\\n“All ri ght,” said Holmes quietly. “I have given you the chance. Here are\\nyour lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.”\\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, wher e we found\\nlunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained\\nexpression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.\\n“Look here, Watson,” he said when the cloth was cleared “just sit down in\\nthis chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don’t know quite what to\\ndo, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expound.”\\n“Pray do so.”\\n“Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young\\nMcCarthy’s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they\\nimpressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his\\nfather should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing him.\\nThe other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several\\nwords, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s ear. Now from\\nthis double point our research must commence,\\n129\\nand we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.”\\n“What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?”\\n“Well, obviously it could not h ave been meant for the son. The son, as far as\\nhe knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The\\n‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had\\nthe appointment with. But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly Australian cry, and one\\nwhich is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the\\nperson whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was\\nsomeone who had been in Australia.”\\n“What of the rat, then?”\\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on\\nthe table. “This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,” he said. “I wired to\\nBristol for it last night.” He put his hand over part of the map. “What do\\nyou read?”\\n“ARAT,” I read.\\n“And now?” He raised his hand.\\n“BALLARAT.”\\n“Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only\\ncaught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his\\nmurderer. So and so, of Ballarat.”\\n“It is wonderful!” I exclaimed.\\n“It is obvious. And now, y ou see, I had narrowed the field down\\nconsiderably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which,\\ngranting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come\\nnow out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from\\nBallarat with a grey cloak.”\\n“Certainly.”\\n“And one w ho was at home in the district, for the pool can only be\\napproached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly\\nwander.”\\n“Quite so .”\\n“Then com es our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I\\ngained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the\\npersonality of the criminal.”\\n“But how did you gain them ?”\\n“You know my method. It is fo unded upon the observation of trifles.”\\n“His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his\\nstride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.”\\n“Yes, they were peculiar boots.”\\n“But his lameness?”\\n“The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He\\nput less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped—he was lame.”\\n“But his left-handedness.”\\n“You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the\\nsurgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and\\nyet was upon the left side. Now,\\n131\\nhow can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind\\nthat tree during the interview between the father and son. He had even\\nsmoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of\\ntobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you\\nknow, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the\\nashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having\\nfound the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the\\nmoss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are\\nrolled in Rotterdam.”\\n“And the cigar-holder?”\\n“I could see that the en d had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a\\nholder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean\\none, so I deduced a blunt penknife.”\\n“Holmes,” I said, “you have drawn a net round this man from which he\\ncannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you\\nhad cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all this\\npoints. The culprit is—”\\n“Mr. John Turner,” cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sittingroom,\\nand ushering in a visitor.\\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow,\\nlimping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and\\nyet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed\\nthat he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His\\ntangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined\\nto give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an\\nashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a\\nshade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some\\ndeadly and chronic disease.\\n“Pray sit down on the sofa,” said Holmes gently. “You had my note?”\\n“Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to s ee me\\nhere to avoid scandal.”\\n“I thought people woul d talk if I went to the Hall.” “And why did you wish\\nto see me?” He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary\\neyes, as though his question was already answered.\\n“Yes,” said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. “It is so. I\\nknow all about McCarthy.”\\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. “God help me!” he cried. “But I\\nwould not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I\\nwould have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.”\\n“I am glad to hear you say so,” said Holmes gravely. “I woul d have spoken\\nnow had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart—it will break\\nher heart when she hears that I am arrested.”\\n133\\n“It may not come to that,” said Holmes.\\n“What?”\\n“I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required\\nmy presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must\\nbe got off, however.”\\n“I am a dying man,” said old Turner. “I have had diabetes for years. My\\ndoctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather\\ndie under my own roof than in a gaol.”\\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle\\nof paper before him. “Just tell us the truth,” he said. “I shall jot down the\\nfacts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce\\nyour confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise\\nyou that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.”\\n“It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a question whether I shall live to the\\nAssizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the\\nshock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time\\nin the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\\n“You didn’t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell\\nyou that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has\\nbeen upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I’ll tell you\\nfirst how I came to be in his power.\\n“It was in the early ‘60’s at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hotblooded\\nand reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad\\ncompanions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush,\\nand in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber.\\nThere were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station\\nfrom time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.\\nBlack Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still\\nremembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\\n“One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we\\nlay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it\\nwas a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley.\\nThree of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my\\npistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I\\nwish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his\\nwicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature.\\nWe got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over\\nto England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and\\ndetermined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this\\nestate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little\\ngood with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I\\nmarried, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little\\nAlice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me\\ndown the\\n135\\nright path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf\\nand did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when\\nMcCarthy laid his grip upon me.\\n“I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street\\nwith hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\\n“‘Here we are, Jack,’ says he, touching me on the arm; ‘we’ll be as good as\\na family to you. There’s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the\\nkeeping of us. If you don’t—it’s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and\\nthere’s always a policeman within hail.’\\n“Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off,\\nand there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no\\nrest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his\\ncunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he\\nsoon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police.\\nWhatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without\\nquestion, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could\\nnot give. He asked for Alice.\\n“His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to\\nbe in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step\\ninto the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed\\nstock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood\\nwas in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I\\nbraved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between\\nour houses to talk it over.\\n“When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a\\ncigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to\\nhis talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He\\nwas urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she\\nmight think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to\\nthink that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a\\nman as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a\\ndesperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that\\nmy own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved\\nif I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it\\nagain. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for\\nit. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me\\nwas more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction\\nthan if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his\\nson; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back\\nto fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story,\\ngentlemen, of all that occurred.”\\n“Well, it is not for me to judge you,” said Holmes as the old man signed the\\nstatement which had been drawn out. “I pray\\n137\\nthat we may never be exposed to such a temptation.” “I pray not, sir. And\\nwhat do you intend to do?” “In view of your health, nothing. You are\\nyourself aware\\nthat you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the\\nAssizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall\\nbe forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your\\nsecret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.”\\n“Farewell, then,” said the old man solemnly. “Your own deathbeds, when\\nthey come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have\\ngiven to mine.” Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled\\nslowly from the room.\\n“God help us!” said Holmes after a long silence. “Why does fate play such\\ntricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I\\ndo not think of Baxter’s words, and say, ‘There, but for the grace of God,\\ngoes Sherlock Holmes.’”\\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number\\nof objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the\\ndefending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview,\\nbut he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter\\nmay come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which\\nrests upon their past.\\nAdventure 5.\\nThe Five Orange Pips\\nWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases\\nbetween the years ’82 and ’90, I am faced by so many which present\\nstrange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to\\nchoose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity\\nthrough the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar\\nqualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the\\nobject of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical\\nskill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while\\nothers have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations\\nfounded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical\\nproof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last\\n139\\nwhich was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am\\ntempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in\\nconnection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,\\nentirely cleared up.\\nThe year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less\\ninterest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one\\ntwelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber,\\nof the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower\\nvault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the\\nBritish barque “Sophy Anderson”, of the singular adventures of the Grice\\nPatersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning\\ncase. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by\\nwinding up the dead man’s watch, to prove that it had been wound up two\\nhours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that\\ntime—a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the\\ncase. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them\\npresent such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I\\nhave now taken up my pen to describe.\\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in\\nwith exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had\\nbeaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, handmade\\nLondon we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the\\nroutine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces\\nwhich shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed\\nbeasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and\\nthe wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat\\nmoodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime,\\nwhile I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories until\\nthe howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the\\nsplash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My\\nwife was on a visit to her mother’s, and for a few days I was a dweller once\\nmore in my old quarters at Baker Street.\\n“Why,” said I, glancing up at my companion, “that was surely the bell. Who\\ncould come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?”\\n“Except yourself I have none,” he answered. “I do not encourage visitors.”\\n“A client, then?”\\n“If so, it is a serio us case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day\\nand at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of\\nthe landlady’s.”\\nSherlock Holme s was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a\\nstep in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm\\nto turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon\\nwhich a newcomer must sit.\\n141 “Come in!” said he.\\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside,\\nwell-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy\\nin his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his\\nlong shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had\\ncome. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could\\nsee that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is\\nweighed down with some great anxiety.\\n“I owe you an apology,” he said, raising his golden pincenez to his eyes. “I\\ntrust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the\\nstorm and rain into your snug chamber.”\\n“Give me your coat and umbrella,” said Holmes. “They may rest here on\\nthe hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the south-west,\\nI see.”\\n“Yes, from Horsham.”\\n“That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite\\ndistinctive.”\\n“I have com e for advice.”\\n“That is easily got.”\\n“And help.”\\n“That is not always so easy.”\\n“I have heard of you, Mr. Ho lmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you\\nsaved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.”\\n“Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.”\\n“He said that you could solve anything.”\\n“He said too much.”\\n“That you are never beaten.”\\n“I have been beaten four times—three times by men, and once by a\\nwoman.”\\n“But wha t is that compared with the number of your successes?”\\n“It is true that I have been generally successful.”\\n“Then you may be so with me.”\\n“I beg that you will draw your c hair up to the fire and favour me with some\\ndetails as to your case.”\\n“It is no ordinary one.”\\n“None of those which c ome to me are. I am the last court of appeal.”\\n“And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you hav e ever\\nlistened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those\\nwhich have happened in my own family.”\\n“You fill me with interest,” said Holmes . “Pray give us the essential facts\\nfrom the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those\\ndetails which seem to me to be most important.”\\nThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed h is wet feet out towards the\\nblaze.\\n“My n ame,” said he, “is John Openshaw, but my own af\\n143\\nfairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It\\nis a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go\\nback to the commencement of the affair.\\n“You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle Elias and my\\nfather Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged\\nat the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the\\nOpenshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he\\nwas able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.\\n“My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and\\nbecame a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well.\\nAt the time of the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and afterwards under\\nHood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my\\nuncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years.\\nAbout 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in\\nSussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the\\nStates, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and\\nhis dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He\\nwas a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he\\nwas angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he\\nlived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden\\nand two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his\\nexercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his\\nroom. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he\\nwould see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own\\nbrother.\\n“He didn’t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he\\nsaw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year\\n1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my\\nfather to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When\\nhe was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with\\nme, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and\\nwith the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite\\nmaster of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do\\nwhat I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one\\nsingular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up\\namong the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never\\npermit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy’s curiosity I have\\npeeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a\\ncollection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.\\n“One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon\\nthe table in front of the colonel’s plate. It was not a common thing for him\\nto receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no\\nfriends of any sort. ‘From India!’ said he as he took it up, ‘Pondicherry\\npostmark!\\n145\\nWhat can this be?’ Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried\\norange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this,\\nbut the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had\\nfallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared\\nat the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’ he\\nshrieked, and then, ‘My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!’\\n“‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried.\\n“‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving\\nme palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red\\nink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times\\nrepeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the\\nreason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I\\nascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which\\nmust have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a\\ncashbox, in the other.\\n“‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them still,’ said he with\\nan oath. ‘Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send\\ndown to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’\\n“I did as he ordered, and when the lawye r arrived I was asked to step up to\\nthe room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass\\nof black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open\\nand empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon\\nthe lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the\\nenvelope.\\n“‘I wish y ou, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness my will. I leave my estate,\\nwith all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father,\\nwhence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well\\nand good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to\\nyour deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I\\ncan’t say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where\\nMr. Fordham shows you.’\\n“I signed the paper as dire cted, and the lawyer took it away with him. The\\nsingular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me,\\nand I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being\\nable to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of\\ndread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks\\npassed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I\\ncould see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he\\nwas less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in\\nhis room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would\\nemerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and\\ntear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was\\nafraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen,\\nby man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush\\ntumultuously in at\\n147\\nthe door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out\\nno longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times\\nI have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it\\nwere new raised from a basin.\\n“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your\\npatience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies\\nfrom which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for\\nhim, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of\\nthe garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two\\nfeet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought\\nin a verdict of ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew how he winced from the very\\nthought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of\\nhis way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into\\npossession of the estate, and of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit\\nat the bank.”\\n“One moment,” Holmes interposed, “your statement is, I foresee, one of the\\nmost remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the\\nreception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.”\\n“The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,\\nupon the night of May 2nd.”\\n“Thank you. Pray proceed.”\\n“When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made\\na careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We\\nfound the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the\\ninside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated\\nupon it, and ‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’ written beneath.\\nThese, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been\\ndestroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much\\nimportance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books\\nbearing upon my uncle’s life in America. Some of them were of the war\\ntime and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of\\na brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the\\nSouthern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had\\nevidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had\\nbeen sent down from the North.\\n“Well, it was the beginning of ’8 4 when my father came to live at Horsham,\\nand all went as well as possible with us until the January of ’85. On the\\nfourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise\\nas we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly\\nopened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched\\npalm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cockand-\\nbull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now\\nthat the same thing had come upon himself.\\n“‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John? ’ he stammered.\\n149 “My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’ said I.\\n“He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried. ‘Here are the very\\nletters. But what is this written above them?’\\n“‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peepi ng over his shoulder.\\n“‘What papers? What sundial?’ he asked.\\n“‘The sundial in the garden. There is no other,’ said I; ‘but the papers must\\nbe those that are destroyed.’\\n“‘Pooh!’ said he, gripping h ard at his courage. ‘We are in a civilised land\\nhere, and we can’t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come\\nfrom?’\\n“‘From Dundee,’ I answered, glancing at the postmark.\\n“‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he. ‘What have I to do with\\nsundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.’\\n“‘I should certainly speak to the police,’ I said.\\n“‘And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of t he sort.’\\n“‘Then let me do so?’\\n“‘No, I forbid you. I w on’t have a fuss made about such nonsense.’\\n“It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate ma n. I went\\nabout, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\\n“On the third day after the coming of the letter my father w ent from home\\nto visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of\\nthe forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to\\nme that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that,\\nhowever, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a\\ntelegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had\\nfallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood,\\nand was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he\\npassed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it\\nappears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country\\nwas unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation\\nin bringing in a verdict of ‘death from accidental causes.’ Carefully as I\\nexamined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything\\nwhich could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no\\nfootmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the\\nroads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and\\nthat I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\\n“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did\\nnot dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles\\nwere in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s life, and that\\nthe danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.\\n“It was in January, ’85, that my poor father met his end, an d two years and\\neight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily\\nat Horsham, and I had begun to\\n151\\nhope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended\\nwith the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however;\\nyesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come\\nupon my father.”\\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning\\nto the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\\n“This is the envelope,” he continued. “The postmark is London—eastern\\ndivision. Within are the very words which were upon my father’s last\\nmessage: ‘K. K. K.’; and then ‘Put the papers on the sundial.’”\\n“What have you done?” asked Holmes.\\n“Nothing.”\\n“Nothing?”\\n“To tell the truth”—he sank his face into his thin, white\\nhands—”I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when\\nthe snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless,\\ninexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.”\\n“Tut! tut!” cried Sherlock Holmes. “You must act, man, or you are lost.\\nNothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.”\\n“I have seen the police.”\\n“Ah!”\\n“But th ey listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced\\nthat the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical\\njokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury\\nstated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.”\\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. “Incredible imbecility!” he\\ncried.\\n“They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the\\nhouse with me.”\\n“Has he come w ith you to-night?”\\n“No. His orders were to stay in the house.”\\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\\n“Why did you come to me,” he cried, “and, above all, why did you not\\ncome at once?”\\n“I did not know . It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about\\nmy troubles and was advised by him to come to you.”\\n“It is really two days since you had the letter. We sho uld have acted before\\nthis. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have\\nplaced before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?”\\n“There is one thing,” said John Openshaw. He rummaged in hi s coat pocket,\\nand, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out\\nupon the table. “I have some remembrance,” said he, “that on the day when\\nmy uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins\\nwhich lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single\\nsheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to\\n153\\nthink that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from\\namong the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the\\nmention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a\\npage from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.”\\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which\\nshowed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was\\nheaded, “March, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical\\nnotices:\\n“4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\\n“7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramo re, and John\\nSwain, of St. Augustine.\\n“9th. McCauley cleared.\\n“10th. John Swain cleare d.\\n“12th. Visited Paramore. A ll well.”\\n“Thank you!” said Holmes, foldin g up the paper and returning it to our\\nvisitor. “And now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot\\nspare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home\\ninstantly and act.”\\n“What shall I do?”\\n“There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this\\npiece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have\\ndescribed. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were\\nburned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must\\nassert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done\\nthis, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you\\nunderstand?”\\n“Entirely.”\\n“Do not thi nk of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we\\nmay gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while\\ntheirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing\\ndanger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to\\npunish the guilty parties.”\\n“I thank you,” said the yo ung man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. “You\\nhave given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise.”\\n“Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the\\nmeanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are\\nthreatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?”\\n“By train from Waterloo.”\\n“It is not yet nine. The stre ets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in\\nsafety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.”\\n“I am armed.”\\n“That is well. T o-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.”\\n“I shall see you at Horsham, then?”\\n“No, your secret lies in London. It i s there that I shall seek it.”\\n155\\n“Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box\\nand the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.” He shook hands\\nwith us and took his leave. Outside the wind still screamed and the rain\\nsplashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed\\nto have come to us from amid the mad elements—blown in upon us like a\\nsheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now to have been reabsorbed by them\\nonce more.\\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward\\nand his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and\\nleaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased\\neach other up to the ceiling.\\n“I think, Watson,” he remarked at last, “that of all our cases we have had\\nnone more fantastic than this.”\\n“Save, perhaps, the Sign of Fou r.”\\n“Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. An d yet this John Openshaw seems to me to\\nbe walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.”\\n“But have you,” I asked, “formed any definite conception as to what these\\nperils are?”\\n“There can be no question as to their nature,” he answered.\\n“Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why doe s he pursue this\\nunhappy family?”\\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of\\nhis chair, with his finger-tips together. “The ideal reasoner,” he remarked,\\n“would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings,\\ndeduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all\\nthe results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a\\nwhole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who\\nhas thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to\\naccurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet\\ngrasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be\\nsolved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution\\nby the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is\\nnecessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have\\ncome to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a\\npossession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education\\nand encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so\\nimpossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is\\nlikely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my\\ncase to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of\\nour friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.”\\n“Yes,” I answered, laughing. “It was a singular docume nt. Philosophy,\\nastronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable,\\ngeology profound as regards the mudstains from any region within fifty\\nmiles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational\\nliterature and\\n157\\ncrime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and selfpoisoner\\nby cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of\\nmy analysis.”\\nHolmes grinned at the last item. “Well,” he said, “I say now, as I said then,\\nthat a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture\\nthat he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of\\nhis library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the\\none which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all\\nour resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the ‘American\\nEncyclopaedia’ which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now\\nlet us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the\\nfirst place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw\\nhad some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do\\nnot change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of\\nFlorida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love\\nof solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or\\nsomething, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of\\nsomeone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was\\nhe feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters\\nwhich were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the\\npostmarks of those letters?”\\n“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third\\nfrom London.”\\n“From East L ondon. What do you deduce from that?” “They are all\\nseaports. That the writer was on board of a\\nship.”\\n“Exce llent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt\\nthat the probability—the strong probability—is that the wr iter\\nwas on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point .\\nIn the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the\\nthreat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or\\nfour days. Does that suggest anything?”\\n“A greater distance to travel.”\\n“But the letter had also a grea ter distance to come.” “Then I do not see the\\npoint.”\\n“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which\\nthe man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they a lways\\nsend their singular warning or token before them when start ing upon their\\nmission. You see how quickly the deed followed\\nthe sign when it came from Dundee. If they had c ome from\\nPondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as\\nsoon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elap sed.\\nI think that those seven weeks represented the difference betwee n the mailboat\\nwhich brought the letter and the sailing\\nvessel which brought the writer.”\\n“It is possible.”\\n“More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly\\nurgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to\\ncaution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time\\n159\\nwhich it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes\\nfrom London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.”\\n“Good God!” I cried. “What can it mean, this relentless persecution?”\\n“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importa nce to\\nthe person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that\\nthere must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried\\nout two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s jury. There must\\nhave been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and\\ndetermination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it\\nmay. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual\\nand becomes the badge of a society.”\\n“But of what society?”\\n“Have you never—” s aid Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking\\nhis voice—”have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”\\n“I never have.”\\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. “Here it is,” said\\nhe presently:\\n“‘Ku Klux K lan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the\\nsound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed\\nby some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War,\\nand it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country,\\nnotably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its\\npower was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the\\nnegro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who\\nwere opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning\\nsent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape—a\\nsprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On\\nreceiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or\\nmight fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would\\nunfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen\\nmanner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its\\nmethods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded\\nin braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced\\nhome to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite\\nof the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of\\nthe community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement\\nrather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of\\nthe same sort since that date.’\\n“You will observe,” said Holm es, laying down the volume, “that the sudden\\nbreaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of\\nOpenshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause\\nand effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more\\nimplacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and\\n161\\ndiary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may\\nbe many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.”\\n“Then the page we have seen—”\\n“Is such as we might expect. It ra n, if I remember right, ‘sent the pips to A,\\nB, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them. Then there are\\nsuccessive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that\\nC was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that\\nwe may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only\\nchance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him.\\nThere is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my\\nviolin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the\\nstill more miserable ways of our fellow-men.”\\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued\\nbrightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock\\nHolmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\\n“You will excuse me for not waiting for you,” said h e; “I have, I foresee, a\\nvery busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw’s.”\\n“What steps will you take?” I asked.\\n“It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may have\\nto go down to Horsham, after all.”\\n“You will not go there first?”\\n“No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will\\nbring up your coffee.”\\nAs I waited, I lifted th e unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my\\neye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.\\n“Holmes,” I cried, “you are too late.”\\n“Ah!” said he, laying down his cup, “I feared as much. How was it done?”\\nHe spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\\n“My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading ‘Tragedy Near\\nWaterloo Bridge.’ Here is the account:\\n“Between nine and ten last night Polic e-Constable Cook, of the H Division,\\non duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water.\\nThe night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the\\nhelp of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The\\nalarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body\\nwas eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose\\nname, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was\\nJohn Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured\\nthat he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo\\nStation, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path\\nand walked over the edge of one of the small landingplaces for river\\nsteamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no\\ndoubt that the deceased had been\\n163\\nthe victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of\\ncalling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside\\nlanding-stages.”\\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken\\nthan I had ever seen him.\\n“That hurts my pride, W atson,” he said at last. “It is a petty feeling, no\\ndoubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now,\\nand, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he\\nshould come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death\\n—!” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable\\nagitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and\\nunclasping of his long thin hands.\\n“They must be cunning devils,” h e exclaimed at last. “How could they have\\ndecoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the\\nstation. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for\\ntheir purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am\\ngoing out now!”\\n“To the police?”\\n“No; I shall be m y own police. When I have spun the web they may take the\\nflies, but not before.”\\nAll day I was engag ed in my professional work, and it was late in the\\nevening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come\\nback yet. It was nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale and\\nworn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he\\ndevoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.\\n“You are hungry,” I remarked.\\n“Starving. It had escaped my m emory. I have had nothing since breakfast.”\\n“Nothing?”\\n“Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.”\\n“And how have you succeeded?”\\n“Well.”\\n“You ha ve a clue?”\\n“I have them in th e hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long\\nremain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark\\nupon them. It is well thought of!”\\n“What do you mean?”\\nHe took an orange fro m the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed\\nout the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an\\nenvelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote “S. H. for J. O.” Then he sealed\\nit and addressed it to “Captain James Calhoun, Barque ‘Lone Star,’\\nSavannah, Georgia.”\\n“That will await him when he enters port,” said he, chuckling. “It may give\\nhim a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as\\nOpenshaw did before him.”\\n“And who is this Captain Ca lhoun?”\\n“The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.”\\n165 “How did you trace it, then?”\\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and\\nnames.\\n“I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over Lloyd’s registers and files of\\nthe old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at\\nPondicherry in January and February in ’83. There were thirty-six ships of\\nfair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one,\\nthe ‘Lone Star,’ instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was\\nreported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to\\none of the states of the Union.”\\n“Texas, I think.”\\n“I was not and a m not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an\\nAmerican origin.”\\n“What then?”\\n“I searched th e Dundee records, and when I found that the barque ‘Lone\\nStar’ was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. I then\\ninquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London.”\\n“Yes?”\\n“The ‘L one Star’ had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert\\nDock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this\\nmorning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned\\nthat she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no\\ndoubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of\\nWight.”\\n“What w ill you do, then?”\\n“Oh, I have my hand upo n him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the\\nonly native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans.\\nI know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it\\nfrom the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their\\nsailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and\\nthe cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three\\ngentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.”\\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the\\nmurderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which\\nwould show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves,\\nwas upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales\\nthat year. We waited long for news of the “Lone Star” of Savannah, but\\nnone ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the\\nAtlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of\\na wave, with the letters “L. S.” carved upon it, and that is all which we shall\\never know of the fate of the “Lone Star.”\\nAdventure 6.\\nThe Man with the Twisted Lip.\\nIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the\\nTheological College of St. George’s, was much addicted to opium. The\\nhabit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was\\nat college; for having read De Quincey’s description of his dreams and\\nsensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to\\nproduce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the\\npractice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he\\ncontinued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to\\nhis friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face,\\ndrooping lids, and pinpoint pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin\\nof a noble man.\\n167\\nOne night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell, about the\\nhour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in\\nmy chair, and my wife laid her needlework down in her lap and made a\\nlittle face of disappointment.\\n“A patient!” said she. “You’ll have to go out.”\\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day. We heard the door\\nopen, a few hurried words, and then\\nquick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in\\nsome dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\\n“You will excuse my calling so late,” she began, and then, suddenly losing\\nher self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife’s neck, and\\nsobbed upon her shoulder. “Oh, I’m in such trouble!” she cried; “I do so\\nwant a little help.”\\n“Why,” said my wife, pulling up her veil, “it is Kate Whitney. How you\\nstartled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.”\\n“I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.” That was always the\\nway. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.\\n“It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and\\nwater, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather\\nthat I sent James off to bed?”\\n“Oh, no, no! I want the doctor’s advice and help, too. It’s about Isa. He has\\nnot been home for two days. I am so fright\\n169 ened about him!”\\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s trouble,\\nto me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We\\nsoothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know\\nwhere her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to\\nher?\\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when\\nthe fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City.\\nHitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come\\nback, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been\\nupon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the\\ndregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There\\nhe was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper\\nSwandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid\\nwoman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from\\namong the ruffians who surrounded him?\\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I\\nnot escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she\\ncome at all? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as such I had\\ninfluence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her\\non my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he\\nwere indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I\\nhad left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding\\neastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time,\\nthough the future only could show how strange it was to be.\\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper\\nSwandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line\\nthe north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slopshop\\nand a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a\\nblack gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in\\nsearch. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in\\nthe centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a\\nflickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into\\na long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and\\nterraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.\\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in\\nstrange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back,\\nand chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye\\nturned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little\\nred circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or\\nwaned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some\\nmuttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low,\\nmonotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly\\ntailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying\\nlittle heed to\\n171\\nthe words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of\\nburning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a\\ntall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows\\nupon his knees, staring into the fire.\\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me\\nand a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\\n“Thank you. I have not come to stay,” said I. “There is a friend of mine\\nhere, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.”\\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering\\nthrough the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out\\nat me.\\n“My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with\\nevery nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?”\\n“Nearly eleven.”\\n“Of what day?”\\n“Of Friday, June 19th.”\\n“Good heavens! I thoug ht it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d’you\\nwant to frighten a chap for?” He sank his face onto his arms and began to\\nsob in a high treble key.\\n“I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days\\nfor you. You should be ashamed of yourself!”\\n“So I am. But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few\\nhours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But I’ll go home with\\nyou. I wouldn’t frighten Kate— poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have\\nyou a cab?”\\n“Yes, I have one waiting.”\\n“Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson.\\nI am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.”\\nI walked down the narrow passage between th e double row of sleepers,\\nholding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and\\nlooking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the\\nbrazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, “Walk\\npast me, and then look back at me.” The words fell quite distinctly upon my\\near. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my\\nside, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent\\nwith age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though\\nit had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward\\nand looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking\\nout into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could\\nsee him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes\\nhad regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my\\nsurprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to\\nme to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the\\ncompany once more, subsided into a doddering,\\n173\\nloose-lipped senility.\\n“Holmes!” I whisper ed, “what on earth are you doing in\\nthis den?”\\n“As low as you can,” he answered; “I have excellent ears. If\\nyou would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish\\nfriend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk\\nwith you.”\\n“I have a c ab outside.”\\n“Then pray send him h ome in it. You may safely trust him,\\nfor he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I sho uld\\nrecommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your\\nwife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If yo u\\nwill wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.” It was difficult to\\nrefuse any of Sherlock Holmes’ requests,\\nfor they were always so exceedingly defin ite, and put forward\\nwith such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when\\nWhitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically\\naccomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything\\nbetter than to be associated with my friend in one of those\\nsingular adventures which were the normal condition of hi s\\nexistence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid\\nWhitney’s bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven\\nthrough the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure\\nhad emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down\\nthe street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled\\nalong with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round,\\nhe straightened himself out and burst into a\\nhearty fit of laughter.\\n“I suppose, Watson,” said he, “that you imagine that I have\\nadded opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the oth er\\nlittle weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your\\nmedical views.”\\n“I was certainly surprised to find you there.”\\n“But not more so than I to find you.”\\n“I came to find a friend.”\\n“And I to find an enemy.”\\n“An enemy?”\\n“Yes; one of m y natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural\\nprey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkabl e\\ninquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent\\nramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been\\nrecognised in that den my life would not have been worth an\\nhour’s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and\\nthe rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have\\nvengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the ba ck of that\\nbuilding, near the corner of Paul’s Wharf, which could tell s ome\\nstrange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless\\nnights.”\\n“What! You do not mean bodies?”\\n“Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000\\npounds for every poor devil who has been done to death in\\nthat den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside,\\n175\\nand I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our\\ntrap should be here.” He put his two forefingers between his teeth and\\nwhistled shrilly—a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from\\nthe distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of\\nhorses’ hoofs.\\n“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the\\ngloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side\\nlanterns. “You’ll come with me, won’t you?”\\n“If I can be of use.”\\n“Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My\\nroom at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.”\\n“The Cedars?”\\n“Yes; that is M r. St. Clair’s house. I am staying there while I conduct the\\ninquiry.”\\n“Where i s it, then?”\\n“Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.”\\n“But I am all in the dark.”\\n“Of course you are. You’ ll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All\\nright, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Look out for me tomorrow,\\nabout eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!”\\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the\\nendless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened\\ngradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the\\nmurky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull\\nwilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,\\nregular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated\\nparty of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a\\nstar or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds.\\nHolmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a\\nman who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this\\nnew quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet\\nafraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several\\nmiles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas,\\nwhen he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the\\nair of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\\n“You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,” said he. “It makes y ou quite\\ninvaluable as a companion. ‘Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have\\nsomeone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was\\nwondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she\\nmeets me at the door.”\\n“You forget that I know nothing about it.”\\n“I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee.\\nIt seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon.\\nThere’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end of it into my hand.\\nNow, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe\\nyou can see a spark where all is dark to me.”\\n“Proceed, then.”\\n177\\n“Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to Lee a\\ngentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of\\nmoney. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived\\ngenerally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood,\\nand in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has\\ntwo children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several\\ncompanies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the\\n5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years\\nof age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate\\nfather, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his\\nwhole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain,\\namount to 88 pounds 10s., while he has 220 pounds standing to his credit in\\nthe Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that\\nmoney troubles have been weighing upon his mind.\\n“Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual,\\nremarking before he started that he had two important commissions to\\nperform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now,\\nby the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday,\\nvery shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of\\nconsiderable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the\\noffices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your\\nLondon, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street,\\nwhich branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night.\\nMrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping,\\nproceeded to the company’s office, got her packet, and found herself at\\nexactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the\\nstation. Have you followed me so far?”\\n“It is very clear.”\\n“If you remembe r, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair\\nwalked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not\\nlike the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking\\nin this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry,\\nand was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it\\nseemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window\\nwas open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being\\nterribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished\\nfrom the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked\\nback by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which\\nstruck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat,\\nsuch as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\\n“Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps\\n—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me\\nto-night—and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the\\nstairs which led to\\n179\\nthe first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar\\nscoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a\\nDane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with\\nthe most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare\\ngood-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an\\ninspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men\\naccompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the\\nproprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last\\nbeen seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor\\nthere was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who,\\nit seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no\\none else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined\\nwas their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to\\nbelieve that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at\\na small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there\\nfell a cascade of children’s bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to\\nbring home.\\n“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made\\nthe inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully\\nexamined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room\\nwas plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which\\nlooked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the\\nbedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at\\nhigh tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window\\nwas a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood\\nwere to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were\\nvisible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain\\nin the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the\\nexception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were\\nthere. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and\\nthere were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he\\nmust apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the\\nominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save\\nhimself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of\\nthe tragedy.\\n“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in\\nthe matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but\\nas, by Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the\\nstair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance at the window,\\nhe could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence\\nwas one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge\\nas to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in\\nany way for the presence of the missing gentleman’s clothes.\\n“So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister\\n181\\ncripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was\\ncertainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His\\nname is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every\\nman who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in\\norder to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax\\nvestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the lefthand\\nside, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it\\nis that this creature takes his daily seat, crosslegged with his tiny stock of\\nmatches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity\\ndescends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside\\nhim. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of\\nmaking his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the\\nharvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so\\nremarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of\\norange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its\\ncontraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin,\\nand a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast\\nto the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of\\nmendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any\\npiece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the\\nman whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to\\nhave been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.”\\n“But a cripple!” said I. “What could he have done singlehanded against a\\nman in the prime of life?”\\n“He is a cripple in the sen se that he walks with a limp; but in other respects\\nhe appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical\\nexperience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often\\ncompensated for by exceptional strength in the others.”\\n“Pray continue your narrative.”\\n“Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at t he sight of the blood upon the window, and\\nshe was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of\\nno help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of\\nthe case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without\\nfinding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had\\nbeen made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few\\nminutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the\\nLascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched,\\nwithout anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it\\nis true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his\\nring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the\\nbleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long\\nbefore, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless\\nfrom the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville\\n183\\nSt. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much\\na mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair’s assertion that she\\nhad actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must\\nhave been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to\\nthe policestation, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the\\nhope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\\n“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had\\nfeared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St. Clair,\\nwhich lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found\\nin the pockets?”\\n“I cannot imagine.”\\n“No, I don’t think y ou would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and\\nhalf-pennies—421 pennies and 270 halfpennies. It was no wonder that it\\nhad not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different\\nmatter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed\\nlikely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body\\nhad been sucked away into the river.”\\n“But I understand that all the other cl othes were found in the room. Would\\nthe body be dressed in a coat alone?”\\n“No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this\\nman Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no\\nhuman eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It\\nwould of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale\\ngarments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out,\\nwhen it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little\\ntime, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force\\nher way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate\\nthat the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost.\\nHe rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his\\nbeggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the\\npockets to make sure of the coat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would\\nhave done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of\\nsteps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police\\nappeared.”\\n“It certainl y sounds feasible.”\\n“Well, we will take it as a wo rking hypothesis for want of a better. Boone,\\nas I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be\\nshown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for\\nyears been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have\\nbeen a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and\\nthe questions which have to be solved—what Neville St. Clair was doing in\\nthe opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and\\nwhat Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance—are all as far from a\\nsolution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my\\nexperience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which\\npresented such difficulties.”\\n185\\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we\\nhad been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last\\nstraggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country\\nhedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through\\ntwo scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.\\n“We are on the outskirts of Lee,” said my companion. “We have touched on\\nthree English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing\\nover an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees?\\nThat is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears\\nhave already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse’s feet.”\\n“But why are you not conducting the case from Baker\\nStreet?” I asked.\\n“Because there a re many inquiries which must be made out\\nhere. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my d isposal, and you\\nmay rest assured that she will have nothing but\\na welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate t o meet her,\\nWatson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are .\\nWhoa, there, whoa!”\\nWe had pulled up in f ront of a large villa which stood within\\nits own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head ,\\nand springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding\\ngravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the\\ndoor flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in\\nsome sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at\\nher neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of\\nlight, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body\\nslightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a\\nstanding question.\\n“Well?” she cried, “well?” And then, seeing that there were two of us, she\\ngave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion\\nshook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\\n“No good news?”\\n“None.”\\n“No bad ?”\\n“No.”\\n“Than k God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a\\nlong day.”\\n“This is m y friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in\\nseveral of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to\\nbring him out and associate him with this investigation.”\\n“I am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my hand warmly. “You will,\\nI am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when\\nyou consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.”\\n“My dear madam,” said I, “I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can\\nvery well see that no apology is needed. If I can\\n187 be of any assistance, either t o you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed\\nhappy.”\\n“Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said the lady as we entered a well-lit diningroom,\\nupon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, “I should\\nvery much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that\\nyou will give a plain answer.”\\n“Certainly, madam.”\\n“Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to\\nfainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.”\\n“Upon what point?”\\n“In your heart of hea rts, do you think that Neville is alive?”\\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the que stion. “Frankly,\\nnow!” she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him\\nas he leaned back in a basketchair.\\n“Frankly, then, madam, I do not.”\\n“You think that he is dead?”\\n“I do.”\\n“Murde red?”\\n“I don’t say th at. Perhaps.”\\n“And on what day did he m eet his death?”\\n“On Monday.”\\n“Then perhaps , Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is\\nthat I have received a letter from him to-day.”\\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.\\n“What!” he roared.\\n“Yes, to-day.” She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.\\n“May I see it?”\\n“Certainly.”\\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the\\ntable he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair\\nand was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one\\nand was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that\\nvery day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.\\n“Coarse writing,” murmured Holmes. “Surely this is not your husband’s\\nwriting, madam.”\\n“No, but the enclo sure is.”\\n“I perceive also that whoev er addressed the envelope had to go and inquire\\nas to the address.”\\n“How can you tell that?”\\n“The name, you see, is i n perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The\\nrest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used.\\nIf it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep\\nblack shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a\\npause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not\\nfamiliar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as\\ntrifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha!\\n189\\nthere has been an enclosure here!”\\n“Yes, there was a ring. His signet-r ing.”\\n“And you are sure that this is your husba nd’s hand?” “One of his hands.”\\n“One?”\\n“His ha nd when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his\\nusual writing, and yet I know it well.”\\n“‘Dearest do not be frightened. All wil l come well. There is\\na huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wa it\\nin patience.—NEVILLE.’ Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf\\nof a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in\\nGravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has\\nbeen gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who\\nhad been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is\\nyour husband’s hand, madam?”\\n“None. Neville wrote those wor ds.”\\n“And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St.\\nClair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say\\nthat the danger is over.”\\n“But he must be alive, M r. Holmes.”\\n“Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.\\nThe ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken\\nfrom him.”\\n“No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!”\\n“Very well. It may, however, have been w ritten on Monday\\nand only posted to-day.”\\n“That is possible.”\\n“If so, much may h ave happened between.”\\n“Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holm es. I know\\nthat all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy b etween\\nus that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day\\nthat I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in\\nthe dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that\\nsomething had happened. Do you think that I would\\nrespond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his d eath?” “I have seen too\\nmuch not to know that the impression of a\\nwoman may be more valuable than the con clusion of an analytical reasoner.\\nAnd in this letter you certainly have a very\\nstrong piece of evidence to corroborate you r view. But if your\\nhusband is alive and able to write letters, why should he rema in away from\\nyou?”\\n“I can not imagine. It is unthinkable.”\\n“And on Monday he made no remark s before leaving you?” “No.”\\n“And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?” “Very mu ch so.”\\n“Was the window open?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Then he might have called to you?”\\n“He might.”\\n“He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?” “Yes.”\\n191\\n“A call for help, you thought?”\\n“Yes. He waved his hands.”\\n“But it might have been a cr y of surprise. Astonishment at\\nthe unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?”\\n“It is possible.”\\n“And you thoug ht he was pulled back?”\\n“He disappeared so suddenly.”\\n“He might have leaped back. Y ou did not see anyone else in the room?”\\n“No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the La scar\\nwas at the foot of the stairs.”\\n“Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes\\non?”\\n“But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.”\\n“Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?”\\n“Never.”\\n“Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?”\\n“Never.”\\n“Thank y ou, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I\\nwished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then\\nretire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.”\\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room ha d been placed at our\\ndisposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my\\nnight of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he\\nhad an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a\\nweek, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from\\nevery point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself\\nthat his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now\\npreparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on\\na large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting\\npillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these\\nhe constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself\\ncross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out\\nin front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old\\nbriar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the\\nceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the\\nlight shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off\\nto sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up,\\nand I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still\\nbetween his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a\\ndense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had\\nseen upon the previous night.\\n“Awake, Watson?” he asked.\\n“Yes.”\\n“Game for a morning drive?”\\n“Certainly.”\\n193\\n“Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps,\\nand we shall soon have the trap out.” He chuckled to himself as he spoke,\\nhis eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of\\nthe previous night.\\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was\\nstirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when\\nHolmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.\\n“I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his boots. “I\\nthink, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most\\nabsolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross.\\nBut I think I have the key of the affair now.”\\n“And where is it?” I asked, smiling.\\n“In the bathroom,” he answered. “O h, yes, I am not joking,” he continued,\\nseeing my look of incredulity. “I have just been there, and I have taken it\\nout, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall\\nsee whether it will not fit the lock.”\\nWe made our way downstairs as qu ietly as possible, and out into the bright\\nmorning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad\\nstable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed\\ndown the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in\\nvegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as\\nsilent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\\n“It has been in some points a singular case ,” said Holmes, flicking the horse\\non into a gallop. “I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is\\nbetter to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.”\\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their\\nwindows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down\\nthe Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up\\nWellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow\\nStreet. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two\\nconstables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse’s head while\\nthe other led us in.\\n“Who is on duty?” asked Holmes.\\n“Inspector Bradstreet, sir.”\\n“Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?” A tall, stout official had come down the\\nstone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. “I wish to have a\\nquiet word with you, Bradstreet.” “Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my\\nroom here.” It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the\\ntable, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at\\nhis desk.\\n“What ca n I do for you, Mr. Holmes?”\\n“I called about that beggarman, Boo ne—the one who was charged with\\nbeing concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.”\\n195\\n“Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.”\\n“So I heard. You have him here?”\\n“In the cells.”\\n“Is he quiet?”\\n“Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.”\\n“Dirty?”\\n“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as\\nblack as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a\\nregular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me\\nthat he needed it.”\\n“I should like to se e him very much.”\\n“Would you? That is easily done. Com e this way. You can leave your bag.”\\n“No, I think that I’ll take it.”\\n“Very good. Come this way , if you please.” He led us down a passage,\\nopened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a\\nwhitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\\n“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “He re it is!” He quietly\\nshot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.\\n“He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very well.”\\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards\\nus, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middlesized\\nman, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt\\nprotruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had\\nsaid, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not\\nconceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right\\nacross it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of\\nthe upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock\\nof very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\\n“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.\\n“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked H olmes. “I had an idea that he\\nmight, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” He opened the\\nGladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large\\nbath-sponge.\\n“He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.\\n“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we\\nwill soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”\\n“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “He do esn’t look a credit\\nto the Bow Street cells, does he?” He slipped his key into the lock, and we\\nall very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled\\ndown once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug,\\nmoistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down\\nthe prisoner’s face.\\n“Let me introduce y ou,” he shouted, “to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the\\ncounty of Kent.”\\n197\\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off under\\nthe sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone,\\ntoo, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip\\nwhich had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the\\ntangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced,\\nrefined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes\\nand staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising\\nthe exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face\\nto the pillow.\\n“Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the missing man. I know\\nhim from the photograph.”\\nThe prisoner turned with th e reckless air of a man who abandons himself to\\nhis destiny. “Be it so,” said he. “And pray what am I charged with?”\\n“With making away with Mr. Neville St.— Oh, come, you can’t be charged\\nwith that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,” said the\\ninspector with a grin. “Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force,\\nbut this really takes the cake.”\\n“If I am Mr. Neville St. Clai r, then it is obvious that no crime has been\\ncommitted, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.”\\n“No crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said Holmes. “You\\nwould have done better to have trusted you wife.”\\n“It was not the wife; it was the children,” groane d the prisoner. “God help\\nme, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an\\nexposure! What can I do?”\\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly\\non the shoulder.\\n“If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said he, “of course\\nyou can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the\\npolice authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know\\nthat there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers.\\nInspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you\\nmight tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then\\nnever go into court at all.”\\n“God bless you!” cried th e prisoner passionately. “I would have endured\\nimprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret\\nas a family blot to my children.\\n“You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a\\nschoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I\\ntravelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an\\nevening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of\\narticles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them.\\nThere was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by\\ntrying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base\\nmy articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of\\nmaking up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took\\nadvantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as\\npitiable as\\n199\\npossible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the\\naid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair,\\nand an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city,\\nostensibly as a matchseller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied\\nmy trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise\\nthat I had received no less than 26s. 4d.\\n“I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time\\nlater, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for 25\\npounds. I was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea\\ncame to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked for a\\nholiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under\\nmy disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\\n“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at 2\\npounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing\\nmy face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It\\nwas a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at\\nlast, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had\\nfirst chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with\\ncoppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in\\nwhich I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning\\nemerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a\\nwell-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me\\nfor his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\\n“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I\\ndo not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn 700 pounds\\na year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional\\nadvantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee,\\nwhich improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in\\nthe City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me,\\nand it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pounds.\\n“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and\\neventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real\\noccupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little\\nknew what.\\n“Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room\\nabove the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my\\nhorror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her\\neyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover\\nmy face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent\\nanyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that\\nshe could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a\\nbeggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not\\npierce so complete a\\n201\\ndisguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the\\nroom, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window,\\nreopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in\\nthe bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by\\nthe coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I\\ncarried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the\\nThames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there\\nwas a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather,\\nI confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St.\\nClair, I was arrested as his murderer.\\n“I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was\\ndetermined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my\\npreference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly\\nanxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment\\nwhen no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling\\nher that she had no cause to fear.”\\n“That note only reached her yesterday,” said Holmes. “Good God! What a\\nweek she must have spent!” “The police have watched this Lascar,” said\\nInspector\\nBradstreet, “and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post\\na letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his,\\nwho forgot all about it for some days.”\\n“That was it,” said Holmes, nodding ap provingly; “I have\\nno doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?”\\n“Many times; but what was a fine to me?”\\n“It must stop here, however,” said Bradstr eet. “If the police are to hush this\\nthing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.”\\n“I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.”\\n“In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken.\\nBut if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes,\\nthat we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I\\nwish I knew how you reach your results.”\\n“I reached this one,” said my friend, “ by sitting upon five pillows and\\nconsuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker\\nStreet we shall just be in time for breakfast.”\\n7.\\nThe Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle.\\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning\\nafter Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the\\nseason. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a piperack\\nwithin his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers,\\nevidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden\\nchair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hardfelt\\nhat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and\\na forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been\\nsuspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.\\n“You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt you.” “Not at all. I am glad\\nto have a friend with whom I can\\n203\\ndiscuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one”—he jerked his\\nthumb in the direction of the old hat—”but there are points in connection\\nwith it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.”\\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling\\nfire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice\\ncrystals. “I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as it looks, this thing has\\nsome deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clue which will guide you in\\nthe solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.”\\n“No, no. No crime,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “Only one of those\\nwhimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million\\nhuman beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles.\\nAmid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every\\npossible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a\\nlittle problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without\\nbeing criminal. We have already had experience of such.”\\n“So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six cases which I have added to\\nmy notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.”\\n“Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to\\nthe singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man\\nwith the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall\\ninto the same\\n205\\ninnocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?” “Yes.”\\n“It is to him that this trophy belongs.”\\n“It is his hat.”\\n“No, no, he fo und it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you\\nwill look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem.\\nAnd, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in\\ncompany with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this\\nmoment in front of Peterson’s fire. The facts are these: about four o’clock\\non Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow,\\nwas returning from some small jollification and was making his way\\nhomeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the\\ngaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white\\ngoose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a\\nrow broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the\\nlatter knocked off the man’s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend\\nhimself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind\\nhim. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants;\\nbut the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an officiallooking\\nperson in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to\\nhis heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the\\nback of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance\\nof Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also\\nof the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most\\nunimpeachable Christmas goose.”\\n“Which surely he restored to their owner?”\\n“My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that ‘For Mrs. Henry\\nBaker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird’s left leg,\\nand it is also true that the initials ‘H. B.’ are legible upon the lining of this\\nhat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of\\nHenry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to\\nany one of them.”\\n“What, then, did P eterson do?”\\n“He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,\\nknowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose\\nwe retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the\\nslight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary\\ndelay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of\\na goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who\\nlost his Christmas dinner.”\\n“Did he not advertise?”\\n“No.”\\n“Then , what clue could you have as to his identity?”\\n“Only as much as we can deduce.”\\n“From his hat?”\\n“Precisely.”\\n207\\n“But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?”\\n“Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yours elf as\\nto the individuality of the man who has worn this article?”\\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It\\nwas a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the\\nworse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal\\ndiscoloured. There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the\\ninitials “H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for\\na hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked,\\nexceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to\\nhave been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them\\nwith ink.\\n“I can see nothing,” said I, handing it back to my friend.\\n“On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. Yo u fail, however, to\\nreason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.”\\n“Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”\\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fa shion which\\nwas characteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have\\nbeen,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences which are very\\ndistinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of\\nprobability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon\\nthe face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three\\nyears, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has\\nless now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when\\ntaken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil\\ninfluence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the\\nobvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.”\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\n“He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,” he continued,\\ndisregarding my remonstrance. “He is a man who leads a sedentary life,\\ngoes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair\\nwhich he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with\\nlime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from\\nhis hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid\\non in his house.”\\n“You are certainl y joking, Holmes.”\\n“Not in the least. Is it possible that e ven now, when I give you these results,\\nyou are unable to see how they are attained?”\\n“I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable\\nto follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was\\nintellectual?”\\nFor answer H olmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the\\nforehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question of cubic\\ncapacity,” said he; “a man with so\\n209\\nlarge a brain must have something in it.”\\n“The decline of his fortunes, then?”\\n“This hat is three years old. These fl at brims curled at the\\nedge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of\\nribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so\\nexpensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has\\nassuredly gone down in the world.”\\n“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the\\nmoral retrogression?”\\nSherlock Holmes laug hed. “Here is the foresight,” said he putting his finger\\nupon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They are never sold upon\\nhats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight,\\nsince he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But\\nsince we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it,\\nit is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct\\nproof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to\\nconceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which\\nis a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”\\n“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”\\n“The further points, that he is middle-a ged, that his hair is grizzled, that it\\nhas been recently cut, and that he uses limecream, are all to be gathered\\nfrom a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses\\na large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all\\nappear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This\\ndust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy\\nbrown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of\\nthe time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that\\nthe wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best\\nof training.”\\n“But his wif e—you said that she had ceased to love him.” “This hat has not\\nbeen brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week’s\\naccumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go\\nout in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough\\nto lose your wife’s affection.”\\n“But he might be a bachelor.”\\n“Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.\\nRemember the card upon the bird’s leg.” “You have an answer to\\neverything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his\\nhouse?” “One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I\\nsee no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual\\nmust be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks upstairs\\nat night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the\\nother. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you\\nsatisfied?”\\n“Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since, as\\n211\\nyou said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done\\nsave the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.”\\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open,\\nand Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed\\ncheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\\n“The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!” he gasped. “Eh? What of it,\\nthen? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?”\\nHolmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the\\nman’s excited face.\\n“See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!” He held out his hand\\nand displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue\\nstone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that\\nit twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.\\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. “By Jove, Peterson!” s aid he, “this\\nis treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?”\\n“A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as thoug h it were\\nputty.”\\n“It’s m ore than a precious stone. It is the precious stone.”\\n“Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!” I ejaculat ed.\\n“Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the\\nadvertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely\\nunique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of\\n1000 pounds is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.”\\n“A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!” The commissionaire plumped\\ndown into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\\n“That is the reward, and I have reason to know that th ere are sentimental\\nconsiderations in the background which would induce the Countess to part\\nwith half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.”\\n“It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopo litan,” I remarked.\\n“Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a\\nplumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s jewel-case.\\nThe evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to\\nthe Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.” He\\nrummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he\\nsmoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:\\n“Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumbe r, was\\nbrought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from\\nthe jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the\\nblue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence\\nto the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of\\n213\\nthe Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might\\nsolder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with\\nHorner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he\\nfound that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open,\\nand that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the\\nCountess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the\\ndressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the\\nsame evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in\\nhis rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having\\nheard Ryder’s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having\\nrushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last\\nwitness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of\\nHorner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the\\nstrongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been\\ngiven against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with\\nthe offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of\\nintense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and\\nwas carried out of court.”\\n“Hum! So much for the police-court,” said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing\\naside the paper. “The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events\\nleading from a rifled jewelcase at one end to the crop of a goose in\\nTottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions\\nhave suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect.\\nHere is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from\\nMr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other\\ncharacteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves\\nvery seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has\\nplayed in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means\\nfirst, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening\\npapers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.”\\n“What will you say?”\\n“Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: ‘Found at the corner of\\nGoodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the\\nsame by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.’ That is clear\\nand concise.”\\n“Very. But wi ll he see it?”\\n“Well, he is sure to keep a n eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss\\nwas a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the\\nwindow and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but\\nflight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which\\ncaused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will\\ncause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to\\nit. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this\\nput in the evening papers.”\\n“In which, sir?”\\n215 “Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall M all, St. James’s, Evening\\nNews, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.” “Very well, sir.\\nAnd this stone?”\\n“Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say,\\nPeterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for\\nwe must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your\\nfamily is now devouring.”\\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it\\nagainst the light. “It’s a bonny thing,” said he. “Just see how it glints and\\nsparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is.\\nThey are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may\\nstand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found\\nin the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in\\nhaving every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade\\ninstead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history.\\nThere have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several\\nrobberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of\\ncrystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a\\npurveyor to the gallows and the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now\\nand drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.”\\n“Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?” “I cannot tell.”\\n“Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry\\nBaker, had anything to do with the matter?”\\n“It is, I think, much more likely that Henry B aker is an\\nabsolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which\\nhe was carrying was of considerably more value than if it wer e\\nmade of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very\\nsimple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.” “An d you can do\\nnothing until then?”\\n“Nothing.”\\n“In that cas e I shall continue my professional round. But I\\nshall come back in the evening at the hour you have menti oned, for I should\\nlike to see the solution of so tangled a\\nbusiness.”\\n“Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock,\\nI believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I\\nought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.”\\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a litt le after halfpast six when I\\nfound myself in Baker Street once more. As I\\napproached the house I saw a tall man in a Sc otch bonnet with\\na coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in\\nthe bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. J ust\\nas I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown u p together to\\nHolmes’ room.\\n“Mr. Henry Bak er, I believe,” said he, rising from his armchair and greeting\\nhis visitor with the easy air of geniality which\\nhe could so readily assume. “Pray take this chair by the fire,\\nMr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circula\\n217\\ntion is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just\\ncome at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?”\\n“Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.”\\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad,\\nintelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch\\nof red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand,\\nrecalled Holmes’ surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was\\nbuttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists\\nprotruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a\\nslow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the\\nimpression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage\\nat the hands of fortune.\\n“We have retained these things for some days,” said Holmes, “because we\\nexpected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a\\nloss to know now why you did not advertise.”\\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been so\\nplentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt that the\\ngang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I\\ndid not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering\\nthem.”\\n“Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.”\\n“To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\\n“Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not don e so. But I\\npresume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same\\nweight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?”\\n“Oh, certainly, certainly,” answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\\n“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of y our own\\nbird, so if you wish—”\\nThe man burst into a he arty laugh. “They might be useful to me as relics of\\nmy adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see what use the\\ndisjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I\\nthink that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the\\nexcellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.”\\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me wit h a slight shrug of his\\nshoulders.\\n“There is y our hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By the way, would\\nit bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of\\na fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.”\\n“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained\\nproperty under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn,\\nnear the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day,\\nyou understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a\\ngoose\\n219\\nclub, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were\\neach to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is\\nfamiliar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted\\nneither to my years nor my gravity.” With a comical pomposity of manner\\nhe bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\\n“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes when he had closed the door\\nbehind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the\\nmatter. Are you hungry, Watson?”\\n“Not particularly.”\\n“Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this\\nclue while it is still hot.”\\n“By all means.”\\nIt was a bitter n ight, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about\\nour throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and\\nthe breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots.\\nOur footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors’\\nquarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into\\nOxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha\\nInn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which\\nruns down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar\\nand ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, whiteaproned\\nlandlord.\\n“Your be er should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,” said he.\\n“My geese!” The man seemed surprised.\\n“Yes. I was speaking only half an hour a go to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a\\nmember of your goose club.”\\n“Ah! yes, I see. But you see, s ir, them’s not our geese.”\\n“Indeed! Whose, then?”\\n“Well, I got the two doze n from a salesman in Covent Garden.”\\n“Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?”\\n“Breckinridge is his name.”\\n“Ah! I don’t know him. Well, here’s your good health landlord, and\\nprosperity to your house. Good-night.”\\n“Now for Mr. Breckinridge,” he cont inued, buttoning up his coat as we\\ncame out into the frosty air. “Remember, Watson that though we have so\\nhomely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a\\nman who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless we can\\nestablish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his\\nguilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been\\nmissed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands.\\nLet us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick\\nmarch!”\\nWe pass ed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of\\nslums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of\\nBreckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp\\nface and\\n221\\ntrim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters. “Good-evening.\\nIt’s a cold night,” said Holmes. The salesman nodded and shot a\\nquestioning glance at my\\ncompanion.\\n“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at\\nthe bare slabs of marble.\\n“Let you have five hundr ed to-morrow morning.” “That’s no good.”\\n“Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.” “Ah, bu t I was\\nrecommended to you.”\\n“Who by?”\\n“The landlo rd of the Alpha.”\\n“Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.”\\n“Fine birds they were, too. Now where d id you get them\\nfrom?”\\nTo my s urprise the question provoked a burst of anger from\\nthe salesman.\\n“Now, then, m ister,” said he, with his head cocked and his\\narms akimbo, “what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight,\\nnow.”\\n“It is s traight enough. I should like to know who sold you\\nthe geese which you supplied to the Alpha.”\\n“Well then, I shan’t tell you. So now!”\\n“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; bu t I don’t know why\\nyou should be so warm over such a trifle.”\\n“Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I\\npay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business;\\nbut it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the geese to?’ and\\n‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they were the only\\ngeese in the\\nworld, to he ar the fuss that is made over them.”\\n“Well, I have no connection with any other peop le who\\nhave been making inquiries,” said Holmes carelessly. “I f you\\nwon’t tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I’m always ready to\\nback my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it\\nthat the bird I ate is country bred.”\\n“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,”\\nsnapped the salesman.\\n“It’s nothing of the kin d.”\\n“I say it is.”\\n“I don’t beli eve it.”\\n“D’you think you k now more about fowls than I, who have\\nhandled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those\\nbirds that went to the Alpha were town bred.”\\n“You’ll never persuade me to believe that.”\\n“Will you bet, then?”\\n“It’s merely taking yo ur money, for I know that I am right.\\nBut I’ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to\\nbe obstinate.”\\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. “Bring me the books, Bill,”\\nsaid he.\\nThe sma ll boy brought round a small thin volume and a\\n223 great greasy-backed one, lay ing them out together beneath the hanging\\nlamp.\\n“Now then, Mr. Cocksure,” said the salesman, “I thought that I was out of\\ngeese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still one left in my shop.\\nYou see this little book?”\\n“Well?”\\n“That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see? Well, then, here on\\nthis page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where\\ntheir accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in\\nred ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third\\nname. Just read it out to me.”\\n“Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,” read Holmes.\\n“Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.”\\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. “He re you are, ‘Mrs. Oakshott, 117,\\nBrixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’”\\n“Now, then, what’s the last entry?”\\n“‘December 22nd. Twenty-four gee se at 7s. 6d.’”\\n“Quite so. There you are. And underneath?”\\n“‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s .’”\\n“What have you to say now?”\\nSherlock Holmes looked deep ly chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his\\npocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man\\nwhose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a\\nlamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar\\nto him.\\n“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink ‘un’\\nprotruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,” said he. “I\\ndaresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of him, that man would\\nnot have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by\\nthe idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy,\\nnearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be\\ndetermined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or\\nwhether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly\\nfellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about\\nthe matter, and I should—”\\nHis remarks were suddenl y cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out\\nfrom the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced\\nfellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown\\nby the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door\\nof his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\\n“I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “I wish you were all\\nat the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk\\nI’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I’ll answer her, but\\nwhat have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?”\\n“No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the l ittle man.\\n225\\n“Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”\\n“She told me to ask you.”\\n“Well, you can ask the Kin g of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve\\nhad enough of it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the\\ninquirer flitted away into the darkness.\\n“Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes. “Come\\nwith me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.” Striding\\nthrough the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls,\\nmy companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the\\nshoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every\\nvestige of colour had been driven from his face.\\n“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked in a quavering voice.\\n“You will excuse me,” said Holmes blandly, “but I could not h elp\\noverhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think\\nthat I could be of assistance to you.”\\n“You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?”\\n“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people\\ndon’t know.”\\n“But you can know nothing of this?”\\n“Excuse me, I know everything of i t. You are endeavouring to trace some\\ngeese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman\\nnamed Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by\\nhim to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.”\\n“Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to me et,” cried the little\\nfellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. “I can hardly explain\\nto you how interested I am in this matter.”\\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler wh ich was passing. “In that case we\\nhad better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept marketplace,”\\nsaid he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have\\nthe pleasure of assisting.”\\nThe man hesitated for an instant. “My name is John Robinson,” he\\nanswered with a sidelong glance.\\n“No, no; the real name,” said Ho lmes sweetly. “It is always awkward doing\\nbusiness with an alias.”\\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. “Well then,” said he,\\n“my real name is James Ryder.”\\n“Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the\\ncab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to\\nknow.”\\nThe lit tle man stood glancing from one to the other of us with halffrightened,\\nhalf-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the\\nverge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in\\nhalf an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had\\nbeen said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new\\ncompanion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands,\\n227\\nspoke of the nervous tension within him.\\n“Here we are!” said Holmes cheerily as w e filed into the\\nroom. “The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. Yo u look\\ncold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on\\nmy slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now,\\nthen! You want to know what became of those geese?” “Yes , sir.”\\n“Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine\\nin which you were interested—white, with a black bar acros s\\nthe tail.”\\nRyder qu ivered with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you\\ntell me where it went to?”\\n“It came here.”\\n“Here?”\\n“Yes, an d a most remarkable bird it proved. I don’t wonder\\nthat you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it w as\\ndead—the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen .\\nI have it here in my museum.”\\nOur visitor staggered to his fee t and clutched the mantelpiece with his right\\nhand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box\\nand held up the blue carbuncle, which s hone out like a star,\\nwith a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stoo d glaring with a\\ndrawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown\\nit.\\n“T he game’s up, Ryder,” said Holmes quietly. “Hold up,\\nman, or you’ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back int o his chair, Watson.\\nHe’s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a\\ndash of brandy. So! Now he looks a\\nlittle more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!” For a moment he had\\nstaggered and nearly fallen, but the\\nbrandy brought a tinge of colour int o his cheeks, and he sat\\nstaring with frightened eyes at his accuser.\\n“I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs\\nwhich I could possibly need, so there is little which you n eed\\ntell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the\\ncase complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the\\nCountess of Morcar’s?”\\n“It was Catherine Cusac k who told me of it,” said he in a\\ncrackling voice.\\n“I see—her lady ship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation\\nof sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you , as it\\nhas been for better men before you; but you were not very scrup ulous in the\\nmeans you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there\\nis the making of a very pretty villain in you. You k new that this\\nman Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such\\nmatter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily\\nupon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job\\nin my lady’s room—you and your confederate Cusack—and\\nyou managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when\\nhe had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and ha d\\nthis unfortunate man arrested. You then—”\\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon t he rug and\\n229\\nclutched at my companion’s knees. “For God’s sake, have mercy!” he\\nshrieked. “Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I\\nnever went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I’ll swear it on a\\nBible. Oh, don’t bring it into court! For Christ’s sake, don’t!”\\n“Get back into your chair!” said Holmes sternly. “It is very well to cringe\\nand crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the\\ndock for a crime of which he knew nothing.”\\n“I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against\\nhim will break down.”\\n“Hum! We will talk ab out that. And now let us hear a true account of the\\nnext act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into\\nthe open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.”\\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “I will tell you it just as it\\nhappened, sir,” said he. “When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me\\nthat it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not\\nknow at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search\\nme and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be\\nsafe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister’s\\nhouse. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road,\\nwhere she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met\\nseemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold\\nnight, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton\\nRoad. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I\\ntold her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went\\ninto the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best\\nto do.\\n“I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just\\nbeen serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into\\ntalk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they\\nstole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things\\nabout him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived,\\nand take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone\\ninto money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had\\ngone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized\\nand searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was\\nleaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were\\nwaddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head\\nwhich showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.\\n“My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her\\ngeese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as\\nher word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to\\nKilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of\\nthe birds— a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying\\n231\\nits bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could\\nreach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and\\ndown into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my\\nsister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute\\nbroke loose and fluttered off among the others.\\n“‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ says she.\\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me one for Christmas, and I was\\nfeeling which was the fattest.’\\n“‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yo urs aside for you—Jem’s bird, we call it. It’s\\nthe big white one over yonder. There’s twentysix of them, which makes one\\nfor you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.’\\n“‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the sam e to you, I’d rather\\nhave that one I was handling just now.’\\n“‘The other is a good three pound he avier,’ said she, ‘and we fattened it\\nexpressly for you.’\\n“‘Never mind. I’ll h ave the other, and I’ll take it now,’ said I.\\n“‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed. ‘Which i s it you want,\\nthen?’\\n“‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.’\\n“‘Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.’\\n“Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to\\nKilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to\\ntell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and\\nopened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the\\nstone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird,\\nrushed back to my sister’s, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a\\nbird to be seen there.\\n“‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.\\n“‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.’\\n“‘Which dealer’s?’\\n“‘Breckinridge, of C ovent Garden.’\\n“‘But was there another with a barr ed tail?’ I asked, ‘the same as the one I\\nchose?’\\n“‘Yes, J em; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them\\napart.’\\n“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would\\ncarry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not\\none word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him\\nyourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister\\nthinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now\\n— and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the\\nwealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!” He burst\\ninto convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.\\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy brea thing and by the\\nmeasured tapping of Sherlock Holmes’ finger\\n233\\ntips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the\\ndoor.\\n“Get out!” said he.\\n“What, sir! Oh, He aven bless you!”\\n“No more words. Get out!”\\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the\\nstairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the\\nstreet.\\n“After all, Watson,” said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, “I\\nam not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in\\ndanger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against\\nhim, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony,\\nbut it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong\\nagain; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you make\\nhim a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has\\nput in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its\\nown reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will\\nbegin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature.”\\n8.\\nThe Adventure of the Speckled Band.\\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during\\nthe last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I\\nfind many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none\\ncommonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for\\nthe acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any\\ninvestigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the\\nfantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which\\npresented more singular features than that which was associated with the\\nwell-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in\\nquestion occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when\\nwe were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I\\nmight\\n235\\nhave placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at\\nthe time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the\\nuntimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as\\nwell that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that\\nthere are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott\\nwhich tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.\\nIt was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find\\nSherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a\\nlate riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it\\nwas only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and\\nperhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\\n“Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he, “but it’s the common lot this\\nmorning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on\\nyou.”\\n“What is it, then—a fire?”\\n“No; a client. It seems tha t a young lady has arrived in a considerable state\\nof excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the\\nsitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this\\nhour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I\\npresume that it is something very pressing which they have to\\ncommunicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am\\nsure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should\\ncall you and give you the chance.”\\n“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”\\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Hol mes in his professional\\ninvestigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions,\\nand yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the\\nproblems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and\\nwas ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the\\nsittingroom. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been\\nsitting in the window, rose as we entered.\\n“Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes cheerily. “My name is Sherlock\\nHolmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom\\nyou can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs.\\nHudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I\\nshall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.”\\n“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman in a low vo ice,\\nchanging her seat as requested.\\n“What, then?”\\n“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her veil as she spoke, and we\\ncould see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all\\ndrawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted\\nanimal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair\\nwas shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary\\n237 and haggard. Sherlock Holm es ran her over with one of his quick, allcomprehensive\\nglances.\\n“You must not fear,” said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her\\nforearm. “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come\\nin by train this morning, I see.”\\n“You know me, then?”\\n“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left\\nglove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dogcart,\\nalong heavy roads, before you reached the station.”\\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\\n“There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “The left arm o f\\nyour jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks\\nare perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up\\nmud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the\\ndriver.”\\n“Whate ver your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,” said she. “I\\nstarted from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came\\nin by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall\\ngo mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none, save only one, who\\ncares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you,\\nMr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in\\nthe hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir,\\ndo you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light\\nthrough the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my\\npower to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall\\nbe married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall\\nnot find me ungrateful.”\\nHolmes turned to his de sk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book,\\nwhich he consulted.\\n“Farintosh,” said he . “Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an\\nopal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam,\\nthat I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of\\nyour friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at\\nliberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits\\nyou best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may\\nhelp us in forming an opinion upon the matter.”\\n“Alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation lies in the fact\\nthat my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon\\nsmall points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of\\nall others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell\\nhim about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I\\ncan read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard,\\nMr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the\\nhuman heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which\\nencompass me.”\\n239\\n“I am all attention, madam.”\\n“My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the\\nlast survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of\\nStoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”\\nHolmes nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me,” said he.\\n“The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates\\nextended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the\\nwest. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute\\nand wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a\\ngambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of\\nground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a\\nheavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the\\nhorrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather,\\nseeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an\\nadvance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and\\nwent out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of\\ncharacter, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused\\nby some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his\\nnative butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he\\nsuffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a\\nmorose and disappointed man.\\n“When Dr. Roylott was in In dia he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the\\nyoung widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister\\nJulia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my\\nmother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less than\\n1000 pounds a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while\\nwe resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be\\nallowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return\\nto England my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a railway\\naccident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish\\nhimself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old\\nancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was\\nenough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our\\nhappiness.\\n“But a terr ible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of\\nmaking friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first\\nbeen overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat,\\nhe shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in\\nferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper\\napproaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in\\nmy stepfather’s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence\\nin the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended\\nin the policecourt, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the\\n241 folks would fly at his approa ch, for he is a man of immense strength, and\\nabsolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\\n“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and\\nit was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that\\nI was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save\\nthe wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp\\nupon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family\\nestate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering\\naway with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for\\nIndian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has\\nat this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his\\ngrounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.\\n“You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no\\ngreat pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long\\ntime we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her\\ndeath, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.”\\n“Your sister is dead, then?”\\n“She died just two years ag o, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to\\nyou. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we\\nwere little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had,\\nhowever, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who\\nlives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at\\nthis lady’s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there\\na half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather\\nlearned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection\\nto the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for\\nthe wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only\\ncompanion.”\\nSherlock Ho lmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed\\nand his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced\\nacross at his visitor.\\n“Pray be precise as t o details,” said he.\\n“It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared\\ninto my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and\\nonly one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the\\nground floor, the sittingrooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of\\nthese bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott’s, the second my sister’s, and the\\nthird my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open\\nout into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?”\\n“Perfectly so.”\\n“The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night\\nDr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not\\nretired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian\\ncigars which it was\\n243\\nhis custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine,\\nwhere she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At\\neleven o’clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked\\nback.\\n“‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead\\nof the night?’\\n“‘Never,’ said I.\\n“‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?’\\n“‘Certainly not. But why?’\\n“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the\\nmorning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has\\nawakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next\\nroom, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether\\nyou had heard it.’\\n“‘No, I have not. I t must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.’\\n“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did n ot hear\\nit also.’\\n“‘Ah, bu t I sleep more heavily than you.’\\n“‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at me,\\nclosed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.”\\n“Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at\\nnight?”\\n“Alway s.”\\n“And why? ”\\n“I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon.\\nWe had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”\\n“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”\\n“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeli ng of impending misfortune\\nimpressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you\\nknow how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely\\nallied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was\\nbeating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub\\nof the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew\\nthat it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round\\nme, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a\\nlow whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a\\nclanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage,\\nmy sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared\\nat it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the\\nlight of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face\\nblanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying\\nto and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her,\\nbut at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.\\nShe writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully\\nconvulsed. At first I thought that she\\n245\\nhad not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a\\nvoice which I shall never forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The\\nspeckled band!’ There was something else which she would fain have said,\\nand she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor’s\\nroom, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out,\\ncalling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in\\nhis dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious,\\nand though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from\\nthe village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without\\nhaving recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my\\nbeloved sister.”\\n“One moment,” said Holmes, “are you sure about this whistle and metallic\\nsound? Could you swear to it?”\\n“That was what the county coro ner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong\\nimpression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the\\ncreaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”\\n“Was your sister dressed?”\\n“No, she was in her night -dress. In her right hand was found the charred\\nstump of a match, and in her left a match-box.”\\n“Showing that she had struck a light and looke d about her when the alarm\\ntook place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come\\nto?”\\n“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct had\\nlong been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory\\ncause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon\\nthe inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters\\nwith broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were\\ncarefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the\\nflooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney\\nis wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that\\nmy sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no\\nmarks of any violence upon her.”\\n“How about poison?”\\n“The doctors examine d her for it, but without success.”\\n“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, th en?”\\n“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it\\nwas that frightened her I cannot imagine.”\\n“Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?”\\n“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”\\n“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band— a speckled\\nband?”\\n“Somet imes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,\\nsometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to\\nthese very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted\\nhandkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have\\nsuggested the strange\\n247 adjective which she used.”\\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\\n“These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with your narra tive.”\\n“Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lone lier\\nthan ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for\\nmany years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name\\nis Armitage— Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane\\nWater, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match,\\nand we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some\\nrepairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall\\nhas been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my\\nsister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then,\\nmy thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible\\nfate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had\\nbeen the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing\\nwas to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however,\\nso I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at\\nthe Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I\\nhave come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking\\nyour advice.”\\n“You have do ne wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me all?”\\n“Yes, all.”\\n“Miss Roy lott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.”\\n“Why, what do you mean?”\\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the\\nhand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of\\nfour fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\\n“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.\\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is a hard\\nman,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”\\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chi n upon his\\nhands and stared into the crackling fire.\\n“This is a very deep business,” he said at last. “There are a thousand details\\nwhich I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action.\\nYet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran today,\\nwould it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the\\nknowledge of your stepfather?”\\n“As it happens, he spoke of c oming into town to-day upon some most\\nimportant business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there\\nwould be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old\\nand foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.”\\n249\\n“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?” “By no means.”\\n“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”\\n“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town.\\nBut I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there in time for\\nyour coming.”\\n“And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small\\nbusiness matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?”\\n“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my\\ntrouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.” She\\ndropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.\\n“And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock\\nHolmes, leaning back in his chair.\\n“It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.” “Dark enough and\\nsinister enough.”\\n“Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and\\nwalls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable,\\nthen her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her\\nmysterious end.”\\n“What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very\\npeculiar words of the dying woman?”\\n“I cannot think.”\\n“When you comb ine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of\\ngipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have\\nevery reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his\\nstepdaughter’s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact\\nthat Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been\\ncaused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into\\nits place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be\\ncleared along those lines.”\\n“But what, then, did the gi psies do?”\\n“I cannot imagine.”\\n“I see many objectio ns to any such theory.”\\n“And so do I. It is precisely for that reas on that we are going to Stoke\\nMoran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may\\nbe explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”\\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our\\ndoor had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed\\nhimself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the\\nprofessional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frockcoat,\\nand a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.\\nSo tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway,\\nand his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face,\\nseared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked\\nwith every evil passion, was\\n251\\nturned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bileshot eyes, and his\\nhigh, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce\\nold bird of prey.\\n“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.\\n“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion\\nquietly.\\n“I am D r. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”\\n“Indeed, Doctor,” said Holmes blandly. “Pray t ake a seat.”\\n“I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been h ere. I have traced\\nher. What has she been saying to you?”\\n“It is a little cold for the time of the yea r,” said Holmes.\\n“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old m an furiously.\\n“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continu ed my\\ncompanion imperturbably.\\n“Ha! You put me off, do y ou?” said our new visitor, taking a step forward\\nand shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of\\nyou before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”\\nMy friend smiled.\\n“Holmes, the busy body!”\\nHis smile broadened.\\n“Holmes, the Scotlan d Yard Jack-in-office!”\\nHolmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversat ion is most entertaining,” said\\nhe. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.”\\n“I will go when I have said my say. Don’t you dare to meddle w ith my\\naffairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a\\ndangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward, seized\\nthe poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\\n“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, an d hurling the\\ntwisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\\n“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughin g. “I am not quite\\nso bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was\\nnot much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up the steel\\npoker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\\n“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with th e official detective\\nforce! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only\\ntrust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing\\nthis brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and\\nafterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’ Commons, where I hope to get\\nsome data which may help us in this matter.”\\nIt was nearly one o’clock when Sherloc k Holmes returned from his\\nexcursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with\\nnotes and figures.\\n“I have seen the w ill of the deceased wife,” said he. “To determine its exact\\nmeaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the\\ninvestments with which it is con\\n253\\ncerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife’s death was little\\nshort of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not\\nmore than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an income of 250 pounds,\\nin case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married,\\nthis beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would\\ncripple him to a very serious extent. My morning’s work has not been\\nwasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for\\nstanding in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too\\nserious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are\\ninteresting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab\\nand drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your\\nrevolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument with\\ngentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are,\\nI think, all that we need.”\\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where\\nwe hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through\\nthe lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few\\nfleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just\\nthrowing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant\\nsmell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between\\nthe sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were\\nengaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat\\npulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the\\ndeepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder,\\nand pointed over the meadows.\\n“Look there!” said he.\\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a\\ngrove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey\\ngables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\\n“Stoke Moran?” said he.\\n“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the driver.\\n“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where w e\\nare going.”\\n“There’s th e village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some\\ndistance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll find it\\nshorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields. There it\\nis, where the lady is walking.”\\n“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading his eyes.\\n“Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”\\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap r attled back on its way to\\nLeatherhead.\\n“I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile, “that this fellow\\nshould think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business.\\nIt may stop his gossip. Good\\n255 afternoon, Miss Stoner. You s ee that we have been as good as our word.”\\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which\\nspoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she cried, shaking\\nhands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone\\nto town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.”\\n“We have had the pleasure of making the doctor’s acquaintance,” said\\nHolmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss\\nStoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\\n“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.” “So it appears.”\\n“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from\\nhim. What will he say when he returns?”\\n“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is some\\none more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lo ck\\nyourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take\\nyou away to your aunt’s at Harrow. Now, we must make the\\nbest use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms\\nwhich we are to examine.”\\nThe building was of grey, l ichen-blotched stone, with a high\\ncentral portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a cra b,\\nthrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows\\nwere broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof\\nwas partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better\\nrepair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds\\nin the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed\\nthat this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected\\nagainst the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there\\nwere no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked\\nslowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention\\nthe outsides of the win\\ndows.\\n“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to\\nsleep, the centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to t he\\nmain building to Dr. Roylott’s chamber?”\\n“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.” “Pending the\\nalterations, as I understand. By the way, there\\ndoes not seem to be any very pressing need fo r repairs at that\\nend wall.”\\n“There we re none. I believe that it was an excuse to move\\nme from my room.”\\n“Ah! that is suggesti ve. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the\\ncorridor from which these three rooms open.\\nThere are windows in it, of course?”\\n“Yes, but very small ones. Too narro w for anyone to pass\\nthrough.”\\n“As you b oth locked your doors at night, your rooms were\\nunapproachable from that side. Now, would you have th e kindness to go\\ninto your room and bar your shutters?”\\n257\\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the\\nopen window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but\\nwithout success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to\\nraise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid\\niron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!” said he, scratching his\\nchin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No\\none could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the\\ninside throws any light upon the matter.”\\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three\\nbedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we\\npassed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping,\\nand in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room,\\nwith a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old countryhouses.\\nA brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow whitecounterpaned\\nbed in another, and a dressingtable on the left-hand side of the\\nwindow. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the\\nfurniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The\\nboards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten\\noak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original\\nbuilding of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat\\nsilent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in\\nevery detail of the apartment.\\n“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing to a\\nthick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying\\nupon the pillow.\\n“It goes to the housekeeper’s room.”\\n“It looks newer than the other things? ”\\n“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.” “Your sister asked for it,\\nI suppose?”\\n“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get\\nwhat we wanted for ourselves.”\\n“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull\\nthere. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satis fy\\nmyself as to this floor.” He threw himself down upon his fa ce\\nwith his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and\\nforward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards .\\nThen he did the same with the wood-work with which the\\nchamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed a nd\\nspent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and\\ndown the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and\\ngave it a brisk tug.\\n“Why, it’s a dumm y,” said he.\\n“Won’t it ring?”\\n“No, it is not ev en attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see\\nnow that it is fastened to a hook just above\\nwhere the little opening for the ventilator is.”\\n“How very absurd! I never noticed that before .”\\n259\\n“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or two\\nvery singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder\\nmust be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same\\ntrouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”\\n“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.\\n“Done about the same time as the bell-rop e?” remarked\\nHolmes.\\n“Yes, the re were several little changes carried out about that\\ntime.”\\n“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—\\ndummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. W ith\\nyour permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researche s\\ninto the inner apartment.”\\nDr. Grimesby Roylott’s ch amber was larger than that of his\\nstep-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a\\nsmall wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technic al character, an\\narmchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against\\nthe wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the p rincipal\\nthings which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and\\nexamined each and all of them with the keenest interest. “W hat’s in here?”\\nhe asked, tapping the safe.\\n“My stepfather’s business papers.”\\n“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”\\n“Only once, some years ago. I rem ember that it was full of\\npapers.”\\n“There i sn’t a cat in it, for example?”\\n“No. What a strange idea!”\\n“Well, look at this!” He too k up a small saucer of milk which\\nstood on the top of it.\\n“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”\\n“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet\\na saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I\\ndaresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine. ”\\nHe squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined\\nthe seat of it with the greatest attention.\\n“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his lens in his\\npocket. “Hullo! Here is something interesting!”\\nThe object which had caught his eye was a smal l dog lash\\nhung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was cur led\\nupon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord. “Wha t do you make\\nof that, Watson?”\\n“It’s a common en ough lash. But I don’t know why it should\\nbe tied.”\\n“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked\\nworld, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it i s the\\nworst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner,\\nand with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn. ” I had never\\nseen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so\\ndark as it was when we turned from the scen e of this investiga\\n261\\ntion. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss\\nStoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused\\nhimself from his reverie.\\n“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should absolutely\\nfollow my advice in every respect.”\\n“I shall most certainly do so.”\\n“The matter is too serious fo r any hesitation. Your life may depend upon\\nyour compliance.”\\n“I assure you that I am in your hands.”\\n“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room.”\\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\\n“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over\\nthere?”\\n“Yes, th at is the Crown.”\\n“Very good. Your window s would be visible from there?”\\n“Certainly.”\\n“You must c onfine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when\\nyour stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night,\\nyou must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp\\nthere as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which\\nyou are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no\\ndoubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.”\\n“Oh, yes, easily.”\\n“The rest you wil l leave in our hands.”\\n“But what will you do?”\\n“We shall spend the nigh t in your room, and we shall investigate the cause\\nof this noise which has disturbed you.”\\n“I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,” said\\nMiss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.\\n“Perhaps I have.”\\n“Then, for pity’s s ake, tell me what was the cause of my sister’s death.”\\n“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”\\n“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is co rrect, and if she died\\nfrom some sudden fright.”\\n“No, I do not think so. I th ink that there was probably some more tangible\\ncause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned\\nand saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if\\nyou will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon\\ndrive away the dangers that threaten you.”\\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sittingroom\\nat the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window\\nwe could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of\\nStoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive\\npast, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove\\nhim. The boy had some slight difficulty in un\\n263\\ndoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor’s\\nvoice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The\\ntrap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up\\namong the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\\n“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering\\ndarkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a\\ndistinct element of danger.”\\n“Can I be of assistance?”\\n“Your presence might be invaluable.”\\n“Then I shall certainly come.”\\n“It is very kind of you.”\\n“You speak of danger. Y ou have evidently seen more in these\\nrooms than was visible to me.”\\n“No, but I fancy that I may hav e deduced a little more. I\\nimagine that you saw all that I did.”\\n“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what\\npurpose that could answer I confess is more than I can i magine.”\\n“You saw the ventilator, too?”\\n“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing\\nto have a small opening between two rooms. It was so sma ll\\nthat a rat could hardly pass through.”\\n“I knew that we should find a ventila tor before ever we\\ncame to Stoke Moran.”\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\n“Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said\\nthat her sister could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of co urse\\nthat suggested at once that there must be a communication\\nbetween the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it\\nwould have been remarked upon at the coroner’s inq uiry. I deduced a\\nventilator.”\\n“But what h arm can there be in that?”\\n“Well, there is at least a curious coinci dence of dates. A\\nventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the\\nbed dies. Does not that strike you?”\\n“I cannot as yet see any connection. ”\\n“Did you observe anything very pecu liar about that bed?” “No.”\\n“It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastene d like that\\nbefore?”\\n“I cannot say that I have.”\\n“The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the\\nsame relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—or s o\\nwe may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull .” “Holmes,” I\\ncried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time\\nto prevent some subtle and\\nhorrible crime.”\\n“Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does\\ngo wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has\\nknowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of\\ntheir profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think,\\n265\\nWatson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have\\nhorrors enough before the night is over; for goodness’ sake let us have a\\nquiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.”\\nAbout nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was\\ndark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away,\\nand then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone\\nout right in front of us.\\n“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes from the\\nmiddle window.”\\nAs we passed ou t he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining\\nthat we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was\\npossible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out\\non the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light\\ntwinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre\\nerrand.\\nThere w as little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches\\ngaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached\\nthe lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out\\nfrom a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and\\ndistorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and\\nthen ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\\n“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”\\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice\\nupon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his\\nlips to my ear.\\n“It is a nice ho usehold,” he murmured. “That is the baboon.”\\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected . There was a\\ncheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I\\nconfess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes’\\nexample and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My\\ncompanion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table,\\nand cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the\\ndaytime.Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he\\nwhispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to\\ndistinguish the words:\\n“The least sound woul d be fatal to our plans.”\\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\\n“We must sit without light. He wo uld see it through the ventilator.”\\nI nodded again.\\n“Do not go asl eep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol\\nready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in\\nthat chair.”\\nI took out m y revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he plac ed upon the bed\\nbeside him. By it he laid the box of matches and\\n267 the stump of a candle. Then h e turned down the lamp, and we were left in\\ndarkness.\\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not\\neven the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat openeyed,\\nwithin a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which\\nI was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in\\nabsolute darkness.\\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very\\nwindow a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was\\nindeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock,\\nwhich boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those\\nquarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting\\nsilently for whatever might befall.\\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of\\nthe ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong\\nsmell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a\\ndark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent\\nonce more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with\\nstraining ears.Then suddenly another sound became audible— a very\\ngentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually\\nfrom a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed,\\nstruck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.\\n“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”\\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holm es struck\\nthe light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my\\nweary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend\\nlashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and\\nfilled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at\\nthe ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the\\nmost horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and\\nlouder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one\\ndreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the\\ndistant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold\\nto our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last\\nechoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\\n“What can it mean?” I gasped.\\n“It means that it is all over,” H olmes answered. “And perhaps, after all, it is\\nfor the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott’s room.”\\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor . Twice\\nhe struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he\\nturned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my\\nhand.\\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern\\nwith the shutter half open, throwing a\\n269\\nbrilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside\\nthis table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey\\ndressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into\\nred heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the\\nlong lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked\\nupward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the\\nceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish\\nspeckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered\\nhe made neither sound nor motion.\\n“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.\\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and\\nthere reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and\\npuffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\\n“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He has\\ndied within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon\\nthe violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let\\nus thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss\\nStoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has\\nhappened.”\\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and\\nthrowing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid perch\\nand, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed\\nupon it.\\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke\\nMoran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has\\nalready run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to\\nthe terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of\\nher good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came\\nto the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with\\na dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me\\nby Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.\\n“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows,\\nmy dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient\\ndata. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word ‘band,’ which was\\nused by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had\\ncaught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put\\nme upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly\\nreconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that\\nwhatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either\\nfrom the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have\\nalready remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung\\ndown to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was\\nclamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was\\nthere as a bridge for some\\n271\\nthing passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake\\ninstantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the\\ndoctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was\\nprobably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could\\nnot possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as\\nwould occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training.\\nThe rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from\\nhis point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner,\\nindeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would\\nshow where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the\\nwhistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light\\nrevealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk\\nwhich we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through\\nthis ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it\\nwould crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite\\nthe occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner\\nor later she must fall a victim.\\n“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An\\ninspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing\\non it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the\\nventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of\\nwhipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have\\nremained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused\\nby her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible\\noccupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took\\nin order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no\\ndoubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.”\\n“With the result of driving it through the ventilator.” “And also with the\\nresult of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the\\nblows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew\\nupon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible\\nfor Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh\\nvery heavily upon my conscience.”\\n9.\\nThe Adventure of the Engineer’s Thumb.\\nOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock\\nHolmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two\\nwhich I was the means of introducing to his notice—that of Mr. Hatherley’s\\nthumb, and that of Colonel Warburton’s madness. Of these the latter may\\nhave afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other\\nwas so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be\\nthe more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend\\nfewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he\\nachieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told more\\nthan once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much\\nless striking when set forth en bloc in a single half\\n273\\ncolumn of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes,\\nand the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a\\nstep which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances\\nmade a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly\\nserved to weaken the effect.\\nIt was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the events\\noccurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil\\npractice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms,\\nalthough I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to\\nforgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had\\nsteadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from\\nPaddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of\\nthese, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never\\nweary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every\\nsufferer over whom he might have any influence.\\nOne morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the maid\\ntapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington\\nand were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by\\nexperience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs.\\nAs I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the\\ndoor tightly behind him.\\n“I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over\\n275\\nhis shoulder; “he’s all right.”\\n“What is it, then?” I asked, fo r his manner suggested that it\\nwas some strange creature which he had caged up in my r oom. “It’s a new\\npatient,” he whispered. “I thought I’d bring him\\nround myself; then he couldn’t slip away. There he is, all safe\\nand sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the\\nsame as you.” And off he went, this trusty tout, without even\\ngiving me time to thank him.\\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated\\nby the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather twee d\\nwith a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books.\\nRound one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which\\nwas mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more\\nthan five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine\\nface; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impressi on\\nof a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which\\nit took all his strength of mind to control.\\n“I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doc tor,” said he, “but\\nI have had a very serious accident during the night. I came i n\\nby train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to\\nwhere I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly es corted me here. I\\ngave the maid a card, but I see that she has\\nleft it upon the side-table.”\\nI took it up and glanced a t it. “Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer,\\n16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).” That was\\nthe name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. “I regret that I have kept\\nyou waiting,” said I, sitting down in my librarychair. “You are fresh from a\\nnight journey, I understand, which\\nis in itself a monotonous occupatio n.”\\n“Oh, my night could not be called mon otonous,” said he,\\nand laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringin g\\nnote, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my\\nmedical instincts rose up against that laugh.\\n“Stop it!” I cried; “pull yourself together!” a nd I poured out\\nsome water from a caraffe.\\nIt was useless, however. H e was off in one of those hysterical outbursts\\nwhich come upon a strong nature when some\\ngreat crisis is over and gone. Presently he cam e to himself once\\nmore, very weary and pale-looking.\\n“I have been making a fool of myse lf,” he gasped. “Not at all. Drink this.” I\\ndashed some brandy into the water,\\nand the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks. “That’s better!”\\nsaid he. “And now, Doctor, perhaps you\\nwould kindly attend to my thumb, or rat her to the place where\\nmy thumb used to be.”\\nHe unwound the handk erchief and held out his hand. It\\ngave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. T here\\nwere four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface\\nwhere the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or\\ntorn right out from the roots.\\n“Good heavens!” I cried, “th is is a terrible injury. It must\\nhave bled considerably.”\\n277\\n“Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been\\nsenseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding,\\nso I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced\\nit up with a twig.”\\n“Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.”\\n“It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province.”\\n“This has been done,” said I, examining the wound, “by a very heavy and\\nsharp instrument.”\\n“A thing like a clea ver,” said he.\\n“An accident, I presume?”\\n“By no means.”\\n“What! a murde rous attack?”\\n“Very murderous indeed.”\\n“You horrify me.”\\nI sponged the wou nd, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with\\ncotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing,\\nthough he bit his lip from time to time.\\n“How is that?” I asked when I had finis hed.\\n“Capital! Between your brandy and your ba ndage, I feel a new man. I was\\nvery weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.”\\n“Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to\\nyour nerves.”\\n“Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between\\nourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine,\\nI should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very\\nextraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to\\nback it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are\\nso vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.”\\n“Ha!” cried I, “if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire\\nto see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.”\\n“Oh, I have heard of that fellow,” answered my visit or, “and I should be\\nvery glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the\\nofficial police as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?”\\n“I’ll do better. I’ll take you round to him myself.”\\n“I should be immensely obliged to you.”\\n“We’ll call a cab and go together. We s hall just be in time to have a little\\nbreakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?”\\n“Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.”\\n“Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be wit h you in an instant.” I\\nrushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes\\nwas inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.\\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his\\ndressing-gown, reading the agony column\\n279\\nof The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed\\nof all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all\\ncarefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received\\nus in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined\\nus in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance\\nupon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy\\nand water within his reach.\\n“It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.\\nHatherley,” said he. “Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at\\nhome. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your\\nstrength with a little stimulant.”\\n“Thank you,” said my patient. “but I have felt another man since the doctor\\nbandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall\\ntake up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once\\nupon my peculiar experiences.”\\nHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression\\nwhich veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we\\nlistened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.\\n“You must know,” said he, “that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing\\nalone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I\\nhave had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I\\nwas apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of\\nGreenwich.Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come\\ninto a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I determined to\\nstart in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria\\nStreet.\\n“I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a\\ndreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I\\nhave had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all\\nthat my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to 27 pounds\\n10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I\\nwaited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to\\nbelieve that I should never have any practice at all.\\n“Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk\\nentered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon\\nbusiness. He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘Colonel Lysander\\nStark’ engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man\\nrather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that\\nI have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose\\nand chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his\\noutstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and\\ndue to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing\\nassured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge,\\n281\\nwould be nearer forty than thirty.\\n“‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he, with so mething of a German ac\\ncent. ‘You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as\\nbeing a man who is not only proficient in his profession but i s\\nalso discreet and capable of preserving a secret.’\\n“I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at\\nsuch an address. ‘May I ask who it was who gave me so g ood a\\ncharacter?’\\n“‘Well, perh aps it is better that I should not tell you that\\njust at this moment. I have it from the same source that y ou\\nare both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in\\nLondon.’\\n“‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but you will excuse me\\nif I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon m y professional\\nqualifications. I understand that it was on a professional\\nmatter that you wished to speak to me?’\\n“‘Undoubtedly so. But you will find tha t all I say is really to\\nthe point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is\\nquite essential—absolute secrecy, you understand,\\nand of course we may expect that more from a man who is\\nalone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.’ “‘If I promise to\\nkeep a secret,’ said I, ‘you may absolutely\\ndepend upon my doing so.’\\n“He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me\\nthat I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye. “‘Do you\\npromise, then?’ said he at last.\\n“‘Yes, I promise.’\\n“‘Absolute and co mplete silence before, during, and after?\\nNo reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing? ’ “‘I have already\\ngiven you my word.’\\n“‘Very good.’ He sud denly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the\\nroom he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\\n“‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back. ‘I know that clerks\\nare sometimes curious as to their master’s affairs. Now we c an\\ntalk in safety.’ He drew up his chair very close to mine and\\nbegan to stare at me again with the same questioning and\\nthoughtful look.\\n“A feeling of rep ulsion, and of something akin to fear had\\nbegun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshle ss\\nman. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me\\nfrom showing my impatience.\\n“‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said I; ‘my time\\nis of value.’ Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the\\nwords came to my lips.\\n“‘How would fifty guin eas for a night’s work suit you?’ he\\nasked.\\n“‘Mos t admirably.’\\n“‘I say a night’s wo rk, but an hour’s would be nearer the\\nmark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stam ping\\nmachine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is\\nwrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you th ink\\n283\\nof such a commission as that?’\\n“‘The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’ “‘Precisely so. We\\nshall want you to come to-night by the\\nlast train.’\\n“‘Where to ?’\\n“‘To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire,\\nand within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which\\nwould bring you there at about 11:15.’\\n“‘Very good.’\\n“‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’ “‘There is a drive, then?’\\n“‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good\\nseven miles from Eyford Station.’\\n“‘Then we can hardly get there be fore midnight. I suppose\\nthere would be no chance of a train back. I should be com pelled to stop the\\nnight.’\\n“‘Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.’ “‘That is very awkward.\\nCould I not come at some more\\nconvenient hour?’\\n“‘We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to\\nrecompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to\\nyou, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an\\nopinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of cou rse,\\nif you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of\\ntime to do so.’\\n“I thought of th e fifty guineas, and of how very useful they\\nwould be to me. ‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to\\naccommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to\\nunderstand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to\\ndo.’\\n“‘Qu ite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which\\nwe have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity .\\nI have no wish to commit you to anything without your hav ing it all laid\\nbefore you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe\\nfrom eavesdroppers?’\\n“‘Entirely.’\\n“‘Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that\\nfuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in\\none or two places in England?’\\n“‘I have heard so.’\\n“‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very small\\nplace—within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough\\nto discover that there was a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one o f\\nmy fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit\\nwas a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link betw een two very\\nmuch larger ones upon the right and left—\\nboth of them, however, in the grounds of m y neighbours.These\\ngood people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained\\nthat which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it\\nwas to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its\\ntrue value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could\\n285\\ndo this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they\\nsuggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit\\nand that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to\\nbuy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time,\\nand in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This\\npress, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your\\nadvice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if\\nit once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little\\nhouse, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would\\nbe good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our\\nplans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a\\nhuman being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all\\nplain?’\\n“‘I quite follow you,’ said I. ‘The only point which I could not quite\\nunderstand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating\\nfuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.’\\n“‘Ah!’ said he carelessly, ‘we have our own process. We compress the earth\\ninto bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that\\nis a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr.\\nHatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.’ He rose as he spoke. ‘I\\nshall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.’\\n“‘I shall certainly be there.’\\n“‘And not a word to a soul .’ He looked at me with a last long, questioning\\ngaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the\\nroom.\\n“Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much\\nastonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had\\nbeen intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was\\nat least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own\\nservices, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the\\nother hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant\\nimpression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the\\nfuller’s-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at\\nmidnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand.\\nHowever, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to\\nPaddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to\\nholding my tongue.\\n“At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However,\\nI was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit\\nstation after eleven o’clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and\\nthere was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a\\nlantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my\\nacquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side.\\nWithout a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door\\nof which was standing open. He\\n287\\ndrew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away\\nwe went as fast as the horse could go.”\\n“One horse?” interjected Holmes.\\n“Yes, only one.”\\n“Did you observ e the colour?”\\n“Yes, I saw it by the side-ligh ts when I was stepping into the carriage. It\\nwas a chestnut.”\\n“Tired-looking o r fresh?”\\n“Oh, fresh and glossy.”\\n“Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most\\ninteresting statement.”\\n“Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander\\nStark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate\\nthat we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have\\nbeen nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was\\naware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking\\nat me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in\\nthat part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out\\nof the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of\\nfrosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur\\nof a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the\\nmonotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables,\\nand the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the\\nroad was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the\\ncarriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I\\nfollowed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of\\nus. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that\\nI failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The\\ninstant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us,\\nand I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.\\n“It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about lo oking\\nfor matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the\\nother end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our\\ndirection. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand,\\nwhich she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.\\nI could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light\\nshone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a\\nfew words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and\\nwhen my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start\\nthat the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her,\\nwhispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room\\nfrom whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in\\nhis hand.\\n“‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few\\nminutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly\\nfurnished room, with a round table in the\\n289\\ncentre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid\\ndown the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep\\nyou waiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.\\n“I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of\\nGerman I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others\\nbeing volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I\\nmight catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily\\nbarred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was\\nan old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise\\neverything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal\\nover me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living\\nin this strange, outof-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten\\nmiles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east,\\nor west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large\\ntowns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after\\nall. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the\\ncountry. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to\\nkeep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fiftyguinea\\nfee.\\n“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness,\\nthe door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the\\naperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp\\nbeating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she\\nwas sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up\\none shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered\\nwords of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a\\nfrightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\\n“‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; ‘I\\nwould go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.’\\n“‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for.\\nI cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’ “‘It is not worth your\\nwhile to wait,’ she went on. ‘You can\\npass through the door; no one hinders .’ And then, seeing that\\nI smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her\\nconstraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung\\ntogether. ‘For the love of Heaven!’ she whispered, ‘get aw ay\\nfrom here before it is too late!’\\n“But I am somewhat headstron g by nature, and the more\\nready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the\\nway. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journ ey, and of the\\nunpleasant night which seemed to be before\\nme. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away\\nwithout having carried out my commission, and without th e\\npayment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew,\\nbe a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her\\n291\\nmanner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head\\nand declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to\\nrenew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of\\nseveral footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant,\\nthrew up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and\\nas noiselessly as she had come.\\n“The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a\\nchinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was\\nintroduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\\n“‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel. ‘By the way, I was\\nunder the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have\\nfelt the draught.’\\n“‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door myself because I felt the room\\nto be a little close.’\\n“He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘Perhaps we had better proceed\\nto business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the\\nmachine.’\\n“‘I had be tter put my hat on, I suppose.’\\n“‘Oh, no, it is in the house.’\\n“‘What, you dig fuller’s-ear th in the house?’\\n“‘No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we\\nwish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong\\nwith it.’\\n“We we nt upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager\\nand I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors,\\npassages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of\\nwhich were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There\\nwere no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while\\nthe plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in\\ngreen, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as\\npossible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I\\ndisregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions.\\nFerguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the\\nlittle that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.\\n“Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he\\nunlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could\\nhardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered\\nme in.\\n“‘We a re now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be\\na particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The\\nceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and\\nit comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are\\nsmall lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which\\ntransmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The\\nmachine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of\\nit, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to\\nlook it over and to show us how we can set it right.’\\n293\\n“I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It\\nwas indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure.\\nWhen I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which\\ncontrolled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight\\nleakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side\\ncylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which\\nwas round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the\\nsocket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of\\npower, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks\\nvery carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should\\nproceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the\\nmain chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own\\ncuriosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was\\nthe merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an\\nengine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of\\nwood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to\\nexamine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped\\nand was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered\\nexclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking\\ndown at me.\\n“‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.\\n“I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he\\nhad told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’searth,’ said I; ‘I think that I should\\nbe better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact\\npurpose was for which it was used.’\\n“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech.\\nHis face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\\n“‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’ He took a\\nstep backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I\\nrushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did\\nnot give in the least to my kicks and shoves. ‘Hullo!’ I yelled. ‘Hullo!\\nColonel! Let me out!’\\n“And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into\\nmy mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking\\ncylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor\\nwhere I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the\\nblack ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew\\nbetter than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a\\nshapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged\\nwith my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the\\nremorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only\\na foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its\\nhard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that\\n295\\nthe pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I\\nmet it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I\\nshuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and\\nyet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering\\ndown upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught\\nsomething which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\\n“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of\\nwood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow\\nlight between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small\\npanel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here\\nwas indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw\\nmyself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had\\nclosed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments\\nafterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had\\nbeen my escape.\\n“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found\\nmyself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent\\nover me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her\\nright. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly\\nrejected.\\n“‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They will be here in a moment.\\nThey will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time,\\nbut come!’\\n“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and\\nran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to\\nanother broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of\\nrunning feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from\\nthe floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped\\nand looked about her like one who is at her wit’s end. Then she threw open\\na door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon\\nwas shining brightly.\\n“‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high, but it may be that you can\\njump it.’\\n“As she s poke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and\\nI saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a\\nlantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s cleaver in the other. I\\nrushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How\\nquiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it\\ncould not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I\\nhesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour\\nand the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was\\ndetermined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed\\nthrough my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but\\nshe threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\\n“‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember your prom\\n297 ise after the last time. You sai d it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh,\\nhe will be silent!’\\n“‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her. ‘You\\nwill be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!’ He dashed\\nher to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy\\nweapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when\\nhis blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell\\ninto the garden below.\\n“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off\\namong the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far\\nfrom being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly\\ndizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which\\nwas throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had\\nbeen cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured\\nto tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my\\nears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.\\n“How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very\\nlong time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when\\nI came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve\\nwas drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it\\nrecalled in an instant all the particulars of my night’s adventure, and I\\nsprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my\\npursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither\\nhouse nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge\\nclose by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building,\\nwhich proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had\\narrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my\\nhand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an\\nevil dream.\\n“Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.\\nThere would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was\\non duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him\\nwhether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was\\nstrange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me?\\nNo, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one\\nabout three miles off.\\n“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until\\nI got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past\\nsix when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the\\ndoctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your\\nhands and shall do exactly what you advise.”\\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this\\nextraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf\\none of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.\\n299\\n“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he. “It appeared in\\nall the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: ‘Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr.\\nJeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings\\nat ten o’clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,’\\netc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have\\nhis machine overhauled, I fancy.”\\n“Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that explains what the girl said.”\\n“Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperat e\\nman, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way\\nof his little game, like those outand-out pirates who will leave no survivor\\nfrom a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel\\nequal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to\\nstarting for Eyford.”\\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound\\nfrom Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes,\\nthe hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plainclothes\\nman, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the\\ncounty out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle\\nwith Eyford for its centre.\\n“There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from\\nthe village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said\\nten miles, I think, sir.” “It was an hour’s good drive.”\\n“And you think that they brought you back all tha t way when you were\\nunconscious?”\\n“They must ha ve done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been\\nlifted and conveyed somewhere.”\\n“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have spared you\\nwhen they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was\\nsoftened by the woman’s entreaties.”\\n“I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life.”\\n“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet. “Well, I have draw n\\nmy circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are\\nin search of are to be found.”\\n“I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes quietly.\\n“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed yo ur opinion! Come,\\nnow, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is\\nmore deserted there.”\\n“And I say east,” said my patient.\\n“I am for west,” remarked the pl ain-clothes man. “There are several quiet\\nlittle villages up there.”\\n“And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hills there, and our\\nfriend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.”\\n“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very p retty diversity of\\nopinion. We have boxed the compass among us.\\n301\\nWho do you give your casting vote to?”\\n“You are all wrong.”\\n“But we can’t all be.”\\n“Oh, yes, you can. Th is is my point.” He placed his finger\\nin the centre of the circle. “This is where we shall find them.” “But the\\ntwelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley. “Six out and six back. Nothing\\nsimpler. You say yourself\\nthat the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if\\nit had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?” “Indeed, it is a likely ruse\\nenough,” observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. “Of course there can be no\\ndoubt as to the nature of this gang.”\\n“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large scale, and have\\nused the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.”\\n“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the\\ninspector. “They have been turning out halfcrowns by the thousand. We\\neven traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had\\ncovered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But\\nnow, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right\\nenough.”\\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall\\ninto the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic\\ncolumn of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in\\nthe neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the\\nlandscape.\\n“A house on fire?” asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its\\nway.\\n“Yes , sir!” said the station-master.\\n“When did it break out?”\\n“I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole\\nplace is in a blaze.”\\n“Whose house is it? ”\\n“Dr. Becher’s.”\\n“Tell me,” brok e in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a\\nlong, sharp nose?”\\nThe station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman,\\nand there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he\\nhas a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a\\nforeigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no\\nharm.”\\nThe sta tion-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening\\nin the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great\\nwidespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every\\nchink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were\\nvainly striving to keep the flames under.\\n“That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. “There is the graveldrive,\\nand there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the\\none that I jumped from.”\\n303\\n“Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge upon them.\\nThere can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was\\ncrushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they\\nwere too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep\\nyour eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very\\nmuch fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.”\\nAnd Holmes’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word\\nhas ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or\\nthe morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart\\ncontaining several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the\\ndirection of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and\\neven Holmes’ ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their\\nwhereabouts.\\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which\\nthey had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed\\nhuman thumb upon a windowsill of the second floor. About sunset,\\nhowever, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames,\\nbut not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to\\nsuch absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a\\ntrace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate\\nacquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered\\nstored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have\\nexplained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already\\nreferred to.\\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot\\nwhere he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were\\nit not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently\\nbeen carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet\\nand the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that\\nthe silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his\\ncompanion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the\\nway of danger.\\n“Well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more\\nto London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I\\nhave lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”\\n“Experience,” said Holmes, laughing. “Indirectly it may be of value, you\\nknow; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being\\nexcellent company for the remainder of your existence.”\\n10.\\nThe Adventure of the Noble Bachelor.\\nThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased\\nto be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate\\nbridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant\\ndetails have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I\\nhave reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed\\nto the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable\\nshare in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be\\ncomplete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.\\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was\\nstill sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an\\nafternoon stroll to find a\\n305\\nletter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the\\nweather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the\\nJezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my\\nAfghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one\\neasychair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud\\nof newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them\\nall aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the\\nenvelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble\\ncorrespondent could be.\\n“Here is a very fashionable epistle,” I remarked as he entered. “Your\\nmorning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tidewaiter.”\\n“Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” he answered,\\nsmiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like\\none of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to\\nbe bored or to lie.”\\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\\n“Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.”\\n“Not social, then?”\\n“No, distinctly prof essional.”\\n“And from a noble client?”\\n“One of the highest in Engl and.”\\n307\\n“My dear fellow, I congratulate you.”\\n“I assure you, Watson, without affect ation, that the status of my client is a\\nmatter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible,\\nhowever, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You\\nhave been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?”\\n“It looks like it,” said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. “I\\nhave had nothing else to do.”\\n“It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing\\nexcept the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always\\ninstructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have\\nread about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?”\\n“Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.”\\n“That is well. The letter which I hol d in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I\\nwill read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me\\nhave whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:\\n“‘MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:—Lord Backw ater tells me that\\nI may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have\\ndetermined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to\\nthe very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding.\\nMr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he\\nassures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even\\nthinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o’clock in the\\nafternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope\\nthat you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours\\nfaithfully, ST. SIMON.’\\n“It is dated from Grosv enor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the\\nnoble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side\\nof his right little finger,” remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.\\n“He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.”\\n“Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon th e subject.\\nTurn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while\\nI take a glance as to who our client is.” He picked a red-covered volume\\nfrom a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. “Here he is,” said\\nhe, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. “‘Lord Robert\\nWalsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.’\\nHum! ‘Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.’\\nHe’s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was UnderSecretary\\nfor the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was\\nat one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by\\ndirect descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very\\ninstructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something\\nmore solid.”\\n“I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,” said I,\\n309\\n“for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I\\nfeared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on\\nhand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.”\\n“Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.\\nThat is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the first.\\nPray give me the results of your newspaper selections.”\\n“Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the\\nMorning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: ‘A marriage has\\nbeen arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take\\nplace, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral,\\nand Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San\\nFrancisco, Cal., U.S.A.’ That is all.”\\n“Terse and to the point,” remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs\\ntowards the fire.\\n“There was a pa ragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the\\nsame week. Ah, here it is: ‘There will soon be a call for protection in the\\nmarriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily\\nagainst our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses\\nof Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the\\nAtlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the\\nlist of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders.\\nLord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against\\nthe little god’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching\\nmarriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California\\nmillionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted\\nmuch attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is\\ncurrently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six\\nfigures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the\\nDuke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few\\nyears, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small\\nestate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only\\ngainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common\\ntransition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.’”\\n“Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning.\\n“Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another not e in the Morning Post to say that\\nthe marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St.\\nGeorge’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be\\ninvited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster\\nGate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later—that is,\\non Wednesday last—there is a curt announcement that the wedding had\\ntaken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater’s\\nplace, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the\\ndisappearance of the bride.”\\n311\\n“Before the what?” asked Holmes with a start. “The vanishing of the lady.”\\n“When did she vanish, then?”\\n“At the wedding breakfast.”\\n“Indeed. This is more interes ting than it promised to be;\\nquite dramatic, in fact.”\\n“Yes; it struck me as be ing a little out of the common.” “They often vanish\\nbefore the ceremony, and occasionally\\nduring the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt\\nas this. Pray let me have the details.” “I warn you that they are very\\nincomplete.”\\n“Perhaps we may make them less so.”\\n“Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of\\nyesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, ‘Singular Occurrence at a\\nFashionable Wedding’:\\n“‘The family of Lord R obert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest\\nconsternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in\\nconnection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the\\npapers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now\\nthat it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so\\npersistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the\\nmatter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good\\npurpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject\\nfor conversation.\\n“‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s, Hanover Square,\\nwas a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr.\\nAloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace\\nand Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the\\nbridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded\\nafterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where\\nbreakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused\\nby a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to\\nforce her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had\\nsome claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged\\nscene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who\\nhad fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had\\nsat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden\\nindisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused\\nsome comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she\\nhad only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and\\nbonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that\\nhe had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit\\nthat it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On\\nascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in\\nconjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in\\ncommunication with the police, and very energetic inquiries\\n313\\nare being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this\\nvery singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had\\ntranspired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of\\nfoul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of\\nthe woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from\\njealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange\\ndisappearance of the bride.’”\\n“And is that all?”\\n“Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive\\none.”\\n“And it is—”\\n“That Miss F lora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has\\nactually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the\\nAllegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are\\nno further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now—so far as it\\nhas been set forth in the public press.”\\n“And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have\\nmissed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock\\nmakes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be\\nour noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer\\nhaving a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.”\\n“Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throw ing open the door.\\nA gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale,\\nwith something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady,\\nwell-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command\\nand to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance\\ngave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a\\nlittle bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very\\ncurly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As\\nto his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar,\\nblack frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and\\nlight-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head\\nfrom left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his\\ngolden eyeglasses. “Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising and\\nbowing. “Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr.\\nWatson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”\\n“A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine , Mr.\\nHolmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already\\nmanaged several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they\\nwere hardly from the same class of society.”\\n“No, I am descending.”\\n“I beg pardon.”\\n“My last client of the sort was a king.”\\n“Oh, really! I had no idea. And which k ing?”\\n315\\n“The King of Scandinavia.”\\n“What! Had he lost his wife ?”\\n“You can understand,” said Ho lmes suavely, “that I extend\\nto the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in\\nyours.”\\n“Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my own\\ncase, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in\\nforming an opinion.”\\n“Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing\\nmore. I presume that I may take it as correct— this article, for example, as\\nto the disappearance of the bride.”\\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.”\\n“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an\\nopinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning\\nyou.”\\n“Pray do so.”\\n“When did yo u first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”\\n“In San Francisco, a year ago.”\\n“You were travelling in the Stat es?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Did y ou become engaged then?”\\n“No.”\\n“But y ou were on a friendly footing?”\\n“I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”\\n“Her father is very rich?”\\n“He is said to be the rich est man on the Pacific slope.” “And how did he\\nmake his money?”\\n“In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested\\nit, and came up by leaps and bounds.”\\n“Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s— your wife’s\\ncharacter?”\\nThe noblem an swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire.\\n“You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before her father\\nbecame a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and\\nwandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come\\nfrom Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in\\nEngland a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any\\nsort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say. She is\\nswift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On\\nthe other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the\\nhonour to bear”—he gave a little stately cough—”had not I thought her to\\nbe at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic selfsacrifice\\nand that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.”\\n“Have you her photograph?”\\n“I brought this with me.” He opened a locket and showed us the full face of\\na very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and\\nthe artist had brought out\\n317\\nthe full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the\\nexquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the\\nlocket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\\n“The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your\\nacquaintance?”\\n“Yes, her fathe r brought her over for this last London season. I met her\\nseveral times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.”\\n“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”\\n“A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.”\\n“And this, of course, remains to you, since the marria ge is a fait accompli?”\\n“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”\\n“Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Dora n on the day before the\\nwedding?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Was s he in good spirits?”\\n“Never better. She kept talk ing of what we should do in our future lives.”\\n“Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?”\\n“She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony.”\\n“And did you observe any change in her then?”\\n“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her\\ntemper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate\\nand can have no possible bearing upon the case.”\\n“Pray let us have it, for all that.”\\n“Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry.\\nShe was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew.\\nThere was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to\\nher again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I\\nspoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage,\\non our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.”\\n“Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the\\ngeneral public were present, then?”\\n“Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.”\\n“This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”\\n“No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a commonlooking\\nperson. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we\\nare wandering rather far from the point.”\\n“Lady St. Simon, then, returned from th e wedding in a less cheerful frame\\nof mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father’s\\nhouse?”\\n“I saw h er in conversation with her maid.”\\n“And who is her maid?”\\n319 “Alice is her name. She is an American and came from\\nCalifornia with her.”\\n“A confidential serva nt?”\\n“A little too much so. It se emed to me that her mistress\\nallowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look\\nupon these things in a different way.”\\n“How long did she speak to this Alice ?”\\n“Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.” “You did not\\noverhear what they said?”\\n“Lady St. Simon said som ething about ‘jumping a claim.’\\nShe was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she\\nmeant.”\\n“American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do\\nwhen she finished speaking to her maid?”\\n“She walked into the breakfast-room.”\\n“On your arm?”\\n“No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after\\nwe had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some\\nwords of apology, and left the room. She never came back.”\\n“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she we nt to her room,\\ncovered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.”\\n“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in\\ncompany with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had\\nalready made a disturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.”\\n“Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lad y, and your\\nrelations to her.”\\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We have\\nbeen on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a very friendly\\nfooting. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously,\\nand she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what\\nwomen are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly\\nhotheaded and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters\\nwhen she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the\\nreason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest\\nthere might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran’s door just\\nafter we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very\\nabusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had\\nforeseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police\\nfellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was\\nquiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.”\\n“Did your wife hear all this?”\\n“No, thank goodness, she did not.”\\n“And she was seen walking with th is very woman afterwards?”\\n“Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon a s so serious.\\nIt is thought that Flora decoyed my wife\\n321\\nout and laid some terrible trap for her.”\\n“Well, it is a possible supposition.”\\n“You think so, too?”\\n“I did not say a prob able one. But you do not yourself look\\nupon this as likely?”\\n“I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”\\n“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray\\nwhat is your own theory as to what took place?”\\n“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to prop ound one.\\nI have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may\\nsay that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement\\nof this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immens e\\na social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous\\ndisturbance in my wife.”\\n“In short, that she had b ecome suddenly deranged?” “Well, really, when I\\nconsider that she has turned her back—\\nI will not say upon me, but upon so muc h that many have\\naspired to without success—I can hardly explain it in any other\\nfashion.”\\n“Well, ce rtainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said\\nHolmes, smiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I\\nhave nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seate d at\\nthe breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?” “ We could see\\nthe other side of the road and the Park.” “Quite so. Then I do not think that I\\nneed to detain you\\nlonger. I shall com municate with you.”\\n“Should you be fortunate enough to sol ve this problem,”\\nsaid our client, rising.\\n“I have solved it.”\\n“Eh? What was tha t?”\\n“I say that I have solve d it.”\\n“Where, then, is my wife?”\\n“That is a detail which I sh all speedily supply.” Lord St. Simon shook his\\nhead. “I am afraid that it will\\ntake wiser heads than yours o r mine,” he remarked, and bowing in a stately,\\nold-fashioned manner he departed. “It is very good of Lord St. Simon to\\nhonour my head by\\nputting it on a level with his own,” said Sherlock Holmes,\\nlaughing. “I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a\\ncigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conc lusions as to the\\ncase before our client came into the room.” “My dear Holmes!”\\n“I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I\\nremarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination\\nserved to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is\\noccasionally very convincing, as when\\nyou find a trout in the milk, to quote Th oreau’s example.” “But I have heard\\nall that you have heard.”\\n“Without, however, the k nowledge of pre-existing cases\\nwhich serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some\\nyears back, and something on very much the same\\nlines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is\\n323\\none of these cases—but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade!\\nYou will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in\\nthe box.”\\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him\\na decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his\\nhand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had\\nbeen offered to him.\\n“What’s up, then?” asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. “You look\\ndissatisfied.”\\n“And I feel d issatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can\\nmake neither head nor tail of the business.”\\n“Really! You surprise me.”\\n“Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through\\nmy fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.”\\n“And very wet it seems to have made you,” sa id Holmes laying his hand\\nupon the arm of the pea-jacket.\\n“Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.”\\n“In heaven’s name, what for?”\\n“In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.”\\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair a nd laughed heartily.\\n“Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?” he asked.\\n“Why? What do you mean?”\\n“Because you have just as go od a chance of finding this lady in the one as\\nin the other.”\\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. “I suppose you know all\\nabout it,” he snarled.\\n“Well, I have only ju st heard the facts, but my mind is made up.”\\n“Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no p art in the\\nmatter?”\\n“I think i t very unlikely.”\\n“Then perhaps you will k indly explain how it is that we found this in it?”\\nHe opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress\\nof watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride’s wreath and veil, all\\ndiscoloured and soaked in water. “There,” said he, putting a new weddingring\\nupon the top of the pile. “There is a little nut for you to crack, Master\\nHolmes.”\\n“Oh, inde ed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. “You dragged\\nthem from the Serpentine?”\\n“No. They were found float ing near the margin by a parkkeeper. They have\\nbeen identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were\\nthere the body would not be far off.”\\n“By the same brilliant reasoning, ev ery man’s body is to be found in the\\nneighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at\\nthrough this?”\\n“At some evid ence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.”\\n325\\n“I am afraid that you will find it difficult.”\\n“Are you, indeed, now?” cried Lestrade w ith some bitterness. “I am afraid,\\nHolmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your\\ninferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress\\ndoes implicate Miss Flora Millar.”\\n“And how?”\\n“In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a\\nnote. And here is the very note.” He slapped it down upon the table in front\\nof him. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when all is ready. Come at once.\\nF.H.M.’ Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was\\ndecoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt,\\nwas responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the\\nvery note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and\\nwhich lured her within their reach.”\\n“Very good, Lestrade,” said Holm es, laughing. “You really are very fine\\nindeed. Let me see it.” He took up the paper in a listless way, but his\\nattention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction.\\n“This is indeed important,” said he.\\n“Ha! you find it so?”\\n“Extremely so. I cong ratulate you warmly.”\\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his he ad to look. “Why,” he shrieked,\\n“you’re looking at the wrong side!”\\n“On the contrary, this is the right sid e.”\\n“The right side? You’re mad! Here is th e note written in pencil over here.”\\n“And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, whic h\\ninterests me deeply.”\\n“There’s nothing in it. I looked at it before,” said Lestrade. “‘Oct. 4th,\\nrooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.’ I\\nsee nothing in that.”\\n“Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is\\nimportant also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.”\\n“I’ve wasted time enough,” said Lestrade, rising. “I believe in hard work\\nand not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes,\\nand we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.” He gathered\\nup the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.\\n“Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes before his riva l vanished;\\n“I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth.\\nThere is not, and there never has been, any such person.”\\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his\\nforehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his\\novercoat. “There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,”\\nhe remarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a\\nlittle.”\\n327\\nIt was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time\\nto be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s man with a\\nvery large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had\\nbrought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite\\nepicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble\\nlodginghouse mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a\\npheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby\\nbottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away,\\nlike the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the\\nthings had been paid for and were ordered to this address.\\nJust before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.\\nHis features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made\\nme think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\\n“They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands. “You seem to\\nexpect company. They have laid for five.” “Yes, I fancy we may have some\\ncompany dropping in,”\\nsaid he. “I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I\\nfancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.” It was indeed our visitor of\\nthe afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously\\nthan ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic\\nfeatures. “My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.\\n“Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you\\ngood authority for what you say?” “The best possible.”\\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand ov er\\nhis forehead.\\n“What will th e Duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears\\nthat one of the family has been subjected to such humiliat ion?”\\n“It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any\\nhumiliation.”\\n“Ah, you loo k on these things from another standpoint.” “I fail to see that\\nanyone is to blame. I can hardly see how\\nthe lady could have acted otherwise, thou gh her abrupt method\\nof doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother,\\nshe had no one to advise her at such a crisis.”\\n“It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon,\\ntapping his fingers upon the table.\\n“You must make allowance for thi s poor girl, placed in so\\nunprecedented a position.”\\n“I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I\\nhave been shamefully used.”\\n“I think that I heard a ring,” s aid Holmes. “Yes, there are\\nsteps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a le nient\\nview of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advoc ate here who\\nmay be more successful.” He opened the door\\nand ushered in a lady and gentleman. “Lord St . Simon,” said\\nhe “allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay\\n329 Moulton. The lady, I think, yo u have already met.”\\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and\\nstood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast\\nof his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick\\nstep forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise\\nhis eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was\\none which it was hard to resist.\\n“You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess you have every cause to\\nbe.”\\n“Pra y make no apology to me,” said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\\n“Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and tha t I should have\\nspoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time\\nwhen I saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was doing or saying.\\nI only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.”\\n“Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave th e\\nroom while you explain this matter?”\\n“If I may give an opinion,” remarke d the strange gentleman, “we’ve had\\njust a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I\\nshould like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.” He was a small,\\nwiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.\\n“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady. “Frank here and I met in\\n’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where pa was working a claim.\\nWe were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck\\na rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that\\npetered out and came to nothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank;\\nso at last pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he\\ntook me away to ‘Frisco. Frank wouldn’t throw up his hand, though; so he\\nfollowed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it. It\\nwould only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for\\nourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never\\ncome back to claim me until he had as much as pa. So then I promised to\\nwait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else\\nwhile he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be married right away, then,’ said he,\\n‘and then I will feel sure of you; and I won’t claim to be your husband until\\nI come back?’ Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely,\\nwith a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and\\nthen Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa.\\n“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went\\nprospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After\\nthat came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been\\nattacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the\\nkilled. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought\\nI had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ‘Frisco. Not a\\n331\\nword of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank\\nwas really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to ‘Frisco, and we came to\\nLondon, and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt all\\nthe time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that\\nhad been given to my poor Frank.\\n“Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my duty by\\nhim. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar\\nwith him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me\\nto be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar\\nrails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the\\nfirst pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he\\nwas still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were\\nglad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was\\nturning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a\\nbee in my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make\\na scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what\\nI was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then\\nI saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a\\nnote. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to\\nhim, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers.\\nIt was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do\\nso. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to\\nhim, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.\\n“When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and\\nhad always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few\\nthings packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord\\nSt. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great\\npeople. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I\\nhadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at\\nthe other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into\\nthe Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman\\ncame talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me—seemed to\\nme from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before\\nmarriage also—but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook\\nFrank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he\\nhad taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those\\nyears of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had\\nescaped, came on to ‘Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had\\ngone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the\\nvery morning of my second wedding.”\\n“I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It gave the name and the\\nchurch but not where the lady lived.”\\n“Then we had a talk as to what w e should do, and Frank was all for\\nopenness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as\\n333\\nif I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again— just\\nsending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to\\nme to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table\\nand waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and\\nthings and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and\\ndropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely\\nthat we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good\\ngentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he\\nfound us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly\\nthat I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting\\nourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a\\nchance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away\\nround to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am\\nvery sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very\\nmeanly of me.”\\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened\\nwith a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.\\n“Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate\\npersonal affairs in this public manner.”\\n“Then you won’t forgive me? You won ’t shake hands before I go?”\\n“Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” He put out his h and and\\ncoldly grasped that which she extended to him.\\n“I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you would have joined us in a\\nfriendly supper.”\\n“I think that ther e you ask a little too much,” responded his Lordship. “I\\nmay be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly\\nbe expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I\\nwill now wish you all a very good-night.” He included us all in a sweeping\\nbow and stalked out of the room.\\n“Then I trust that you at least w ill honour me with your company,” said\\nSherlock Holmes. “It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for\\nI am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the\\nblundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from\\nbeing some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which\\nshall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.”\\n“The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes when ou r visitors\\nhad left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how simple the\\nexplanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost\\ninexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as\\nnarrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for\\ninstance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.”\\n“You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”\\n“From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one\\n335\\nthat the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the\\nother that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.\\nObviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to\\nchange her mind. What could that something be? She could not have\\nspoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the\\nbridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone\\nfrom America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she\\ncould hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her\\nthat the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so\\ncompletely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at\\nthe idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this\\nAmerican be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It\\nmight be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I\\nknew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had\\ngot before I ever heard Lord St. Simon’s narrative. When he told us of a\\nman in a pew, of the change in the bride’s manner, of so transparent a\\ndevice for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her\\nconfidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—\\nwhich in miners’ parlance means taking possession of that which another\\nperson has a prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear.\\nShe had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a\\nprevious husband—the chances being in favour of the latter.”\\n“And how in the world did you find them?”\\n“It might have been difficult, but friend L estrade held information in his\\nhands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of\\ncourse, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know\\nthat within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London\\nhotels.”\\n“How d id you deduce the select?”\\n“By the select prices. Eight shillin gs for a bed and eightpence for a glass of\\nsherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in\\nLondon which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in\\nNorthumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis\\nH. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on\\nlooking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I\\nhad seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226\\nGordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the\\nloving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to\\npoint out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make\\ntheir position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St.\\nSimon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I\\nmade him keep the appointment.”\\n“But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His conduct was certainly not\\nvery gracious.”\\n“Ah, Watson,” s aid Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would\\n337\\nnot be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding,\\nyou found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that\\nwe may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we\\nare never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up\\nand hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how\\nto while away these bleak autumnal evenings.”\\n11.\\nThe Adventure of the Beryl Coronet.\\n“Holmes,” said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down\\nthe street, “here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his\\nrelatives should allow him to come out alone.”\\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the\\npockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright,\\ncrisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon\\nthe ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of\\nBaker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic,\\nbut at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as\\nwhite as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but\\nwas still dangerously slip\\n339\\npery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the\\ndirection of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single\\ngentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive,\\nstrongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a\\nsombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters,\\nand well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to\\nthe dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with\\noccasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed\\nto set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down,\\nwaggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary\\ncontortions.\\n“What on earth can be the matter with him?” I asked. “He is looking up at\\nthe numbers of the houses.”\\n“I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\\n“Here?”\\n“Yes; I r ather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I\\nrecognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?” As he spoke, the man,\\npuffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the\\nwhole house resounded with the clanging.\\nA few moments later he was in our room , still puffing, still gesticulating,\\nbut with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were\\nturned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his\\nwords out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has\\nbeen driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to\\nhis feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both\\nrushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock\\nHolmes pushed him down into the easychair and, sitting beside him, patted\\nhis hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so\\nwell how to employ.\\n“You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?” said he. “You are\\nfatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and\\nthen I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may\\nsubmit to me.”\\nThe man sat fo r a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his\\nemotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight,\\nand turned his face towards us.\\n“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.\\n“I see that you have had some great trou ble,” responded Holmes.\\n“God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so\\nsudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I\\nam a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction\\nalso is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful\\na form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I\\n341 alone. The very noblest in th e land may suffer unless some way be found\\nout of this horrible affair.”\\n“Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have a clear account\\nof who you are and what it is that has befallen you.”\\n“My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to your ears. I am\\nAlexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of\\nThreadneedle Street.”\\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in\\nthe second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What\\ncould have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London\\nto this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort\\nhe braced himself to tell his story.\\n“I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I hastened here when the\\npolice inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to\\nBaker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the\\ncabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I\\nam a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the\\nfacts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\\n“It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as\\nmuch depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our\\nfunds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our\\ndepositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the\\nshape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good\\ndeal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble\\nfamilies to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their\\npictures, libraries, or plate.\\n“Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was\\nbrought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it\\nwas that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I had better say no\\nmore than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth—\\none of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was\\noverwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but\\nhe plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry\\nquickly through a disagreeable task.\\n“‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed that you are in the habit of\\nadvancing money.’\\n“‘The firm does so when the security is good.’ I answered.\\n“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I sho uld have 50,000\\npounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over\\nfrom my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to\\ncarry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand\\nthat it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’\\n“‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I a sked.\\n“‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most\\ncertainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right\\nto charge. But it is very essential to\\n343\\nme that the money should be paid at once.’\\n“‘I should be happy to advance it without fu rther parley\\nfrom my own private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain\\nwould be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand,\\nI am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my\\npartner I must insist that, even in your case, every busines slike\\nprecaution should be taken.’\\n“‘I should much prefer to ha ve it so,’ said he, raising up a\\nsquare, black morocco case which he had laid beside his c hair.\\n‘You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’ “‘One of the most\\nprecious public possessions of the empire,’ said I.\\n“‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbed ded in\\nsoft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery\\nwhich he had named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’\\nsaid he, ‘and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The\\nlowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double\\nthe sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with yo u\\nas my security.’\\n“I took the preci ous case into my hands and looked in some\\nperplexity from it to my illustrious client.\\n“‘You doubt its value?’ he asked.\\n“‘Not at all. I only doubt—’\\n“‘The propriety of my leavin g it. You may set your mind at\\nrest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not\\nabsolutely certain that I should be able in four days to recl aim\\nit. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?’ “‘Am ple.’\\n“‘You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong\\nproof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon a ll\\nthat I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discree t\\nand to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to\\npreserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I\\nneed not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any\\nharm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as\\nserious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the w orld\\nto match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I\\nleave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shal l\\ncall for it in person on Monday morning.’\\n“Seeing that my client was anxious to leav e, I said no more\\nbut, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1 000\\npound notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the\\nprecious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not\\nbut think with some misgivings of the immense responsibilit y\\nwhich it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it\\nwas a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if\\nany misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having\\never consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to\\nalter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and\\nturned once more to my work.\\n“When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence\\nto leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Banke rs’\\n345\\nsafes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how\\nterrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined,\\ntherefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case\\nbackward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my\\nreach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at\\nStreatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had\\ntaken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressingroom.\\n“And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to\\nthoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of\\nthe house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who\\nhave been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite\\nabove suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only\\nbeen in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character,\\nhowever, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and\\nhas attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is\\nthe only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a\\nthoroughly good girl in every way.\\n“So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take\\nme long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has\\nbeen a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous disappointment. I\\nhave no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled\\nhim. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had\\nto love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his\\nface. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for\\nboth of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\\n“It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business,\\nbut he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the\\ntruth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he\\nwas young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having\\ncharming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long\\npurses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to\\nsquander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and\\nimplore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle\\nhis debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the\\ndangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of\\nhis friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\\n“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell\\nshould gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my\\nhouse, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of\\nhis manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips,\\none who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man\\nof great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in\\n347\\ncold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced\\nfrom his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he\\nis one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my\\nlittle Mary, who has a woman’s quick insight into character.\\n“And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my\\nbrother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and\\nhave looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my\\nhouse—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet\\nas tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I\\ndo not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever\\ngone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he\\nloves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if\\nanyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she,\\nand that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is\\ntoo late—forever too late!\\n“Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I\\nshall continue with my miserable story.\\n“When we were taking coffee in the dr awing-room that night after dinner, I\\ntold Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we\\nhad under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who\\nhad brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear\\nthat the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished\\nto see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\\n“‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.\\n“‘In my own bureau.’\\n“‘Well, I hope to goo dness the house won’t be burgled during the night.’\\nsaid he.\\n“‘It is lo cked up,’ I answered.\\n“‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have\\nopened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’\\n“He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought littl e of what he said.\\nHe followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\\n“‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me h ave\\n200 pounds?’\\n“‘No, I canno t!’ I answered sharply. ‘I have been far too generous with you\\nin money matters.’\\n“‘You have been v ery kind,’ said he, ‘but I must have this money, or else I\\ncan never show my face inside the club again.’\\n“‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.\\n“‘Yes, but you would not have me lea ve it a dishonoured man,’ said he. ‘I\\ncould not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you\\nwill not let me have it, then I must try other means.’\\n“I was very angry, for this was the third demand d uring the month. ‘You\\nshall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on\\n349\\nwhich he bowed and left the room without another word. “When he was\\ngone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that\\nmy treasure was safe, and locked it again. T hen I started to go\\nround the house to see that all was secure—a duty which I\\nusually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perfor m\\nmyself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary he rself at the side\\nwindow of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\\n“‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, ‘did you give\\nLucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’ “‘Certainly not.’\\n“‘She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt\\nthat she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I\\nthink that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.’ “‘You m ust speak to her\\nin the morning, or I will if you\\nprefer it. Are you sure that eve rything is fastened?’ “‘Quite sure, dad.’\\n“‘Then, good-night.’ I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, w here\\nI was soon asleep.\\n“I am endeavourin g to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes,\\nwhich may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg tha t you\\nwill question me upon any point which I do not make cl ear.” “On the\\ncontrary, your statement is singularly lucid.” “I come to a part of my story\\nnow in which I should wish to\\nbe particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my\\nmind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in\\nthe morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had\\nceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as\\nthough a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my\\nears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving\\nsoftly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and\\npeeped round the corner of my dressing\\nroom door.\\n“‘Arthur!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief! How dare you\\ntouch that coronet?’\\n“The gas was half up , as I had left it, and my unhappy boy,\\ndressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside t he\\nlight, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be\\nwrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry\\nhe dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I\\nsnatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, w ith\\nthree of the beryls in it, was missing.\\n“‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with rage. ‘You\\nhave destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where\\nare the jewels which you have stolen?’\\n“‘Stolen!’ he cried.\\n“‘Yes, thief!’ I roa red, shaking him by the shoulder. “‘There are none\\nmissing. There cannot be any missing,’\\nsaid he.\\n“‘There are three missing. And you know where they are.\\nMust I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying\\n351\\nto tear off another piece?’\\n“‘You have called me nam es enough,’ said he, ‘I will not\\nstand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this\\nbusiness, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave y our\\nhouse in the morning and make my own way in the world. ’ “‘You shall\\nleave it in the hands of the police!’ I cried halfmad with grief and rage. ‘I\\nshall have this matter probed to the\\nbottom.’\\n“‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he with a passion\\nsuch as I should not have thought was in his nature. ‘If you\\nchoose to call the police, let the police find what they can .’ “By this time\\nthe whole house was astir, for I had raised my\\nvoice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush i nto my room,\\nand, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur’s face, she read\\nthe whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on th e\\nground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the inve stigation into\\ntheir hands at once. When the inspector and a\\nconstable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly\\nwith his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to\\ncharge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a\\nprivate matter, but had become a public one, since the ruine d\\ncoronet was national property. I was determined that the law\\nshould have its way in everything.\\n“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not h ave me arrested at once. It\\nwould be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave t he\\nhouse for five minutes.’\\n“‘That you may get awa y, or perhaps that you may conceal\\nwhat you have stolen,’ said I. And then, realising the dread ful\\nposition in which I was placed, I implored him to remember\\nthat not only my honour but that of one who was far greater\\nthan I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal\\nwhich would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he\\nwould but tell me what he had done with the three missing\\nstones.\\n“‘You m ay as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been\\ncaught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt\\nmore heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in you r\\npower, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgive n\\nand forgotten.’\\n“‘Keep your fo rgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning\\naway from me with a sneer. I saw that he was\\ntoo hardened for any words of mine to influen ce him. There\\nwas but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him\\ninto custody. A search was made at once not only of his perso n\\nbut of his room and of every portion of the house where he\\ncould possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them\\ncould be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth\\nfor all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was\\nremoved to a cell, and I, after going through all the police f ormalities, have\\nhurried round to you to implore you to use your\\nskill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they\\ncan at present make nothing of it. You may go\\n353\\nto any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward\\nof 1000 pounds. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems,\\nand my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!”\\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro,\\ndroning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted\\nand his eyes fixed upon the fire.\\n“Do you receive much company ?” he asked.\\n“None save my partner with his family and a n occasional friend of Arthur’s.\\nSir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else, I think.”\\n“Do you go out much in society?”\\n“Arthur does. Mary and I stay at h ome. We neither of us care for it.”\\n“That is unusual in a young girl.”\\n“She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-andtwenty.”\\n“This ma tter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.”\\n“Terrible! She is even more affected than I.”\\n“You have neither of you any doubt as to you r son’s guilt?”\\n“How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes wi th the coronet in\\nhis hands.”\\n“I hardly co nsider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet\\nat all injured?”\\n“Yes, it was tw isted.”\\n“Do you not think, the n, that he might have been trying to straighten it?”\\n“God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But i t is\\ntoo heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were\\ninnocent, why did he not say so?” “Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did\\nhe not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are\\nseveral singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise\\nwhich awoke you from your sleep?”\\n“They considered that it might be c aused by Arthur’s closing his bedroom\\ndoor.”\\n“A lik ely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to\\nwake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these\\ngems?”\\n“They a re still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope\\nof finding them.”\\n“Have they thoug ht of looking outside the house?” “Yes, they have shown\\nextraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely\\nexamined.”\\n“Now, my dear sir,” said Holmes. “is it not obvious to you now that this\\nmatter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at\\nfirst inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems\\nexceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You sup\\n355\\npose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your\\ndressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by\\nmain force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed\\nthree gems out of the thirtynine, with such skill that nobody can find them,\\nand then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he\\nexposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now,\\nis such a theory tenable?”\\n“But what other is there?” cried the banker with a gesture of despair. “If his\\nmotives were innocent, why does he not explain them?”\\n“It is our task to find that out,” replied Holmes; “so now, if you please, Mr.\\nHolder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to\\nglancing a little more closely into details.”\\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which\\nI was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply\\nstirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the\\nbanker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father,\\nbut still I had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I felt that there must be\\nsome grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted\\nexplanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern\\nsuburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his\\neyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh\\nheart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he\\neven broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short\\nrailway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest\\nresidence of the great financier.\\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a\\nlittle from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,\\nstretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance.\\nOn the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path\\nbetween two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and\\nforming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the\\nstables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though\\nlittle used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked\\nslowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and\\nso round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr.\\nHolder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he\\nshould return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a\\nyoung lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with\\ndark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of\\nher skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a\\nwoman’s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with\\ncrying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater\\nsense of grief than the banker\\n357\\nhad done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was\\nevidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for selfrestraint.\\nDisregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and\\npassed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\\n“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?”\\nshe asked.\\n“No, no, m y girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”\\n“But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woma n’s instincts are.\\nI know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted\\nso harshly.”\\n“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”\\n“Who knows? Perhaps because he was s o angry that you should suspect\\nhim.”\\n“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the\\ncoronet in his hand?”\\n“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for\\nit that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful\\nto think of our dear Arthur in prison!”\\n“I shall never let it drop until the g ems are found—never, Mary! Your\\naffection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far\\nfrom hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London\\nto inquire more deeply into it.”\\n“This gentleman?” she asked, f acing round to me.\\n“No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable\\nlane now.”\\n“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he hope to find\\nthere? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in\\nproving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of\\nthis crime.”\\n“I fully sha re your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,”\\nreturned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes.\\n“I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask\\nyou a question or two?”\\n“Pray do, sir, if it may h elp to clear this horrible affair up.”\\n“You heard nothing yourself last night?”\\n“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I\\ncame down.”\\n“You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the\\nwindows?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Were they all fastened this morning?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“You h ave a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your\\nuncle last night that she had been out to see him?”\\n“Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the draw ing-room, and who may\\nhave heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”\\n359\\n“I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that\\nthe two may have planned the robbery.”\\n“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker\\nimpatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his\\nhands?”\\n“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss\\nHolder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”\\n“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her\\nslipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”\\n“Do you know him?”\\n“Oh, yes! he is the gre en-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His name\\nis Francis Prosper.”\\n“He stood,” said Ho lmes, “to the left of the door—that is to say, farther up\\nthe path than is necessary to reach the door?”\\n“Yes, he did.”\\n“And he is a m an with a wooden leg?”\\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black eyes.\\n“Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you know that?” She\\nsmiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’ thin, eager face.\\n“I should be very glad now to go upstairs,” said he. “I shall probably wish\\nto go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at\\nthe lower windows before I go up.”\\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large\\none which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and\\nmade a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying\\nlens. “Now we shall go upstairs,” said he at last.\\nThe banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furn ished little chamber, with a\\ngrey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau\\nfirst and looked hard at the lock.\\n“Which key was used to open it? ” he asked.\\n“That which my son himself indicated—tha t of the cupboard of the lumberroom.”\\n“Have y ou it here?”\\n“That is it on the dre ssing-table.”\\nSherlock Holmes took it up and o pened the bureau.\\n“It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder t hat it did not wake you.\\nThis case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it.” He\\nopened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a\\nmagnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and the thirty-six stones were\\nthe finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked\\nedge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\\n“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds to\\nthat which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it\\noff.”\\nThe b anker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” said he.\\n361\\n“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result.\\n“I feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though I am exceptionally strong in the\\nfingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not\\ndo it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder?\\nThere would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this\\nhappened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?”\\n“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”\\n“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss\\nHolder?”\\n“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”\\n“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you sa w him?”\\n“He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”\\n“Thank you. We have certainly been favoured w ith extraordinary luck\\nduring this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not\\nsucceed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall\\nnow continue my investigations outside.”\\nHe went alone, at his own request, for h e explained that any unnecessary\\nfootmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was\\nat work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as\\ninscrutable as ever.\\n“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,” said he; “I\\ncan serve you best by returning to my rooms.”\\n“But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?” “I cannot tell.”\\nThe banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” h e cried. “And\\nmy son? You give me hopes?”\\n“My opinion is in no way alter ed.”\\n“Then, for God’s sake, what was th is dark business which was acted in my\\nhouse last night?”\\n“If you can call u pon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning\\nbetween nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I\\nunderstand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that\\nI get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.”\\n“I would give my fortune to have them back.”\\n“Very good. I shall look into the matter betwe en this and then. Good-bye; it\\nis just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.”\\nIt was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up ab out\\nthe case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even\\ndimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured\\nto sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other\\ntopic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we\\nfound ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and\\nwas down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his\\ncollar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he\\nwas a perfect sample of\\n363\\nthe class.\\n“I think th at this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass\\nabove the fireplace. “I only wish that you could come with m e,\\nWatson, but I fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this\\nmatter, or I may be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall\\nsoon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few\\nhours.” He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the side board, sandwiched\\nit between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket\\nhe started off upon his expedition.\\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in\\nexcellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand.\\nHe chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup\\nof tea.\\n“I only looked in as I passed,” said he. “I am going right\\non.”\\n“Wh ere to?”\\n“Oh, to the o ther side of the West End. It may be some\\ntime before I get back. Don’t wait up for me in case I s hould be\\nlate.”\\n“How are you getting on?”\\n“Oh, so so. Nothing to com plain of. I have been out to\\nStreatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house.\\nIt is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it\\nfor a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but\\nmust get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly\\nrespectable self.”\\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for\\nsatisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes\\ntwinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow\\ncheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard\\nthe slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once\\nmore upon his congenial hunt.\\nI waited until midnight, but the re was no sign of his return,\\nso I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to\\nbe away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a\\nscent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not kno w\\nat what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast\\nin the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand\\nand the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible. “Y ou will excuse\\nmy beginning without you, Watson,” said\\nhe, “but you remember that our client ha s rather an early appointment this\\nmorning.”\\n“Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should not be\\nsurprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.” It was , indeed, our friend\\nthe financier. I was shocked by\\nthe change which had come ove r him, for his face which was\\nnaturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched an d\\nfallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter.\\nHe entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even mo re\\npainful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped\\nheavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.\\n365\\n“I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he. “Only\\ntwo days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the\\nworld. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes\\nclose upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.”\\n“Deserted you?”\\n“Yes. Her bed th is morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and\\na note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow\\nand not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well\\nwith him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark\\nthat she refers in this note:\\n“‘MY DEAREST UNCLE :—I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,\\nand that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have\\noccurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under\\nyour roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my\\nfuture, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it\\nwill be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever\\nyour loving,—MARY.’\\n“What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to\\nsuicide?”\\n“No, no, n othing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust,\\nMr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.”\\n“Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned\\nsomething! Where are the gems?”\\n“You would not think 1000 pound s apiece an excessive sum for them?”\\n“I would pay ten.”\\n“That would be u nnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And\\nthere is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a pen.\\nBetter make it out for 4000 pounds.”\\nWith a dazed face the banker made o ut the required check. Holmes walked\\nover to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in\\nit, and threw it down upon the table.\\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutch ed it up.\\n“You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am s aved!”\\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief ha d been, and he hugged\\nhis recovered gems to his bosom.\\n“There is one other thing you o we, Mr. Holder,” said Sherlock Holmes\\nrather sternly.\\n“Owe!” He ca ught up a pen. “Name the sum, and I will pay it.”\\n“No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble\\nlad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to\\nsee my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.”\\n“Then it was not Arthur who took them?”\\n“I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.”\\n“You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let\\n367\\nhim know that the truth is known.”\\n“He knows it already. When I had c leared it all up I had an\\ninterview with him, and finding that he would not tell me th e\\nstory, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was\\nright and to add the very few details which were not yet qui te\\nclear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open h is\\nlips.”\\n“For h eaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary\\nmystery!”\\n“I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached\\nit. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me\\nto say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding\\nbetween Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They h ave\\nnow fled together.”\\n“My Mary? Imposs ible!”\\n“It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your\\nson knew the true character of this man\\nwhen you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of\\nthe most dangerous men in England—a ruined gambler, an\\nabsolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscie nce.\\nYour niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his\\nvows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she f lattered herself\\nthat she alone had touched his heart. The devil\\nknows best what he said, but at least she becam e his tool and\\nwas in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.” “I can not, and I will\\nnot, believe it!” cried the banker with\\nan ashen face.\\n“I will tell you , then, what occurred in your house last night.\\nYour niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room ,\\nslipped down and talked to her lover through the window whic h\\nleads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right\\nthrough the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of\\nthe coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and\\nhe bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but\\nthere are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all\\nother loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had\\nhardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming\\ndownstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told\\nyou about one of the servants’ escapade with her wooden-leg ged\\nlover, which was all perfectly true.\\n“Your boy, Arthur, went to bed afte r his interview with you\\nbut he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his clu b\\ndebts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his\\ndoor, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cou sin\\nwalking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared\\ninto your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad\\nslipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see\\nwhat would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerg ed\\nfrom the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your\\nson saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She\\npassed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along\\nand slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he coul d\\n369\\nsee what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window,\\nhand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once\\nmore hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid\\nbehind the curtain.\\n“As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a\\nhorrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she\\nwas gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and\\nhow all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in\\nhis bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down\\nthe lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George\\nBurnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle\\nbetween them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent\\nat the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the\\neye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had\\nthe coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your\\nroom, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the\\nstruggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the\\nscene.”\\n“Is it possible?” gasped the banker.\\n“You then roused his anger by calli ng him names at a moment when he felt\\nthat he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true\\nstate of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough\\nconsideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and\\npreserved her secret.”\\n“And that was why s he shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,”\\ncried Mr. Holder. “Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his\\nasking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to\\nsee if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I\\nhave misjudged him!”\\n“When I arrived at th e house,” continued Holmes, “I at once went very\\ncarefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which\\nmight help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and\\nalso that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed\\nalong the tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down and\\nindistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen\\ndoor, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions\\non one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had\\nbeen disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was\\nshown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a\\nlittle, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the\\nmaid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and\\ninquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing\\nanything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I\\ngot into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the\\nsnow in front of me.\\n371\\n“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\\nline which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at\\nonce convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The\\nfirst had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread\\nwas marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he\\nhad passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall\\nwindow, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I\\nwalked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane.\\nI saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though\\nthere had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had\\nfallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the\\nlane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had\\nbeen hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the\\npavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.\\n“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and\\nframework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that\\nsomeone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where\\nthe wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able\\nto form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the\\nwindow; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by\\nyour son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each\\ntugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither\\nalone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a\\nfragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now\\nwas, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?\\n“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,\\nwhatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that\\nit was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece\\nand the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself\\nto be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved\\nhis cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should\\nretain her secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I\\nremembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted\\non seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\\n“And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who\\nelse could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I\\nknew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very\\nlimited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him\\nbefore as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been\\nhe who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he\\nknew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he\\nwas safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own\\nfamily.\\n373\\n“Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went\\nin the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick up an\\nacquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the\\nnight before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by\\nbuying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to\\nStreatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.”\\n“I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” said Mr.\\nHolder.\\n“Precise ly. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and\\nchanged my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I\\nsaw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so\\nastute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and\\nsaw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him\\nevery particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a lifepreserver\\nfrom the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to\\nhis head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I\\ntold him that we would give him a price for the stones he held—1000\\npounds apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown.\\n‘Why, dash it all!’ said he, ‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I\\nsoon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on\\npromising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and\\nafter much chaffering I got our stones at 1000 pounds apiece. Then I looked\\nin upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed\\nabout two o’clock, after what I may call a really hard day’s work.”\\n“A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,” said the\\nbanker, rising. “Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find\\nme ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all\\nthat I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to\\nhim for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor\\nMary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where\\nshe is now.”\\n“I think that we may safely say,” returned Holmes, “that she is wherever Sir\\nGeorge Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are,\\nthey will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.”\\n12.\\nThe Adventure of the Copper Beeches.\\n“To the man who loves art for its own sake,” remarked Sherlock Holmes,\\ntossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, “it is\\nfrequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest\\npleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you\\nhave so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which\\nyou have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say,\\noccasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the\\nmany causes célèbres and sensational trials in which I have figured but\\nrather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but\\nwhich have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical\\nsynthesis which I have made my special province.”\\n375\\n“And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the\\ncharge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.”\\n“You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with\\nthe tongs and lighting with it the long cherrywood pipe which was wont to\\nreplace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative\\nmood—”you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into\\neach of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing\\nupon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the\\nonly notable feature about the thing.”\\n“It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,” I remarked\\nwith some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more\\nthan once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s singular character.\\n“No, it is not selfishness or conceit,” said he, answering, as was his wont,\\nmy thoughts rather than my words. “If I claim full justice for my art, it is\\nbecause it is an impersonal thing— a thing beyond myself. Crime is\\ncommon. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the\\ncrime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a\\ncourse of lectures into a series of tales.”\\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on\\neither side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog\\nrolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing\\nwindows loomed like\\n377\\ndark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and\\nshone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had\\nnot been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning,\\ndipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of\\npapers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged\\nin no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\\n“At the same time,” he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat\\npuffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, “you can hardly be\\nopen to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have\\nbeen so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of\\ncrime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to\\nhelp the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary\\nSutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and\\nthe incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the\\npale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have\\nbordered on the trivial.”\\n“The end may have been so,” I answered, “but the methods\\nI hold to have been novel and of interest.”\\n“Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the publi c, the great un\\nobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his t ooth\\nor a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades\\nof analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot blame\\nyou, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man,\\nhas lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems\\nto be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and\\ngiving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have\\ntouched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my\\nzero-point, I fancy. Read it!” He tossed a crumpled letter\\nacross to me.\\nIt was dated f rom Montague Place upon the preceding\\nevening, and ran thus:\\n“DEAR MR. HOLME S:—I am very anxious to consult\\nyou as to whether I should or should not accept a situati on\\nwhich has been offered to me as governess. I shall call a t halfpast ten tomorrow\\nif I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,\\n“VIOLET HUNTER.”\\n“Do you know the young lady?” I asked.\\n“Not I.”\\n“It is hal f-past ten now.”\\n“Yes, and I have no doub t that is her ring.”\\n“It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You\\nremember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere\\nwhim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this\\ncase, also.”\\n“Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here,\\nunless I am much mistaken, is the person in ques\\n379 tion.”\\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was\\nplainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover’s\\negg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to\\nmake in the world.\\n“You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,” said she, as my companion\\nrose to greet her, “but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no\\nparents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that\\nperhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.”\\n“Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to\\nserve you.”\\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and\\nspeech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and\\nthen composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together,\\nto listen to her story.\\n“I have been a gover ness for five years,” said she, “in the family of Colonel\\nSpence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at\\nHalifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so\\nthat I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered\\nadvertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had\\nsaved began to run short, and I was at my wit’s end as to what I should do.\\n“There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End calle d\\nWestaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see\\nwhether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the\\nname of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss\\nStoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking\\nemployment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when\\nshe consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would\\nsuit them.\\n“Well, wh en I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual,\\nbut I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a\\nvery smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon\\nfold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose,\\nlooking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite\\na jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\\n“‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for any thing better. Capital!\\ncapital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the\\nmost genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was\\nquite a pleasure to look at him.\\n“‘You are looking for a situatio n, miss?’ he asked.\\n“‘Yes, sir.’\\n“‘As gover ness?’\\n“‘Yes, sir.’\\n“‘And wha t salary do you ask?’\\n“‘I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.’\\n381\\n“‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat hands\\nout into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. ‘How could anyone\\noffer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?’\\n“‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,’ said I. ‘A little\\nFrench, a little German, music, and drawing— ’\\n“‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have\\nyou or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a\\nnutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who\\nmay some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if\\nyou have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to\\naccept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam,\\nwould commence at 100 pounds a year.’\\n“You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer\\nseemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps\\nthe look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a\\nnote.\\n“‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until\\nhis eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face,\\n‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they\\nmay meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.’\\n“It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a\\nman. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great\\nconvenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole\\ntransaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite\\ncommitted myself.\\n“‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.\\n“‘Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the\\nfar side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady,\\nand the dearest old country-house.’\\n“‘And my duties, sir? I should be gl ad to know what they would be.’\\n“‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you co uld see\\nhim killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone\\nbefore you could wink!’ He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes\\ninto his head again.\\n“I was a little star tled at the nature of the child’s amusement, but the\\nfather’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\\n“‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take charge of a sing le child?’\\n“‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,’ he cried. ‘Your\\nduty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any\\nlittle commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such\\ncommands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?’\\n“‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’\\n“‘Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know—\\nfaddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear\\n383\\nany dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little\\nwhim. Heh?’\\n“‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.\\n“‘Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offen sive to you?’\\n“‘Oh, no.’\\n“‘Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?’\\n“I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, M r. Holmes, my hair\\nis somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been\\nconsidered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand\\nfashion.\\n“‘I am a fraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I. He had been watching me\\neagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as\\nI spoke.\\n“‘I am a fraid that it is quite essential,’ said he. ‘It is a little fancy of my\\nwife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you know, madam, ladies’ fancies must be\\nconsulted. And so you won’t cut your hair?’\\n“‘No, sir, I really could not,’ I answered firm ly.\\n“‘Ah, very well; then that quite settles the ma tter. It is a pity, because in\\nother respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss\\nStoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.’\\n“The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word\\nto either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon\\nher face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome\\ncommission through my refusal.\\n“‘Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’ she asked.\\n“‘If you please, Miss Stoper.’\\n“‘Well, really, it seems rathe r useless, since you refuse the most excellent\\noffers in this fashion,’ said she sharply. ‘You can hardly expect us to exert\\nourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss\\nHunter.’ She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough\\nin the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table. I began to ask myself\\nwhether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had\\nstrange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters,\\nthey were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses\\nin England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides, what use was my hair to\\nme? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be\\namong the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a\\nmistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my\\npride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was\\nstill open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it\\nhere and I will read it to you: “‘The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\\n“‘DEAR MISS HUNTER:—Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your\\naddress, and I write from here\\n385\\nto ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very\\nanxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my\\ndescription of you. We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter, or 120\\npounds a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which\\nour fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is\\nfond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a\\ndress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of\\npurchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now\\nin Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to\\nsitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need\\ncause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity,\\nespecially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short\\ninterview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only\\nhope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your\\nduties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come,\\nand I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your\\ntrain.\\nYours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.’\\n“That is the letter which I have just rece ived, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is\\nmade up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final\\nstep I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.”\\n“Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the questio n,” said\\nHolmes, smiling.\\n“But you would n ot advise me to refuse?”\\n“I confess that it is not the situation whic h I should like to see a sister of\\nmine apply for.”\\n“What is the mea ning of it all, Mr. Holmes?”\\n“Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps y ou have yourself formed some\\nopinion?”\\n“Well, the re seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle\\nseemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife\\nis a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be\\ntaken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order\\nto prevent an outbreak?”\\n“That is a possible sol ution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the most\\nprobable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a\\nyoung lady.”\\n“But the mon ey, Mr. Holmes, the money!”\\n“Well, yes, of course the pay is good—to o good. That is what makes me\\nuneasy. Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when they could have\\ntheir pick for 40 pounds? There must be some strong reason behind.”\\n“I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would unde rstand\\nafterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that\\nyou were at the back of me.”\\n“Oh, you may carry that feel ing away with you. I assure you that your little\\nproblem promises to be the most interesting\\n387\\nwhich has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly\\nnovel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in\\ndanger—”\\n“Danger! What danger do you foresee?”\\nHolmes shook his head gravely. “It would cease to be a danger if we could\\ndefine it,” said he. “But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring\\nme down to your help.”\\n“That is enough.” She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept\\nfrom her face. “I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I\\nshall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start\\nfor Winchester to-morrow.” With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade\\nus both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\\n“At least,” said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs,\\n“she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.”\\n“And she would need to be,” said Holmes gravely. “I am much mistaken if\\nwe do not hear from her before many days are past.”\\nIt was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight\\nwent by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her\\ndirection and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this\\nlonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions,\\nthe light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or\\na plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite\\nbeyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat\\nfrequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air,\\nbut he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it.\\n“Data! data! data!” he cried impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without clay.”\\nAnd yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should\\never have accepted such a situation.\\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I\\nwas thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those\\nall-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I\\nwould leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him\\nin the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He\\nopened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it\\nacross to me.\\n“Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,” said he, and turned back to his\\nchemical studies.\\nThe summons wa s a brief and urgent one.\\n“Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Wi nchester at midday to-morrow,” it\\nsaid. “Do come! I am at my wit’s end. HUNTER.”\\n“Will you come with me?” asked Holmes, glancing up.\\n“I should wish to.”\\n“Just look it up, the n.”\\n“There is a train at half -past nine,” said I, glancing over my\\n389\\nBradshaw. “It is due at Winchester at 11:30.”\\n“That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better post\\npone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be a t our\\nbest in the morning.”\\nBy eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way\\nto the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the\\nmorning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the\\nHampshire border he threw them down and began to admire\\nthe scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, fleck ed\\nwith little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east.\\nThe sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhila rating nip in\\nthe air, which set an edge to a man’s energy.\\nAll over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around\\nAldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadin gs\\npeeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage. “Ar e they not fresh\\nand beautiful?” I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs\\nof Baker Street. But Holmes shook his head gravely.\\n“Do you know, Watson,” said he, “that it is one of th e curses\\nof a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything\\nwith reference to my own special subject. You look at these\\nscattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I lo ok\\nat them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling\\nof their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may\\nbe committed there.”\\n“Good heavens!” I cr ied. “Who would associate crime with\\nthese dear old homesteads?”\\n“They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief,\\nWatson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest an d vilest alleys in\\nLondon do not present a more dreadful record of\\nsin than does the smiling and beautiful countrysid e.” “You horrify me!”\\n“But the reason is very obvious.The pressure of public opinion can do in the\\ntown what the law cannot accomplish. There\\nis no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the\\nthud of a drunkard’s blow, does not beget sympathy and in dignation among\\nthe neighbours, and then the whole machinery\\nof justice is ever so close that a word of compl aint can set it\\ngoing, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock .\\nBut look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled f or\\nthe most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the\\nlaw. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wicked ness which may\\ngo on, year in, year out, in such places, and\\nnone the wiser. Had this lady who appeals t o us for help gone\\nto live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It\\nis the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is\\nclear that she is not personally threatened.”\\n“No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get\\naway.”\\n“Quite so. She has her freedom.”\\n“What can be the matter, then? C an you suggest no explanation?”\\n391\\n“I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the\\nfacts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be\\ndetermined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting\\nfor us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all\\nthat Miss Hunter has to tell.”\\nThe Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from\\nthe station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had\\nengaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\\n“I am so delighted that you have come,” she said earnestly. “It is so very\\nkind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice\\nwill be altogether invaluable to me.”\\n“Pray tell us what has happened to you.”\\n“I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be\\nback before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he\\nlittle knew for what purpose.”\\n“Let us have everything in its due order.” Holmes thrust his long thin legs\\nout towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\\n“In the first place, I may say that I have met, on th e whole, with no actual\\nill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that.\\nBut I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.”\\n“What can you not understand?”\\n“Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred.\\nWhen I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart\\nto the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not\\nbeautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but\\nall stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds\\nround it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down\\nto the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards\\nfrom the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the\\nwoods all round are part of Lord Southerton’s preserves. A clump of copper\\nbeeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the\\nplace.\\n“I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was\\nintroduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no\\ntruth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in\\nyour rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a\\nsilent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than\\nthirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their\\nconversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years,\\nthat he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the\\ndaughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that\\nthe reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion\\nto her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I\\ncan quite imagine that her posi\\n393 tion must have been uncomfo rtable with her father’s young wife.\\n“Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature.\\nShe impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity.\\nIt was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband\\nand to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to\\nthe other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind\\nto her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to\\nbe a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She\\nwould often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face.\\nMore than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that\\nit was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have\\nnever met so utterly spoiled and so illnatured a little creature. He is small\\nfor his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole\\nlife appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and\\ngloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than\\nhimself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite\\nremarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects.\\nBut I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he\\nhas little to do with my story.”\\n“I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they seem to you\\nto be relevant or not.”\\n“I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing\\nabout the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct\\nof the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is\\nhis name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a\\nperpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been\\nquite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is\\na very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle\\nand much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I\\nspend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to\\neach other in one corner of the building.\\n“For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very\\nquiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and\\nwhispered something to her husband.\\n“‘Oh, yes,’ said he, turning to me, ‘we are very much obliged to you, Miss\\nHunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you\\nthat it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall\\nnow see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid\\nout upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on\\nwe should both be extremely obliged.’\\n“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It\\nwas of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of\\nhaving been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been\\nmeasured for it. Both\\n395\\nMr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed\\nquite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the\\ndrawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front\\nof the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair\\nhad been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it.\\nIn this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on\\nthe other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories\\nthat I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I\\nlaughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently\\nno sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her\\nlap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle\\nsuddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and\\nthat I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\\n“Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly\\nsimilar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window,\\nand again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer\\nhad an immense répertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed\\nme a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my\\nown shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to\\nhim. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and\\nthen suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to\\nchange my dress. “You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I\\nbecame as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could\\npossibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face\\naway from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see\\nwhat was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but\\nI soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy\\nthought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief.\\nOn the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up\\nto my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was\\nbehind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least\\nthat was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived\\nthat there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded\\nman in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is\\nan important highway, and there are usually people there. This man,\\nhowever, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was\\nlooking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs.\\nRucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She\\nsaid nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in\\nmy hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.\\n“‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who\\nstares up at Miss Hunter.’\\n“‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.\\n397 “‘No, I know no one in these parts.’\\n“‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to\\ngo away.’\\n“‘Surely i t would be better to take no notice.’\\n“‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and\\nwave him away like that.’\\n“I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the\\nblind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the\\nwindow, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.”\\n“Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative promises to be a most\\ninteresting one.”\\n“You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little\\nrelation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first\\nday that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small\\nouthouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard\\nthe sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving\\nabout.\\n“‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks.\\n‘Is he not a beauty?’\\n“I looked through an d was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague\\nfigure huddled up in the darkness.\\n“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my em ployer, laughing at the start which I had\\ngiven. ‘It’s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my\\ngroom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a\\nday, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller\\nlets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his\\nfangs upon. For goodness’ sake don’t you ever on any pretext set your foot\\nover the threshold at night, for it’s as much as your life is worth.’\\n“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of\\nmy bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a beautiful\\nmoonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and\\nalmost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the\\nscene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of\\nthe copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It\\nwas a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black\\nmuzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and\\nvanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a\\nchill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\\n“And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you k now,\\ncut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom\\nof my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse\\nmyself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own\\nlittle things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper\\nones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled\\n399\\nthe first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was\\nnaturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that\\nit might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of\\nkeys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew\\nthe drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you\\nwould never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.\\n“I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same\\nthickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me.\\nHow could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I\\nundid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own\\nhair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were\\nidentical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing\\nat all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said\\nnothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the\\nwrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.\\n“I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I\\nsoon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one\\nwing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which\\nfaced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite,\\nbut it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I\\nmet Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a\\nlook on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial\\nman to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all\\ncrinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He\\nlocked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.\\n“This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds\\nwith my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the\\nwindows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three\\nof which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were\\nevidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them\\noccasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as\\never.\\n“‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word,\\nmy dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.’\\n“I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I, ‘you seem to\\nhave quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters\\nup.’\\n“He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.\\n“‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I have made my dark room\\nup there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.\\nWho would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?’ He spoke\\nin a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read\\nsuspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\\n401\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\\nsomething about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on\\nfire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of\\nthat. It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good might come\\nfrom my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s instinct; perhaps it\\nwas woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,\\nand I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\\n“It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr.\\nRucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted\\nrooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him\\nthrough the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday\\nevening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in\\nthe door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs.\\nRucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had\\nan admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the\\ndoor, and slipped through.\\n“There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which\\nturned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors\\nin a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an\\nempty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in\\nthe other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through\\nthem. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been\\nfastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring\\nin the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was\\nlocked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door\\ncorresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see\\nby the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness.\\nEvidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in\\nthe passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might\\nveil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow\\npass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone\\nout from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the\\nsight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned\\nand ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at\\nthe skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and\\nstraight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\\n“‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I\\nsaw the door open.’\\n“‘Oh, I am so fright ened!’ I panted.\\n“‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you cannot think how\\ncaressing and soothing his manner was—’and what has frightened you, my\\ndear young lady?’\\n“But his voice wa s just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on\\nmy guard against him.\\n“‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I an\\n403\\nswered. ‘But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened\\nand ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’\\n“‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.\\n“‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.\\n“‘Why do you think that I lock this do or?’\\n“‘I am sure that I do not know.’\\n“‘It is to keep people out who h ave no business there. Do\\nyou see?’ He was still smiling in the most amiable manner. “‘I am sure if I\\nhad known—’\\n“‘Well, then, y ou know now. And if you ever put your foot\\nover that threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin\\nof rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—’I’ll throw\\nyou to the mastiff.’\\n“I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have\\nrushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself\\nlying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I\\ncould not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the\\nhouse, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They\\nwere all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well.\\nOf course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as\\nstrong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I\\nput on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile\\nfrom the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible\\ndoubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be\\nloose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of\\ninsensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the\\nhousehold who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would\\nventure to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in\\nmy joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to\\ncome into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock,\\nfor Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the\\nevening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my\\nadventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what\\nit all means, and, above all, what I should do.”\\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend\\nrose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an\\nexpression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\\n“Is Toller still drunk?” he asked.\\n“Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with\\nhim.”\\n“That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Is the re a cellar with a good strong lock?”\\n“Yes, the wine-cellar.”\\n“You seem to me to ha ve acted all through this matter like a very brave and\\nsensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that\\n405 you could perform one more f eat? I should not ask it of you if\\nI did not think you a quite exceptional woman.”\\n“I will try. What is it?”\\n“We shall be at the Cop per Beeches by seven o’clock, my\\nfriend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we\\nhope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the\\nalarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn\\nthe key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.”\\n“I will do it.”\\n“Excellent! W e shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is\\nonly one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate\\nsomeone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is\\nobvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter,\\nMiss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to\\nAmerica. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure,\\nand the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some\\nillness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be\\nsacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in\\nthe road was undoubtedly some friend of hers—possibly her fiancé—and\\nno doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress and were so like her, he was\\nconvinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from\\nyour gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer\\ndesired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from\\nendeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most\\nserious point in the case is the disposition of the child.”\\n“What on earth has that to do with it?” I ejaculated.\\n“My dear Watson, you as a medical man are contin ually gaining light as to\\nthe tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see that the\\nconverse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into\\nthe character of parents by studying their children. This child’s disposition\\nis abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s sake, and whether he derives this\\nfrom his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes\\nevil for the poor girl who is in their power.”\\n“I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes, ” cried our client. “A thousand\\nthings come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let\\nus lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.”\\n“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cu nning man. We\\ncan do nothing until seven o’clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it\\nwill not be long before we solve the mystery.”\\nWe were as good as our word, for it was jus t seven when we reached the\\nCopper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The\\ngroup of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the\\nlight of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss\\nHunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\\n407 “Have you managed it?” aske d Holmes.\\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. “That is Mrs.\\nToller in the cellar,” said she. “Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug.\\nHere are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle’s.”\\n“You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes with enthusiasm. “Now lead\\nthe way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.”\\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and\\nfound ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described.\\nHolmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the\\nvarious keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within,\\nand at the silence Holmes’ face clouded over.\\n“I trust that we are not too late,” said he. “I think, Miss Hunter, that we had\\nbetter go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall\\nsee whether we cannot make our way in.”\\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.\\nTogether we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture\\nsave a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight\\nabove was open, and the prisoner gone.\\n“There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes; “this beauty has guessed\\nMiss Hunter’s intentions and has carried his victim off.”\\n“But how?”\\n“Through th e skylight. We shall soon see how he managed\\nit.” He swung himself up onto the roof. “Ah, yes,” he cried, “here’s the end\\nof a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.”\\n“But it is impossible,” said Miss Hunter; “the ladder was not there when the\\nRucastles went away.”\\n“He has come back an d done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous\\nman. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear\\nnow upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have\\nyour pistol ready.”\\nThe words were ha rdly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door\\nof the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss\\nHunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but\\nSherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\\n“You villain!” said he, “where’s your daughter?”\\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at th e open skylight.\\n“It is for me to ask you that,” he shrieked, “you thieves! Spies and thieves! I\\nhave caught you, have I? You are in my power. I’ll serve you!” He turned\\nand clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\\n“He’s gone for the dog!” cried Miss Hunter.\\n“I have my revolver,” said I.\\n409\\n“Better close the front door,” cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the\\nstairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of\\na hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which\\nit was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking\\nlimbs came staggering out at a side door.\\n“My God!” he cried. “Someone has loosed the dog. It’s not been fed for two\\ndays. Quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!”\\nHolmes and I rushed out and round t he angle of the house, with Toller\\nhurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle\\nburied in Rucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground.\\nRunning up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth\\nstill meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we\\nseparated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house.\\nWe laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the\\nsobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his\\npain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall,\\ngaunt woman entered the room.\\n“Mrs. Toller!” cried Miss Hunte r.\\n“Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me o ut when he came back before he went up\\nto you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were\\nplanning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”\\n“Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is clear that Mrs. To ller knows\\nmore about this matter than anyone else.”\\n“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to t ell what I know.”\\n“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are s everal points on\\nwhich I must confess that I am still in the dark.”\\n“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “a nd I’d have done so before\\nnow if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If there’s police-court business\\nover this, you’ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and\\nthat I was Miss Alice’s friend too.\\n“She was never happy at home, M iss Alice wasn’t, from the time that her\\nfather married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but\\nit never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a\\nfriend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by\\nwill, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word\\nabout them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle’s hands. He knew he was\\nsafe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward,\\nwho would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought\\nit time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she\\nmarried or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept\\non worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s\\ndoor. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her\\nbeautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young man, and\\nhe stuck to her as true as man could be.”\\n411\\n“Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good enough to tell us\\nmakes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr.\\nRucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?”\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n“And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the\\ndisagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.”\\n“That was it, sir.”\\n“But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,\\nblockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,\\nmetallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same\\nas his.”\\n“Mr. Fo wler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said Mrs.\\nToller serenely.\\n“And in this wa y he managed that your good man should have no want of\\ndrink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master\\nhad gone out.”\\n“You have it, s ir, just as it happened.”\\n“I am sure we owe you an apology, M rs.Toller,” said Holmes, “for you have\\ncertainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the\\ncountry surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best\\nescort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus\\nstandi now is rather a questionable one.”\\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of t he sinister house with the copper\\nbeeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a\\nbroken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They\\nstill live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle’s\\npast life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss\\nRucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after\\ntheir flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the\\nisland of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to\\nmy disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had\\nceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a\\nprivate school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable\\nsuccess.\\n'"

              "'PROLOGUE\\nIT was 2 p.m. on the afternoon of May 7, 1915. The Lusitania had\\nbeen struck by two torpedoes in succession and was sinking\\nrapidly, while the boats were being launched with all possible\\nspeed. The women and children were being lined up awaiting their\\nturn. Some still clung desperately to husbands and fathers;\\nothers clutched their children closely to their breasts. One girl\\nstood alone, slightly apart from the rest. She was quite young,\\nnot more than eighteen. She did not seem afraid, and her grave,\\nsteadfast eyes looked straight ahead.\\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\\nA man\\'s voice beside her made her start and turn. She had\\nnoticed the speaker more than once amongst the first-class\\npassengers. There had been a hint of mystery about him which had\\nappealed to her imagination. He spoke to no one. If anyone spoke\\nto him he was quick to rebuff the overture. Also he had a nervous\\nway of looking over his shoulder with a swift, suspicious glance.\\nShe noticed now that he was greatly agitated. There were beads\\nof perspiration on his brow. He was evidently in a state of\\novermastering fear. And yet he did not strike her as the kind of\\nman who would be afraid to meet death!\\n\"Yes?\" Her grave eyes met his inquiringly.\\nHe stood looking at her with a kind of desperate irresolution.\\n\"It must be!\" he muttered to himself. \"Yes--it is the only way.\"\\nThen aloud he said abruptly: \"You are an American?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"A patriotic one?\"\\nThe girl flushed.\\n\"I guess you\\'ve no right to ask such a thing! Of course I am!\"\\n\"Don\\'t be offended. You wouldn\\'t be if you knew how much there\\nwas at stake. But I\\'ve got to trust some one--and it must be a\\nwoman.\"\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Because of \\'women and children first.\\' \" He looked round and\\nlowered his voice. \"I\\'m carrying papers--vitally important\\npapers. They may make all the difference to the Allies in the\\nwar. You understand? These papers have GOT to be saved! They\\'ve\\nmore chance with you than with me. Will you take them?\"\\nThe girl held out her hand.\\n\"Wait--I must warn you. There may be a risk--if I\\'ve been\\nfollowed. I don\\'t think I have, but one never knows. If so,\\nthere will be danger. Have you the nerve to go through with it?\"\\nThe girl smiled.\\n\"I\\'ll go through with it all right. And I\\'m real proud to be\\nchosen! What am I to do with them afterwards?\"\\n\"Watch the newspapers! I\\'ll advertise in the personal column of\\nthe Times, beginning \\'Shipmate.\\' At the end of three days if\\nthere\\'s nothing--well, you\\'ll know I\\'m down and out. Then take\\nthe packet to the American Embassy, and deliver it into the\\nAmbassador\\'s own hands. Is that clear?\"\\n\"Quite clear.\"\\n\"Then be ready--I\\'m going to say good-bye.\" He took her hand in\\nhis. \"Good-bye. Good luck to you,\" he said in a louder tone.\\nHer hand closed on the oilskin packet that had lain in his palm.\\nThe Lusitania settled with a more decided list to starboard. In\\nanswer to a quick command, the girl went forward to take her\\nplace in the boat.\\nCHAPTER I\\nTHE YOUNG ADVENTURERS, LTD.\\n\"TOMMY, old thing!\"\\n\"Tuppence, old bean!\"\\nThe two young people greeted each other affectionately, and\\nmomentarily blocked the Dover Street Tube exit in doing so. The\\nadjective \"old\" was misleading. Their united ages would\\ncertainly not have totalled forty-five.\\n\"Not seen you for simply centuries,\" continued the young man.\\n\"Where are you off to? Come and chew a bun with me. We\\'re\\ngetting a bit unpopular here--blocking the gangway as it were.\\nLet\\'s get out of it.\"\\nThe girl assenting, they started walking down Dover Street\\ntowards Piccadilly.\\n\"Now then,\" said Tommy, \"where shall we go?\"\\nThe very faint anxiety which underlay his tone did not escape the\\nastute ears of Miss Prudence Cowley, known to her intimate\\nfriends for some mysterious reason as \"Tuppence.\" She pounced at\\nonce.\\n\"Tommy, you\\'re stony!\"\\n\"Not a bit of it,\" declared Tommy unconvincingly. \"Rolling in\\ncash.\"\\n\"You always were a shocking liar,\" said Tuppence severely,\\n\"though you did once persuade Sister Greenbank that the doctor\\nhad ordered you beer as a tonic, but forgotten to write it on the\\nchart. Do you remember?\"\\nTommy chuckled.\\n\"I should think I did! Wasn\\'t the old cat in a rage when she\\nfound out? Not that she was a bad sort really, old Mother\\nGreenbank! Good old hospital--demobbed like everything else, I\\nsuppose?\"\\nTuppence sighed.\\n\"Yes. You too?\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"Two months ago.\"\\n\"Gratuity?\" hinted Tuppence.\\n\"Spent.\"\\n\"Oh, Tommy!\"\\n\"No, old thing, not in riotous dissipation. No such luck! The\\ncost of living--ordinary plain, or garden living nowadays is, I\\nassure you, if you do not know----\"\\n\"My dear child,\" interrupted Tuppence, \"there is nothing I do NOT\\nknow about the cost of living. Here we are at Lyons\\', and we\\nwill each of us pay for our own. That\\'s it!\" And Tuppence led\\nthe way upstairs.\\nThe place was full, and they wandered about looking for a table,\\ncatching odds and ends of conversation as they did so.\\n\"And--do you know, she sat down and CRIED when I told her she\\ncouldn\\'t have the flat after all.\" \"It was simply a BARGAIN, my\\ndear! Just like the one Mabel Lewis brought from Paris----\"\\n\"Funny scraps one does overhear,\" murmured Tommy. \"I passed two\\nJohnnies in the street to-day talking about some one called Jane\\nFinn. Did you ever hear such a name?\"\\nBut at that moment two elderly ladies rose and collected parcels,\\nand Tuppence deftly ensconced herself in one of the vacant seats.\\nTommy ordered tea and buns. Tuppence ordered tea and buttered\\ntoast.\\n\"And mind the tea comes in separate teapots,\" she added severely.\\nTommy sat down opposite her. His bared head revealed a shock of\\nexquisitely slicked-back red hair. His face was pleasantly\\nugly--nondescript, yet unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a\\nsportsman. His brown suit was well cut, but perilously near the\\nend of its tether.\\nThey were an essentially modern-looking couple as they sat there.\\nTuppence had no claim to beauty, but there was character and\\ncharm in the elfin lines of her little face, with its determined\\nchin and large, wide-apart grey eyes that looked mistily out from\\nunder straight, black brows. She wore a small bright green toque\\nover her black bobbed hair, and her extremely short and rather\\nshabby skirt revealed a pair of uncommonly dainty ankles. Her\\nappearance presented a valiant attempt at smartness.\\nThe tea came at last, and Tuppence, rousing herself from a fit of\\nmeditation, poured it out.\\n\"Now then,\" said Tommy, taking a large bite of bun, \"let\\'s get\\nup-to-date. Remember, I haven\\'t seen you since that time in\\nhospital in 1916.\"\\n\"Very well.\" Tuppence helped herself liberally to buttered\\ntoast. \"Abridged biography of Miss Prudence Cowley, fifth\\ndaughter of Archdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell, Suffolk.\\nMiss Cowley left the delights (and drudgeries) of her home life\\nearly in the war and came up to London, where she entered an\\nofficers\\' hospital. First month: Washed up six hundred and\\nforty-eight plates every day. Second month: Promoted to drying\\naforesaid plates. Third month: Promoted to peeling potatoes.\\nFourth month: Promoted to cutting bread and butter. Fifth month:\\nPromoted one floor up to duties of wardmaid with mop and pail.\\nSixth month: Promoted to waiting at table. Seventh month:\\nPleasing appearance and nice manners so striking that am promoted\\nto waiting on the Sisters! Eighth month: Slight check in career.\\nSister Bond ate Sister Westhaven\\'s egg! Grand row! Wardmaid\\nclearly to blame! Inattention in such important matters cannot\\nbe too highly censured. Mop and pail again! How are the mighty\\nfallen! Ninth month: Promoted to sweeping out wards, where I\\nfound a friend of my childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford\\n(bow, Tommy!), whom I had not seen for five long years. The\\nmeeting was affecting! Tenth month: Reproved by matron for\\nvisiting the pictures in company with one of the patients,\\nnamely: the aforementioned Lieutenant Thomas Beresford.\\nEleventh and twelfth months: Parlourmaid duties resumed with\\nentire success. At the end of the year left hospital in a blaze\\nof glory. After that, the talented Miss Cowley drove\\nsuccessively a trade delivery van, a motor-lorry and a general!\"\\nThe last was the pleasantest. He was quite a young general!\"\\n\"What brighter was that?\" inquired Tommy. \"Perfectly sickening\\nthe way those brass hats drove from the War Office to the Savoy,\\nand from the Savoy to the War Office!\"\\n\"I\\'ve forgotten his name now,\" confessed Tuppence. \"To resume,\\nthat was in a way the apex of my career. I next entered a\\nGovernment office. We had several very enjoyable tea parties. I\\nhad intended to become a land girl, a postwoman, and a bus\\nconductress by way of rounding off my career--but the Armistice\\nintervened! I clung to the office with the true limpet touch for\\nmany long months, but, alas, I was combed out at last. Since then\\nI\\'ve been looking for a job. Now then--your turn.\"\\n\"There\\'s not so much promotion in mine,\" said Tommy regretfully,\\n\"and a great deal less variety. I went out to France again, as\\nyou know. Then they sent me to Mesopotamia, and I got wounded\\nfor the second time, and went into hospital out there. Then I got\\nstuck in Egypt till the Armistice happened, kicked my heels there\\nsome time longer, and, as I told you, finally got demobbed. And,\\nfor ten long, weary months I\\'ve been job hunting! There aren\\'t\\nany jobs! And, if there were, they wouldn\\'t give \\'em to me. What\\ngood am I? What do I know about business? Nothing.\"\\nTuppence nodded gloomily.\\n\"What about the colonies?\" she suggested.\\nTommy shook his head.\\n\"I shouldn\\'t like the colonies--and I\\'m perfectly certain they\\nwouldn\\'t like me!\"\\n\"Rich relations?\"\\nAgain Tommy shook his head.\\n\"Oh, Tommy, not even a great-aunt?\"\\n\"I\\'ve got an old uncle who\\'s more or less rolling, but he\\'s no\\ngood.\"\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\"Wanted to adopt me once. I refused.\"\\n\"I think I remember hearing about it,\" said Tuppence slowly. \"You\\nrefused because of your mother----\"\\nTommy flushed.\\n\"Yes, it would have been a bit rough on the mater. As you know,\\nI was all she had. Old boy hated her--wanted to get me away from\\nher. Just a bit of spite.\"\\n\"Your mother\\'s dead, isn\\'t she?\" said Tuppence gently.\\nTommy nodded.\\nTuppence\\'s large grey eyes looked misty.\\n\"You\\'re a good sort, Tommy. I always knew it.\"\\n\"Rot!\" said Tommy hastily. \"Well, that\\'s my position. I\\'m just\\nabout desperate.\"\\n\"So am I! I\\'ve hung out as long as I could. I\\'ve touted round.\\nI\\'ve answered advertisements. I\\'ve tried every mortal blessed\\nthing. I\\'ve screwed and saved and pinched! But it\\'s no good. I\\nshall have to go home!\"\\n\"Don\\'t you want to?\"\\n\"Of course I don\\'t want to! What\\'s the good of being\\nsentimental? Father\\'s a dear--I\\'m awfully fond of him--but you\\'ve\\nno idea how I worry him! He has that delightful early Victorian\\nview that short skirts and smoking are immoral. You can imagine\\nwhat a thorn in the flesh I am to him! He just heaved a sigh of\\nrelief when the war took me off. You see, there are seven of us\\nat home. It\\'s awful! All housework and mothers\\' meetings! I\\nhave always been the changeling. I don\\'t want to go back,\\nbut--oh, Tommy, what else is there to do?\"\\nTommy shook his head sadly. There was a silence, and then\\nTuppence burst out:\\n\"Money, money, money! I think about money morning, noon and\\nnight! I dare say it\\'s mercenary of me, but there it is!\"\\n\"Same here,\" agreed Tommy with feeling.\\n\"I\\'ve thought over every imaginable way of getting it too,\"\\ncontinued Tuppence. \"There are only three! To be left it, to\\nmarry it, or to make it. First is ruled out. I haven\\'t got any\\nrich elderly relatives. Any relatives I have are in homes for\\ndecayed gentlewomen! I always help old ladies over crossings,\\nand pick up parcels for old gentlemen, in case they should turn\\nout to be eccentric millionaires. But not one of them has ever\\nasked me my name--and quite a lot never said \\'Thank you.\\' \"\\nThere was a pause.\\n\"Of course,\" resumed Tuppence, \"marriage is my best chance. I\\nmade up my mind to marry money when I was quite young. Any\\nthinking girl would! I\\'m not sentimental, you know.\" She paused.\\n\"Come now, you can\\'t say I\\'m sentimental,\" she added sharply.\\n\"Certainly not,\" agreed Tommy hastily. \"No one would ever think\\nof sentiment in connection with you.\"\\n\"That\\'s not very polite,\" replied Tuppence. \"But I dare say you\\nmean it all right. Well, there it is! I\\'m ready and willing--but\\nI never meet any rich men! All the boys I know are about as hard\\nup as I am.\"\\n\"What about the general?\" inquired Tommy.\\n\"I fancy he keeps a bicycle shop in time of peace,\" explained\\nTuppence. \"No, there it is! Now you could marry a rich girl.\"\\n\"I\\'m like you. I don\\'t know any.\"\\n\"That doesn\\'t matter. You can always get to know one. Now, if I\\nsee a man in a fur coat come out of the Ritz I can\\'t rush up to\\nhim and say: \\'Look here, you\\'re rich. I\\'d like to know you.\\' \"\\n\"Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed\\nfemale?\"\\n\"Don\\'t be silly. You tread on her foot, or pick up her\\nhandkerchief, or something like that. If she thinks you want to\\nknow her she\\'s flattered, and will manage it for you somehow.\"\\n\"You overrate my manly charms,\" murmured Tommy.\\n\"On the other hand,\" proceeded Tuppence, \"my millionaire would\\nprobably run for his life! No--marriage is fraught with\\ndifficulties. Remains--to MAKE money!\"\\n\"We\\'ve tried that, and failed,\" Tommy reminded her.\\n\"We\\'ve tried all the orthodox ways, yes. But suppose we try the\\nunorthodox. Tommy, let\\'s be adventurers!\"\\n\"Certainly,\" replied Tommy cheerfully. \"How do we begin?\"\\n\"That\\'s the difficulty. If we could make ourselves known, people\\nmight hire us to commit crimes for them.\"\\n\"Delightful,\" commented Tommy. \"Especially coming from a\\nclergyman\\'s daughter!\"\\n\"The moral guilt,\" Tuppence pointed out, \"would be theirs--not\\nmine. You must admit that there\\'s a difference between stealing a\\ndiamond necklace for yourself and being hired to steal it.\"\\n\"There wouldn\\'t be the least difference if you were caught!\"\\n\"Perhaps not. But I shouldn\\'t be caught. I\\'m so clever.\"\\n\"Modesty always was your besetting sin,\" remarked Tommy.\\n\"Don\\'t rag. Look here, Tommy, shall we really? Shall we form a\\nbusiness partnership?\"\\n\"Form a company for the stealing of diamond necklaces?\"\\n\"That was only an illustration. Let\\'s have a--what do you call\\nit in book-keeping?\"\\n\"Don\\'t know. Never did any.\"\\n\"I have--but I always got mixed up, and used to put credit\\nentries on the debit side, and vice versa--so they fired me out.\\nOh, I know--a joint venture! It struck me as such a romantic\\nphrase to come across in the middle of musty old figures. It\\'s\\ngot an Elizabethan flavour about it--makes one think of galleons\\nand doubloons. A joint venture!\"\\n\"Trading under the name of the Young Adventurers, Ltd.? Is that\\nyour idea, Tuppence?\"\\n\"It\\'s all very well to laugh, but I feel there might be something\\nin it.\"\\n\"How do you propose to get in touch with your would-be\\nemployers?\"\\n\"Advertisement,\" replied Tuppence promptly. \"Have you got a bit\\nof paper and a pencil? Men usually seem to have. Just like we\\nhave hairpins and powder-puffs.\"\\nTommy handed over a rather shabby green notebook, and Tuppence\\nbegan writing busily.\\n\"Shall we begin: \\'Young officer, twice wounded in the war--\\' \"\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\n\"Oh, very well, my dear boy. But I can assure you that that sort\\nof thing might touch the heart of an elderly spinster, and she\\nmight adopt you, and then there would be no need for you to be a\\nyoung adventurer at all.\"\\n\"I don\\'t want to be adopted.\"\\n\"I forgot you had a prejudice against it. I was only ragging\\nyou! The papers are full up to the brim with that type of thing.\\nNow listen--how\\'s this? \\'Two young adventurers for hire. Willing\\nto do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good.\\' (We might as\\nwell make that clear from the start.) Then we might add: \\'No\\nreasonable offer refused\\'--like flats and furniture.\"\\n\"I should think any offer we get in answer to that would be a\\npretty UNreasonable one!\"\\n\"Tommy! You\\'re a genius! That\\'s ever so much more chic. \\'No\\nunreasonable offer refused--if pay is good.\\' How\\'s that?\"\\n\"I shouldn\\'t mention pay again. It looks rather eager.\"\\n\"It couldn\\'t look as eager as I feel! But perhaps you are right.\\nNow I\\'ll read it straight through. \\'Two young adventurers for\\nhire. Willing to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. No\\nunreasonable offer refused.\\' How would that strike you if you\\nread it?\"\\n\"It would strike me as either being a hoax, or else written by a\\nlunatic.\"\\n\"It\\'s not half so insane as a thing I read this morning beginning\\n\\'Petunia\\' and signed \\'Best Boy.\\' \" She tore out the leaf and\\nhanded it to Tommy. \"There you are. Times, I think. Reply to\\nBox so-and-so. I expect it will be about five shillings. Here\\'s\\nhalf a crown for my share.\"\\nTommy was holding the paper thoughtfully. His faced burned a\\ndeeper red.\\n\"Shall we really try it?\" he said at last. \"Shall we, Tuppence?\\nJust for the fun of the thing?\"\\n\"Tommy, you\\'re a sport! I knew you would be! Let\\'s drink to\\nsuccess.\" She poured some cold dregs of tea into the two cups.\\n\"Here\\'s to our joint venture, and may it prosper!\"\\n\"The Young Adventurers, Ltd.!\" responded Tommy.\\nThey put down the cups and laughed rather uncertainly. Tuppence\\nrose.\\n\"I must return to my palatial suite at the hostel.\"\\n\"Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the Ritz,\" agreed Tommy\\nwith a grin. \"Where shall we meet? And when?\"\\n\"Twelve o\\'clock to-morrow. Piccadilly Tube station. Will that\\nsuit you?\"\\n\"My time is my own,\" replied Mr. Beresford magnificently.\\n\"So long, then.\"\\n\"Good-bye, old thing.\"\\nThe two young people went off in opposite directions. Tuppence\\'s\\nhostel was situated in what was charitably called Southern\\nBelgravia. For reasons of economy she did not take a bus.\\nShe was half-way across St. James\\'s Park, when a man\\'s voice\\nbehind her made her start.\\n\"Excuse me,\" it said. \"But may I speak to you for a moment?\"\\nCHAPTER II\\nMR. WHITTINGTON\\'S OFFER\\nTUPPENCE turned sharply, but the words hovering on the tip of her\\ntongue remained unspoken, for the man\\'s appearance and manner did\\nnot bear out her first and most natural assumption. She\\nhesitated. As if he read her thoughts, the man said quickly:\\n\"I can assure you I mean no disrespect.\"\\nTuppence believed him. Although she disliked and distrusted him\\ninstinctively, she was inclined to acquit him of the particular\\nmotive which she had at first attributed to him. She looked him\\nup and down. He was a big man, clean shaven, with a heavy jowl.\\nHis eyes were small and cunning, and shifted their glance under\\nher direct gaze.\\n\"Well, what is it?\" she asked.\\nThe man smiled.\\n\"I happened to overhear part of your conversation with the young\\ngentleman in Lyons\\'.\"\\n\"Well--what of it?\"\\n\"Nothing--except that I think I may be of some use to you.\"\\nAnother inference forced itself into Tuppence\\'s mind:\\n\"You followed me here?\"\\n\"I took that liberty.\"\\n\"And in what way do you think you could be of use to me?\"\\nThe man took a card from his pocket and handed it to her with a\\nbow.\\nTuppence took it and scrutinized it carefully. It bore the\\ninscription, \"Mr. Edward Whittington.\" Below the name were the\\nwords \"Esthonia Glassware Co.,\" and the address of a city office.\\nMr. Whittington spoke again:\\n\"If you will call upon me to-morrow morning at eleven o\\'clock, I\\nwill lay the details of my proposition before you.\"\\n\"At eleven o\\'clock?\" said Tuppence doubtfully.\\n\"At eleven o\\'clock.\"\\nTuppence made up her mind.\\n\"Very well. I\\'ll be there.\"\\n\"Thank you. Good evening.\"\\nHe raised his hat with a flourish, and walked away. Tuppence\\nremained for some minutes gazing after him. Then she gave a\\ncurious movement of her shoulders, rather as a terrier shakes\\nhimself.\\n\"The adventures have begun,\" she murmured to herself. \"What does\\nhe want me to do, I wonder? There\\'s something about you, Mr.\\nWhittington, that I don\\'t like at all. But, on the other hand,\\nI\\'m not the least bit afraid of you. And as I\\'ve said before, and\\nshall doubtless say again, little Tuppence can look after\\nherself, thank you!\"\\nAnd with a short, sharp nod of her head she walked briskly\\nonward. As a result of further meditations, however, she turned\\naside from the direct route and entered a post office. There she\\npondered for some moments, a telegraph form in her hand. The\\nthought of a possible five shillings spent unnecessarily spurred\\nher to action, and she decided to risk the waste of ninepence.\\nDisdaining the spiky pen and thick, black treacle which a\\nbeneficent Government had provided, Tuppence drew out Tommy\\'s\\npencil which she had retained and wrote rapidly: \"Don\\'t put in\\nadvertisement. Will explain to-morrow.\" She addressed it to Tommy\\nat his club, from which in one short month he would have to\\nresign, unless a kindly fortune permitted him to renew his\\nsubscription.\\n\"It may catch him,\" she murmured. \"Anyway, it\\'s worth trying.\"\\nAfter handing it over the counter she set out briskly for home,\\nstopping at a baker\\'s to buy three penny-worth of new buns.\\nLater, in her tiny cubicle at the top of the house she munched\\nbuns and reflected on the future. What was the Esthonia\\nGlassware Co., and what earthly need could it have for her\\nservices? A pleasurable thrill of excitement made Tuppence\\ntingle. At any rate, the country vicarage had retreated into the\\nbackground again. The morrow held possibilities.\\nIt was a long time before Tuppence went to sleep that night, and,\\nwhen at length she did, she dreamed that Mr. Whittington had set\\nher to washing up a pile of Esthonia Glassware, which bore an\\nunaccountable resemblance to hospital plates!\\nIt wanted some five minutes to eleven when Tuppence reached the\\nblock of buildings in which the offices of the Esthonia Glassware\\nCo. were situated. To arrive before the time would look\\nover-eager. So Tuppence decided to walk to the end of the street\\nand back again. She did so. On the stroke of eleven she plunged\\ninto the recesses of the building. The Esthonia Glassware Co.\\nwas on the top floor. There was a lift, but Tuppence chose to\\nwalk up.\\nSlightly out of breath, she came to a halt outside the ground\\nglass door with the legend painted across it \"Esthonia Glassware\\nCo.\"\\nTuppence knocked. In response to a voice from within, she turned\\nthe handle and walked into a small rather dirty outer office.\\nA middle-aged clerk got down from a high stool at a desk near the\\nwindow and came towards her inquiringly.\\n\"I have an appointment with Mr. Whittington,\" said Tuppence.\\n\"Will you come this way, please.\" He crossed to a partition door\\nwith \"Private\" on it, knocked, then opened the door and stood\\naside to let her pass in.\\nMr. Whittington was seated behind a large desk covered with\\npapers. Tuppence felt her previous judgment confirmed. There was\\nsomething wrong about Mr. Whittington. The combination of his\\nsleek prosperity and his shifty eye was not attractive.\\nHe looked up and nodded.\\n\"So you\\'ve turned up all right? That\\'s good. Sit down, will\\nyou?\"\\nTuppence sat down on the chair facing him. She looked\\nparticularly small and demure this morning. She sat there meekly\\nwith downcast eyes whilst Mr. Whittington sorted and rustled\\namongst his papers. Finally he pushed them away, and leaned over\\nthe desk.\\n\"Now, my dear young lady, let us come to business.\" His large\\nface broadened into a smile. \"You want work? Well, I have work\\nto offer you. What should you say now to L100 down, and all\\nexpenses paid?\" Mr. Whittington leaned back in his chair, and\\nthrust his thumbs into the arm-holes of his waistcoat.\\nTuppence eyed him warily.\\n\"And the nature of the work?\" she demanded.\\n\"Nominal--purely nominal. A pleasant trip, that is all.\"\\n\"Where to?\"\\nMr. Whittington smiled again.\\n\"Paris.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. To herself she said: \"Of\\ncourse, if father heard that he would have a fit! But somehow I\\ndon\\'t see Mr. Whittington in the role of the gay deceiver.\"\\n\"Yes,\" continued Whittington. \"What could be more delightful? To\\nput the clock back a few years--a very few, I am sure--and\\nre-enter one of those charming pensionnats de jeunes filles with\\nwhich Paris abounds----\"\\nTuppence interrupted him.\\n\"A pensionnat?\"\\n\"Exactly. Madame Colombier\\'s in the Avenue de Neuilly.\"\\nTuppence knew the name well. Nothing could have been more\\nselect. She had had several American friends there. She was more\\nthan ever puzzled.\\n\"You want me to go to Madame Colombier\\'s? For how long?\"\\n\"That depends. Possibly three months.\"\\n\"And that is all? There are no other conditions?\"\\n\"None whatever. You would, of course, go in the character of my\\nward, and you would hold no communication with your friends. I\\nshould have to request absolute secrecy for the time being. By\\nthe way, you are English, are you not?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Yet you speak with a slight American accent?\"\\n\"My great pal in hospital was a little American girl. I dare say\\nI picked it up from her. I can soon get out of it again.\"\\n\"On the contrary, it might be simpler for you to pass as an\\nAmerican. Details about your past life in England might be more\\ndifficult to sustain. Yes, I think that would be decidedly\\nbetter. Then----\"\\n\"One moment, Mr. Whittington! You seem to be taking my consent\\nfor granted.\"\\nWhittington looked surprised.\\n\"Surely you are not thinking of refusing? I can assure you that\\nMadame Colombier\\'s is a most high-class and orthodox\\nestablishment. And the terms are most liberal.\"\\n\"Exactly,\" said Tuppence. \"That\\'s just it. The terms are almost\\ntoo liberal, Mr. Whittington. I cannot see any way in which I\\ncan be worth that amount of money to you.\"\\n\"No?\" said Whittington softly. \"Well, I will tell you. I could\\ndoubtless obtain some one else for very much less. What I am\\nwilling to pay for is a young lady with sufficient intelligence\\nand presence of mind to sustain her part well, and also one who\\nwill have sufficient discretion not to ask too many questions.\"\\nTuppence smiled a little. She felt that Whittington had scored.\\n\"There\\'s another thing. So far there has been no mention of Mr.\\nBeresford. Where does he come in?\"\\n\"Mr. Beresford?\"\\n\"My partner,\" said Tuppence with dignity. \"You saw us together\\nyesterday.\"\\n\"Ah, yes. But I\\'m afraid we shan\\'t require his services.\"\\n\"Then it\\'s off!\" Tuppence rose. \"It\\'s both or neither.\\nSorry--but that\\'s how it is. Good morning, Mr. Whittington.\"\\n\"Wait a minute. Let us see if something can\\'t be managed. Sit\\ndown again, Miss----\" He paused interrogatively.\\nTuppence\\'s conscience gave her a passing twinge as she remembered\\nthe archdeacon. She seized hurriedly on the first name that came\\ninto her head.\\n\"Jane Finn,\" she said hastily; and then paused open-mouthed at\\nthe effect of those two simple words.\\nAll the geniality had faded out of Whittington\\'s face. It was\\npurple with rage, and the veins stood out on the forehead. And\\nbehind it all there lurked a sort of incredulous dismay. He\\nleaned forward and hissed savagely:\\n\"So that\\'s your little game, is it?\"\\nTuppence, though utterly taken aback, nevertheless kept her head.\\nShe had not the faintest comprehension of his meaning, but she\\nwas naturally quick-witted, and felt it imperative to \"keep her\\nend up\" as she phrased it.\\nWhittington went on:\\n\"Been playing with me, have you, all the time, like a cat and\\nmouse? Knew all the time what I wanted you for, but kept up the\\ncomedy. Is that it, eh?\" He was cooling down. The red colour\\nwas ebbing out of his face. He eyed her keenly. \"Who\\'s been\\nblabbing? Rita?\"\\nTuppence shook her head. She was doubtful as to how long she\\ncould sustain this illusion, but she realized the importance of\\nnot dragging an unknown Rita into it.\\n\"No,\" she replied with perfect truth. \"Rita knows nothing about\\nme.\"\\nHis eyes still bored into her like gimlets.\\n\"How much do you know?\" he shot out.\\n\"Very little indeed,\" answered Tuppence, and was pleased to note\\nthat Whittington\\'s uneasiness was augmented instead of allayed.\\nTo have boasted that she knew a lot might have raised doubts in\\nhis mind.\\n\"Anyway,\" snarled Whittington, \"you knew enough to come in here\\nand plump out that name.\"\\n\"It might be my own name,\" Tuppence pointed out.\\n\"It\\'s likely, isn\\'t it, then there would be two girls with a name\\nlike that?\"\\n\"Or I might just have hit upon it by chance,\" continued Tuppence,\\nintoxicated with the success of truthfulness.\\nMr. Whittington brought his fist down upon the desk with a bang.\\n\"Quit fooling! How much do you know? And how much do you want?\"\\nThe last five words took Tuppence\\'s fancy mightily, especially\\nafter a meagre breakfast and a supper of buns the night before.\\nHer present part was of the adventuress rather than the\\nadventurous order, but she did not deny its possibilities. She\\nsat up and smiled with the air of one who has the situation\\nthoroughly well in hand.\\n\"My dear Mr. Whittington,\" she said, \"let us by all means lay our\\ncards upon the table. And pray do not be so angry. You heard me\\nsay yesterday that I proposed to live by my wits. It seems to me\\nthat I have now proved I have some wits to live by! I admit I\\nhave knowledge of a certain name, but perhaps my knowledge ends\\nthere.\"\\n\"Yes--and perhaps it doesn\\'t,\" snarled Whittington.\\n\"You insist on misjudging me,\" said Tuppence, and sighed gently.\\n\"As I said once before,\" said Whittington angrily, \"quit fooling,\\nand come to the point. You can\\'t play the innocent with me. You\\nknow a great deal more than you\\'re willing to admit.\"\\nTuppence paused a moment to admire her own ingenuity, and then\\nsaid softly:\\n\"I shouldn\\'t like to contradict you, Mr. Whittington.\"\\n\"So we come to the usual question--how much?\"\\nTuppence was in a dilemma. So far she had fooled Whittington\\nwith complete success, but to mention a palpably impossible sum\\nmight awaken his suspicions. An idea flashed across her brain.\\n\"Suppose we say a little something down, and a fuller discussion\\nof the matter later?\"\\nWhittington gave her an ugly glance.\\n\"Blackmail, eh?\"\\nTuppence smiled sweetly.\\n\"Oh no! Shall we say payment of services in advance?\"\\nWhittington grunted.\\n\"You see,\" explained Tuppence still sweetly, \"I\\'m so very fond of\\nmoney!\"\\n\"You\\'re about the limit, that\\'s what you are,\" growled\\nWhittington, with a sort of unwilling admiration. \"You took me\\nin all right. Thought you were quite a meek little kid with just\\nenough brains for my purpose.\"\\n\"Life,\" moralized Tuppence, \"is full of surprises.\"\\n\"All the same,\" continued Whittington, \"some one\\'s been talking.\\nYou say it isn\\'t Rita. Was it----? Oh, come in.\"\\nThe clerk followed his discreet knock into the room, and laid a\\npaper at his master\\'s elbow.\\n\"Telephone message just come for you, sir.\"\\nWhittington snatched it up and read it. A frown gathered on his\\nbrow.\\n\"That\\'ll do, Brown. You can go.\"\\nThe clerk withdrew, closing the door behind him. Whittington\\nturned to Tuppence.\\n\"Come to-morrow at the same time. I\\'m busy now. Here\\'s fifty to\\ngo on with.\"\\nHe rapidly sorted out some notes, and pushed them across the\\ntable to Tuppence, then stood up, obviously impatient for her to\\ngo.\\nThe girl counted the notes in a businesslike manner, secured them\\nin her handbag, and rose.\\n\"Good morning, Mr. Whittington,\" she said politely. \"At least, au\\nrevoir, I should say.\"\\n\"Exactly. Au revoir!\" Whittington looked almost genial again, a\\nreversion that aroused in Tuppence a faint misgiving. \"Au revoir,\\nmy clever and charming young lady.\"\\nTuppence sped lightly down the stairs. A wild elation possessed\\nher. A neighbouring clock showed the time to be five minutes to\\ntwelve.\\n\"Let\\'s give Tommy a surprise!\" murmured Tuppence, and hailed a\\ntaxi.\\nThe cab drew up outside the tube station. Tommy was just within\\nthe entrance. His eyes opened to their fullest extent as he\\nhurried forward to assist Tuppence to alight. She smiled at him\\naffectionately, and remarked in a slightly affected voice:\\n\"Pay the thing, will you, old bean? I\\'ve got nothing smaller\\nthan a five-pound note!\"\\nCHAPTER III\\nA SET BACK\\nTHE moment was not quite so triumphant as it ought to have been.\\nTo begin with, the resources of Tommy\\'s pockets were somewhat\\nlimited. In the end the fare was managed, the lady recollecting a\\nplebeian twopence, and the driver, still holding the varied\\nassortment of coins in his hand, was prevailed upon to move on,\\nwhich he did after one last hoarse demand as to what the\\ngentleman thought he was giving him?\\n\"I think you\\'ve given him too much, Tommy,\" said Tuppence\\ninnocently. \"I fancy he wants to give some of it back.\"\\nIt was possibly this remark which induced the driver to move\\naway.\\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Beresford, at length able to relieve his\\nfeelings, \"what the--dickens, did you want to take a taxi for?\"\\n\"I was afraid I might be late and keep you waiting,\" said\\nTuppence gently.\\n\"Afraid--you--might--be--late! Oh, Lord, I give it up!\" said Mr.\\nBeresford.\\n\"And really and truly,\" continued Tuppence, opening her eyes very\\nwide, \"I haven\\'t got anything smaller than a five-pound note.\"\\n\"You did that part of it very well, old bean, but all the same\\nthe fellow wasn\\'t taken in--not for a moment!\"\\n\"No,\" said Tuppence thoughtfully, \"he didn\\'t believe it. That\\'s\\nthe curious part about speaking the truth. No one does believe\\nit. I found that out this morning. Now let\\'s go to lunch. How\\nabout the Savoy?\"\\nTommy grinned.\\n\"How about the Ritz?\"\\n\"On second thoughts, I prefer the Piccadilly. It\\'s nearer. We\\nshan\\'t have to take another taxi. Come along.\"\\n\"Is this a new brand of humour? Or is your brain really\\nunhinged?\" inquired Tommy.\\n\"Your last supposition is the correct one. I have come into\\nmoney, and the shock has been too much for me! For that\\nparticular form of mental trouble an eminent physician recommends\\nunlimited Hors d\\'oeuvre, Lobster a l\\'americane, Chicken Newberg,\\nand Peche Melba! Let\\'s go and get them!\"\\n\"Tuppence, old girl, what has really come over you?\"\\n\"Oh, unbelieving one!\" Tuppence wrenched open her bag. \"Look\\nhere, and here, and here!\"\\n\"Great Jehosaphat! My dear girl, don\\'t wave Fishers aloft like\\nthat!\"\\n\"They\\'re not Fishers. They\\'re five times better than Fishers,\\nand this one\\'s ten times better!\"\\nTommy groaned.\\n\"I must have been drinking unawares! Am I dreaming, Tuppence, or\\ndo I really behold a large quantity of five-pound notes being\\nwaved about in a dangerous fashion?\"\\n\"Even so, O King! Now, will you come and have lunch?\"\\n\"I\\'ll come anywhere. But what have you been doing? Holding up a\\nbank?\"\\n\"All in good time. What an awful place Piccadilly Circus is.\\nThere\\'s a huge bus bearing down on us. It would be too terrible\\nif they killed the five-pound notes!\"\\n\"Grill room?\" inquired Tommy, as they reached the opposite\\npavement in safety.\\n\"The other\\'s more expensive,\" demurred Tuppence.\\n\"That\\'s mere wicked wanton extravagance. Come on below.\"\\n\"Are you sure I can get all the things I want there?\"\\n\"That extremely unwholesome menu you were outlining just now? Of\\ncourse you can--or as much as is good for you, anyway.\"\\n\"And now tell me,\" said Tommy, unable to restrain his pent-up\\ncuriosity any longer, as they sat in state surrounded by the many\\nhors d\\'oeuvre of Tuppence\\'s dreams.\\nMiss Cowley told him.\\n\"And the curious part of it is,\" she ended, \"that I really did\\ninvent the name of Jane Finn! I didn\\'t want to give my own\\nbecause of poor father--in case I should get mixed up in anything\\nshady.\"\\n\"Perhaps that\\'s so,\" said Tommy slowly. \"But you didn\\'t invent\\nit.\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"No. I told it to you. Don\\'t you remember, I said yesterday I\\'d\\noverheard two people talking about a female called Jane Finn?\\nThat\\'s what brought the name into your mind so pat.\"\\n\"So you did. I remember now. How extraordinary----\" Tuppence\\ntailed off into silence. Suddenly she aroused herself. \"Tommy!\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"What were they like, the two men you passed?\"\\nTommy frowned in an effort at remembrance.\\n\"One was a big fat sort of chap. Clean shaven, I think--and\\ndark.\"\\n\"That\\'s him,\" cried Tuppence, in an ungrammatical squeal. \"That\\'s\\nWhittington! What was the other man like?\"\\n\"I can\\'t remember. I didn\\'t notice him particularly. It was\\nreally the outlandish name that caught my attention.\"\\n\"And people say that coincidences don\\'t happen!\" Tuppence tackled\\nher Peche Melba happily.\\nBut Tommy had become serious.\\n\"Look here, Tuppence, old girl, what is this going to lead to?\"\\n\"More money,\" replied his companion.\\n\"I know that. You\\'ve only got one idea in your head. What I mean\\nis, what about the next step? How are you going to keep the game\\nup?\"\\n\"Oh!\" Tuppence laid down her spoon. \"You\\'re right, Tommy, it is\\na bit of a poser.\"\\n\"After all, you know, you can\\'t bluff him forever. You\\'re sure to\\nslip up sooner or later. And, anyway, I\\'m not at all sure that\\nit isn\\'t actionable--blackmail, you know.\"\\n\"Nonsense. Blackmail is saying you\\'ll tell unless you are given\\nmoney. Now, there\\'s nothing I could tell, because I don\\'t really\\nknow anything.\"\\n\"Hm,\" said Tommy doubtfully. \"Well, anyway, what ARE we going to\\ndo? Whittington was in a hurry to get rid of you this morning,\\nbut next time he\\'ll want to know something more before he parts\\nwith his money. He\\'ll want to know how much YOU know, and where\\nyou got your information from, and a lot of other things that you\\ncan\\'t cope with. What are you going to do about it?\"\\nTuppence frowned severely.\\n\"We must think. Order some Turkish coffee, Tommy. Stimulating\\nto the brain. Oh, dear, what a lot I have eaten!\"\\n\"You have made rather a hog of yourself! So have I for that\\nmatter, but I flatter myself that my choice of dishes was more\\njudicious than yours. Two coffees.\" (This was to the waiter.)\\n\"One Turkish, one French.\"\\nTuppence sipped her coffee with a deeply reflective air, and\\nsnubbed Tommy when he spoke to her.\\n\"Be quiet. I\\'m thinking.\"\\n\"Shades of Pelmanism!\" said Tommy, and relapsed into silence.\\n\"There!\" said Tuppence at last. \"I\\'ve got a plan. Obviously what\\nwe\\'ve got to do is to find out more about it all.\"\\nTommy applauded.\\n\"Don\\'t jeer. We can only find out through Whittington. We must\\ndiscover where he lives, what he does--sleuth him, in fact! Now I\\ncan\\'t do it, because he knows me, but he only saw you for a\\nminute or two in Lyons\\'. He\\'s not likely to recognize you. After\\nall, one young man is much like another.\"\\n\"I repudiate that remark utterly. I\\'m sure my pleasing features\\nand distinguished appearance would single me out from any crowd.\"\\n\"My plan is this,\" Tuppence went on calmly, \"I\\'ll go alone\\nto-morrow. I\\'ll put him off again like I did to-day. It doesn\\'t\\nmatter if I don\\'t get any more money at once. Fifty pounds ought\\nto last us a few days.\"\\n\"Or even longer!\"\\n\"You\\'ll hang about outside. When I come out I shan\\'t speak to\\nyou in case he\\'s watching. But I\\'ll take up my stand somewhere\\nnear, and when he comes out of the building I\\'ll drop a\\nhandkerchief or something, and off you go!\"\\n\"Off I go where?\"\\n\"Follow him, of course, silly! What do you think of the idea?\"\\n\"Sort of thing one reads about in books. I somehow feel that in\\nreal life one will feel a bit of an ass standing in the street\\nfor hours with nothing to do. People will wonder what I\\'m up\\nto.\"\\n\"Not in the city. Every one\\'s in such a hurry. Probably no one\\nwill even notice you at all.\"\\n\"That\\'s the second time you\\'ve made that sort of remark. Never\\nmind, I forgive you. Anyway, it will be rather a lark. What are\\nyou doing this afternoon?\"\\n\"Well,\" said Tuppence meditatively. \"I HAD thought of hats! Or\\nperhaps silk stockings! Or perhaps----\"\\n\"Hold hard,\" admonished Tommy. \"There\\'s a limit to fifty pounds!\\nBut let\\'s do dinner and a show to-night at all events.\"\\n\"Rather.\"\\nThe day passed pleasantly. The evening even more so. Two of the\\nfive-pound notes were now irretrievably dead.\\nThey met by arrangement the following morning and proceeded\\ncitywards. Tommy remained on the opposite side of the road while\\nTuppence plunged into the building.\\nTommy strolled slowly down to the end of the street, then back\\nagain. Just as he came abreast of the building, Tuppence darted\\nacross the road.\\n\"Tommy!\"\\n\"Yes. What\\'s up?\"\\n\"The place is shut. I can\\'t make anyone hear.\"\\n\"That\\'s odd.\"\\n\"Isn\\'t it? Come up with me, and let\\'s try again.\"\\nTommy followed her. As they passed the third floor landing a\\nyoung clerk came out of an office. He hesitated a moment, then\\naddressed himself to Tuppence.\\n\"Were you wanting the Esthonia Glassware?\"\\n\"Yes, please.\"\\n\"It\\'s closed down. Since yesterday afternoon. Company being\\nwound up, they say. Not that I\\'ve ever heard of it myself. But\\nanyway the office is to let.\"\\n\"Th--thank you,\" faltered Tuppence. \"I suppose you don\\'t know\\nMr. Whittington\\'s address?\"\\n\"Afraid I don\\'t. They left rather suddenly.\"\\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Tommy. \"Come on, Tuppence.\"\\nThey descended to the street again where they gazed at one\\nanother blankly.\\n\"That\\'s torn it,\" said Tommy at length.\\n\"And I never suspected it,\" wailed Tuppence.\\n\"Cheer up, old thing, it can\\'t be helped.\"\\n\"Can\\'t it, though!\" Tuppence\\'s little chin shot out defiantly.\\n\"Do you think this is the end? If so, you\\'re wrong. It\\'s just\\nthe beginning!\"\\n\"The beginning of what?\"\\n\"Of our adventure! Tommy, don\\'t you see, if they are scared\\nenough to run away like this, it shows that there must be a lot\\nin this Jane Finn business! Well, we\\'ll get to the bottom of it.\\nWe\\'ll run them down! We\\'ll be sleuths in earnest!\"\\n\"Yes, but there\\'s no one left to sleuth.\"\\n\"No, that\\'s why we\\'ll have to start all over again. Lend me that\\nbit of pencil. Thanks. Wait a minute--don\\'t interrupt. There!\"\\nTuppence handed back the pencil, and surveyed the piece of paper\\non which she had written with a satisfied eye:\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\n\"Advertisement.\"\\n\"You\\'re not going to put that thing in after all?\"\\n\"No, it\\'s a different one.\" She handed him the slip of paper.\\nTommy read the words on it aloud:\\n\"WANTED, any information respecting Jane Finn. Apply Y.A.\"\\nCHAPTER IV\\nWHO IS JANE FINN?\\nTHE next day passed slowly. It was necessary to curtail\\nexpenditure. Carefully husbanded, forty pounds will last a long\\ntime. Luckily the weather was fine, and \"walking is cheap,\"\\ndictated Tuppence. An outlying picture house provided them with\\nrecreation for the evening.\\nThe day of disillusionment had been a Wednesday. On Thursday the\\nadvertisement had duly appeared. On Friday letters might be\\nexpected to arrive at Tommy\\'s rooms.\\nHe had been bound by an honourable promise not to open any such\\nletters if they did arrive, but to repair to the National\\nGallery, where his colleague would meet him at ten o\\'clock.\\nTuppence was first at the rendezvous. She ensconced herself on a\\nred velvet seat, and gazed at the Turners with unseeing eyes\\nuntil she saw the familiar figure enter the room.\\n\"Well?\"\\n\"Well,\" returned Mr. Beresford provokingly. \"Which is your\\nfavourite picture?\"\\n\"Don\\'t be a wretch. Aren\\'t there ANY answers?\"\\nTommy shook his head with a deep and somewhat overacted\\nmelancholy.\\n\"I didn\\'t want to disappoint you, old thing, by telling you right\\noff. It\\'s too bad. Good money wasted.\" He sighed. \"Still,\\nthere it is. The advertisement has appeared, and--there are only\\ntwo answers!\"\\n\"Tommy, you devil!\" almost screamed Tuppence. \"Give them to me.\\nHow could you be so mean!\"\\n\"Your language, Tuppence, your language! They\\'re very particular\\nat the National Gallery. Government show, you know. And do\\nremember, as I have pointed out to you before, that as a\\nclergyman\\'s daughter----\"\\n\"I ought to be on the stage!\" finished Tuppence with a snap.\\n\"That is not what I intended to say. But if you are sure that\\nyou have enjoyed to the full the reaction of joy after despair\\nwith which I have kindly provided you free of charge, let us get\\ndown to our mail, as the saying goes.\"\\nTuppence snatched the two precious envelopes from him\\nunceremoniously, and scrutinized them carefully.\\n\"Thick paper, this one. It looks rich. We\\'ll keep it to the\\nlast and open the other first.\"\\n\"Right you are. One, two, three, go!\"\\nTuppence\\'s little thumb ripped open the envelope, and she\\nextracted the contents.\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\n\"Referring to your advertisement in this morning\\'s paper, I may\\nbe able to be of some use to you. Perhaps you could call and see\\nme at the above address at eleven o\\'clock to-morrow morning.\\n\"Yours truly,\\n\"A. CARTER.\\n\"27 Carshalton Gardens,\" said Tuppence, referring to the address.\\n\"That\\'s Gloucester Road way. Plenty of time to get there if we\\ntube.\"\\n\"The following,\" said Tommy, \"is the plan of campaign. It is my\\nturn to assume the offensive. Ushered into the presence of Mr.\\nCarter, he and I wish each other good morning as is customary. He\\nthen says: \\'Please take a seat, Mr.--er?\\' To which I reply\\npromptly and significantly: \\'Edward Whittington!\\' whereupon Mr.\\nCarter turns purple in the face and gasps out: \\'How much?\\'\\nPocketing the usual fee of fifty pounds, I rejoin you in the road\\noutside, and we proceed to the next address and repeat the\\nperformance.\"\\n\"Don\\'t be absurd, Tommy. Now for the other letter. Oh, this is\\nfrom the Ritz!\"\\n\"A hundred pounds instead of fifty!\"\\n\"I\\'ll read it:\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\n\"Re your advertisement, I should be glad if you would call round\\nsomewhere about lunch-time.\\n\"Yours truly,\\n\"JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER.\"\\n\"Ha!\" said Tommy. \"Do I smell a Boche? Or only an American\\nmillionaire of unfortunate ancestry? At all events we\\'ll call at\\nlunch-time. It\\'s a good time--frequently leads to free food for\\ntwo.\"\\nTuppence nodded assent.\\n\"Now for Carter. We\\'ll have to hurry.\"\\nCarshalton Terrace proved to be an unimpeachable row of what\\nTuppence called \"ladylike looking houses.\" They rang the bell at\\nNo. 27, and a neat maid answered the door. She looked so\\nrespectable that Tuppence\\'s heart sank. Upon Tommy\\'s request for\\nMr. Carter, she showed them into a small study on the ground\\nfloor where she left them. Hardly a minute elapsed, however,\\nbefore the door opened, and a tall man with a lean hawklike face\\nand a tired manner entered the room.\\n\"Mr. Y. A.?\" he said, and smiled. His smile was distinctly\\nattractive. \"Do sit down, both of you.\"\\nThey obeyed. He himself took a chair opposite to Tuppence and\\nsmiled at her encouragingly. There was something in the quality\\nof his smile that made the girl\\'s usual readiness desert her.\\nAs he did not seem inclined to open the conversation, Tuppence\\nwas forced to begin.\\n\"We wanted to know--that is, would you be so kind as to tell us\\nanything you know about Jane Finn?\"\\n\"Jane Finn? Ah!\" Mr. Carter appeared to reflect. \"Well, the\\nquestion is, what do you know about her?\"\\nTuppence drew herself up.\\n\"I don\\'t see that that\\'s got anything to do with it.\"\\n\"No? But it has, you know, really it has.\" He smiled again in\\nhis tired way, and continued reflectively. \"So that brings us\\ndown to it again. What do you know about Jane Finn?\\n\"Come now,\" he continued, as Tuppence remained silent. \"You must\\nknow SOMETHING to have advertised as you did?\" He leaned forward\\na little, his weary voice held a hint of persuasiveness. \"Suppose\\nyou tell me . . .\"\\nThere was something very magnetic about Mr. Carter\\'s personality.\\nTuppence seemed to shake herself free of it with an effort, as\\nshe said:\\n\"We couldn\\'t do that, could we, Tommy?\"\\nBut to her surprise, her companion did not back her up. His eyes\\nwere fixed on Mr. Carter, and his tone when he spoke held an\\nunusual note of deference.\\n\"I dare say the little we know won\\'t be any good to you, sir. But\\nsuch as it is, you\\'re welcome to it.\"\\n\"Tommy!\" cried out Tuppence in surprise.\\nMr. Carter slewed round in his chair. His eyes asked a question.\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"Yes, sir, I recognized you at once. Saw you in France when I\\nwas with the Intelligence. As soon as you came into the room, I\\nknew----\"\\nMr. Carter held up his hand.\\n\"No names, please. I\\'m known as Mr. Carter here. It\\'s my\\ncousin\\'s house, by the way. She\\'s willing to lend it to me\\nsometimes when it\\'s a case of working on strictly unofficial\\nlines. Well, now\"--he looked from one to the other--\"who\\'s going\\nto tell me the story?\"\\n\"Fire ahead, Tuppence,\" directed Tommy. \"It\\'s your yarn.\"\\n\"Yes, little lady, out with it.\"\\nAnd obediently Tuppence did out with it, telling the whole story\\nfrom the forming of the Young Adventurers, Ltd., downwards.\\nMr. Carter listened in silence with a resumption of his tired\\nmanner. Now and then he passed his hand across his lips as though\\nto hide a smile. When she had finished he nodded gravely.\\n\"Not much. But suggestive. Quite suggestive. If you\\'ll excuse\\nmy saying so, you\\'re a curious young couple. I don\\'t know--you\\nmight succeed where others have failed . . . I believe in luck,\\nyou know--always have....\"\\nHe paused a moment, and then went on.\\n\"Well, how about it? You\\'re out for adventure. How would you\\nlike to work for me? All quite unofficial, you know. Expenses\\npaid, and a moderate screw?\"\\nTuppence gazed at him, her lips parted, her eyes growing wider\\nand wider.\\n\"What should we have to do?\" she breathed.\\nMr. Carter smiled.\\n\"Just go on with what you\\'re doing now. FIND JANE FINN.\"\\n\"Yes, but--who IS Jane Finn?\"\\nMr. Carter nodded gravely.\\n\"Yes, you\\'re entitled to know that, I think.\"\\nHe leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs, brought the tips\\nof his fingers together, and began in a low monotone:\\n\"Secret diplomacy (which, by the way, is nearly always bad\\npolicy!) does not concern you. It will be sufficient to say that\\nin the early days of 1915 a certain document came into being. It\\nwas the draft of a secret agreement--treaty--call it what you\\nlike. It was drawn up ready for signature by the various\\nrepresentatives, and drawn up in America--at that time a neutral\\ncountry. It was dispatched to England by a special messenger\\nselected for that purpose, a young fellow called Danvers. It was\\nhoped that the whole affair had been kept so secret that nothing\\nwould have leaked out. That kind of hope is usually\\ndisappointed. Somebody always talks!\\n\"Danvers sailed for England on the Lusitania. He carried the\\nprecious papers in an oilskin packet which he wore next his skin.\\nIt was on that particular voyage that the Lusitania was torpedoed\\nand sunk. Danvers was among the list of those missing.\\nEventually his body was washed ashore, and identified beyond any\\npossible doubt. But the oilskin packet was missing!\\n\"The question was, had it been taken from him, or had he himself\\npassed it on into another\\'s keeping? There were a few incidents\\nthat strengthened the possibility of the latter theory. After the\\ntorpedo struck the ship, in the few moments during the launching\\nof the boats, Danvers was seen speaking to a young American girl.\\nNo one actually saw him pass anything to her, but he might have\\ndone so. It seems to me quite likely that he entrusted the papers\\nto this girl, believing that she, as a woman, had a greater\\nchance of bringing them safely to shore.\\n\"But if so, where was the girl, and what had she done with the\\npapers? By later advice from America it seemed likely that\\nDanvers had been closely shadowed on the way over. Was this girl\\nin league with his enemies? Or had she, in her turn, been\\nshadowed and either tricked or forced into handing over the\\nprecious packet?\\n\"We set to work to trace her out. It proved unexpectedly\\ndifficult. Her name was Jane Finn, and it duly appeared among the\\nlist of the survivors, but the girl herself seemed to have\\nvanished completely. Inquiries into her antecedents did little to\\nhelp us. She was an orphan, and had been what we should call\\nover here a pupil teacher in a small school out West. Her\\npassport had been made out for Paris, where she was going to join\\nthe staff of a hospital. She had offered her services\\nvoluntarily, and after some correspondence they had been\\naccepted. Having seen her name in the list of the saved from the\\nLusitania, the staff of the hospital were naturally very\\nsurprised at her not arriving to take up her billet, and at not\\nhearing from her in any way.\\n\"Well, every effort was made to trace the young lady--but all in\\nvain. We tracked her across Ireland, but nothing could be heard\\nof her after she set foot in England. No use was made of the\\ndraft treaty--as might very easily have been done--and we\\ntherefore came to the conclusion that Danvers had, after all,\\ndestroyed it. The war entered on another phase, the diplomatic\\naspect changed accordingly, and the treaty was never redrafted.\\nRumours as to its existence were emphatically denied. The\\ndisappearance of Jane Finn was forgotten and the whole affair was\\nlost in oblivion.\"\\nMr. Carter paused, and Tuppence broke in impatiently:\\n\"But why has it all cropped up again? The war\\'s over.\"\\nA hint of alertness came into Mr. Carter\\'s manner.\\n\"Because it seems that the papers were not destroyed after all,\\nand that they might be resurrected to-day with a new and deadly\\nsignificance.\"\\nTuppence stared. Mr. Carter nodded.\\n\"Yes, five years ago, that draft treaty was a weapon in our\\nhands; to-day it is a weapon against us. It was a gigantic\\nblunder. If its terms were made public, it would mean\\ndisaster.... It might possibly bring about another war--not with\\nGermany this time! That is an extreme possibility, and I do not\\nbelieve in its likelihood myself, but that document undoubtedly\\nimplicates a number of our statesmen whom we cannot afford to\\nhave discredited in any way at the present moment. As a party\\ncry for Labour it would be irresistible, and a Labour Government\\nat this juncture would, in my opinion, be a grave disability for\\nBritish trade, but that is a mere nothing to the REAL danger.\"\\nHe paused, and then said quietly:\\n\"You may perhaps have heard or read that there is Bolshevist\\ninfluence at work behind the present Labour unrest?\"\\nTuppence nodded.\\n\"That is the truth. Bolshevist gold is pouring into this country\\nfor the specific purpose of procuring a Revolution. And there is\\na certain man, a man whose real name is unknown to us, who is\\nworking in the dark for his own ends. The Bolshevists are behind\\nthe Labour unrest--but this man is BEHIND THE BOLSHEVISTS. Who\\nis he? We do not know. He is always spoken of by the unassuming\\ntitle of \\'Mr. Brown.\\' But one thing is certain, he is the master\\ncriminal of this age. He controls a marvellous organization.\\nMost of the Peace propaganda during the war was originated and\\nfinanced by him. His spies are everywhere.\"\\n\"A naturalized German?\" asked Tommy.\\n\"On the contrary, I have every reason to believe he is an\\nEnglishman. He was pro-German, as he would have been pro-Boer.\\nWhat he seeks to attain we do not know--probably supreme power\\nfor himself, of a kind unique in history. We have no clue as to\\nhis real personality. It is reported that even his own followers\\nare ignorant of it. Where we have come across his tracks, he has\\nalways played a secondary part. Somebody else assumes the chief\\nrole. But afterwards we always find that there has been some\\nnonentity, a servant or a clerk, who has remained in the\\nbackground unnoticed, and that the elusive Mr. Brown has escaped\\nus once more.\"\\n\"Oh!\" Tuppence jumped. \"I wonder----\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"I remember in Mr. Whittington\\'s office. The clerk--he called\\nhim Brown. You don\\'t think----\"\\nCarter nodded thoughtfully.\\n\"Very likely. A curious point is that the name is usually\\nmentioned. An idiosyncrasy of genius. Can you describe him at\\nall?\"\\n\"I really didn\\'t notice. He was quite ordinary--just like anyone\\nelse.\"\\nMr. Carter sighed in his tired manner.\\n\"That is the invariable description of Mr. Brown! Brought a\\ntelephone message to the man Whittington, did he? Notice a\\ntelephone in the outer office?\"\\nTuppence thought.\\n\"No, I don\\'t think I did.\"\\n\"Exactly. That \\'message\\' was Mr. Brown\\'s way of giving an order\\nto his subordinate. He overheard the whole conversation of\\ncourse. Was it after that that Whittington handed you over the\\nmoney, and told you to come the following day?\"\\nTuppence nodded.\\n\"Yes, undoubtedly the hand of Mr. Brown!\" Mr. Carter paused.\\n\"Well, there it is, you see what you are pitting yourselves\\nagainst? Possibly the finest criminal brain of the age. I don\\'t\\nquite like it, you know. You\\'re such young things, both of you.\\nI shouldn\\'t like anything to happen to you.\"\\n\"It won\\'t,\" Tuppence assured him positively.\\n\"I\\'ll look after her, sir,\" said Tommy.\\n\"And I\\'ll look after YOU,\" retorted Tuppence, resenting the manly\\nassertion.\\n\"Well, then, look after each other,\" said Mr. Carter, smiling.\\n\"Now let\\'s get back to business. There\\'s something mysterious\\nabout this draft treaty that we haven\\'t fathomed yet. We\\'ve been\\nthreatened with it--in plain and unmistakable terms. The\\nRevolutionary element as good as declare that it\\'s in their\\nhands, and that they intend to produce it at a given moment. On\\nthe other hand, they are clearly at fault about many of its\\nprovisions. The Government consider it as mere bluff on their\\npart, and, rightly or wrongly, have stuck to the policy of\\nabsolute denial. I\\'m not so sure. There have been hints,\\nindiscreet allusions, that seem to indicate that the menace is a\\nreal one. The position is much as though they had got hold of an\\nincriminating document, but couldn\\'t read it because it was in\\ncipher--but we know that the draft treaty wasn\\'t in\\ncipher--couldn\\'t be in the nature of things--so that won\\'t wash.\\nBut there\\'s SOMETHING. Of course, Jane Finn may be dead for all\\nwe know--but I don\\'t think so. The curious thing is that THEY\\'RE\\nTRYING TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE GIRL FROM US\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"Yes. One or two little things have cropped up. And your story,\\nlittle lady, confirms my idea. They know we\\'re looking for Jane\\nFinn. Well, they\\'ll produce a Jane Finn of their own--say at a\\npensionnat in Paris.\" Tuppence gasped, and Mr. Carter smiled.\\n\"No one knows in the least what she looks like, so that\\'s all\\nright. She\\'s primed with a trumped-up tale, and her real business\\nis to get as much information as possible out of us. See the\\nidea?\"\\n\"Then you think\"--Tuppence paused to grasp the supposition\\nfully--\"that it WAS as Jane Finn that they wanted me to go to\\nParis?\"\\nMr. Carter smiled more wearily than ever.\\n\"I believe in coincidences, you know,\" he said.\\nCHAPTER V\\nMR. JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER\\n\"WELL,\" said Tuppence, recovering herself, \"it really seems as\\nthough it were meant to be.\"\\nCarter nodded.\\n\"I know what you mean. I\\'m superstitious myself. Luck, and all\\nthat sort of thing. Fate seems to have chosen you out to be\\nmixed up in this.\"\\nTommy indulged in a chuckle.\\n\"My word! I don\\'t wonder Whittington got the wind up when\\nTuppence plumped out that name! I should have myself. But look\\nhere, sir, we\\'re taking up an awful lot of your time. Have you\\nany tips to give us before we clear out?\"\\n\"I think not. My experts, working in stereotyped ways, have\\nfailed. You will bring imagination and an open mind to the task.\\nDon\\'t be discouraged if that too does not succeed. For one thing\\nthere is a likelihood of the pace being forced.\"\\nTuppence frowned uncomprehendingly.\\n\"When you had that interview with Whittington, they had time\\nbefore them. I have information that the big coup was planned for\\nearly in the new year. But the Government is contemplating\\nlegislative action which will deal effectually with the strike\\nmenace. They\\'ll get wind of it soon, if they haven\\'t already,\\nand it\\'s possible that that may bring things to a head. I hope it\\nwill myself. The less time they have to mature their plans the\\nbetter. I\\'m just warning you that you haven\\'t much time before\\nyou, and that you needn\\'t be cast down if you fail. It\\'s not an\\neasy proposition anyway. That\\'s all.\"\\nTuppence rose.\\n\"I think we ought to be businesslike. What exactly can we count\\nupon you for, Mr. Carter?\" Mr. Carter\\'s lips twitched slightly,\\nbut he replied succinctly: \"Funds within reason, detailed\\ninformation on any point, and NO OFFICIAL RECOGNITION. I mean\\nthat if you get yourselves into trouble with the police, I can\\'t\\nofficially help you out of it. You\\'re on your own.\"\\nTuppence nodded sagely.\\n\"I quite understand that. I\\'ll write out a list of the things I\\nwant to know when I\\'ve had time to think. Now--about money----\"\\n\"Yes, Miss Tuppence. Do you want to say how much?\"\\n\"Not exactly. We\\'ve got plenty to go with for the present, but\\nwhen we want more----\"\\n\"It will be waiting for you.\"\\n\"Yes, but--I\\'m sure I don\\'t want to be rude about the Government\\nif you\\'ve got anything to do with it, but you know one really has\\nthe devil of a time getting anything out of it! And if we have to\\nfill up a blue form and send it in, and then, after three months,\\nthey send us a green one, and so on--well, that won\\'t be much\\nuse, will it?\"\\nMr. Carter laughed outright.\\n\"Don\\'t worry, Miss Tuppence. You will send a personal demand to\\nme here, and the money, in notes, shall be sent by return of\\npost. As to salary, shall we say at the rate of three hundred a\\nyear? And an equal sum for Mr. Beresford, of course.\"\\nTuppence beamed upon him.\\n\"How lovely. You are kind. I do love money! I\\'ll keep\\nbeautiful accounts of our expenses all debit and credit, and the\\nbalance on the right side, and red line drawn sideways with the\\ntotals the same at the bottom. I really know how to do it when I\\nthink.\"\\n\"I\\'m sure you do. Well, good-bye, and good luck to you both.\"\\nHe shook hands with them, and in another minute they were\\ndescending the steps of 27 Carshalton Terrace with their heads in\\na whirl.\\n\"Tommy! Tell me at once, who is \\'Mr. Carter\\'?\"\\nTommy murmured a name in her ear.\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence, impressed.\\n\"And I can tell you, old bean, he\\'s IT!\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence again. Then she added reflectively,\\n\"I like him, don\\'t you? He looks so awfully tired and bored, and\\nyet you feel that underneath he\\'s just like steel, all keen and\\nflashing. Oh!\" She gave a skip. \"Pinch me, Tommy, do pinch me.\\nI can\\'t believe it\\'s real!\"\\nMr. Beresford obliged.\\n\"Ow! That\\'s enough! Yes, we\\'re not dreaming. We\\'ve got a job!\"\\n\"And what a job! The joint venture has really begun.\"\\n\"It\\'s more respectable than I thought it would be,\" said Tuppence\\nthoughtfully.\\n\"Luckily I haven\\'t got your craving for crime! What time is it?\\nLet\\'s have lunch--oh!\"\\nThe same thought sprang to the minds of each. Tommy voiced it\\nfirst.\\n\"Julius P. Hersheimmer!\"\\n\"We never told Mr. Carter about hearing from him.\"\\n\"Well, there wasn\\'t much to tell--not till we\\'ve seen him. Come\\non, we\\'d better take a taxi.\"\\n\"Now who\\'s being extravagant?\"\\n\"All expenses paid, remember. Hop in.\"\\n\"At any rate, we shall make a better effect arriving this way,\"\\nsaid Tuppence, leaning back luxuriously. \"I\\'m sure blackmailers\\nnever arrive in buses!\"\\n\"We\\'ve ceased being blackmailers,\" Tommy pointed out.\\n\"I\\'m not sure I have,\" said Tuppence darkly.\\nOn inquiring for Mr. Hersheimmer, they were at once taken up to\\nhis suite. An impatient voice cried \"Come in\" in answer to the\\npage-boy\\'s knock, and the lad stood aside to let them pass in.\\nMr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was a great deal younger than either\\nTommy or Tuppence had pictured him. The girl put him down as\\nthirty-five. He was of middle height, and squarely built to match\\nhis jaw. His face was pugnacious but pleasant. No one could have\\nmistaken him for anything but an American, though he spoke with\\nvery little accent.\\n\"Get my note? Sit down and tell me right away all you know about\\nmy cousin.\"\\n\"Your cousin?\"\\n\"Sure thing. Jane Finn.\"\\n\"Is she your cousin?\"\\n\"My father and her mother were brother and sister,\" explained Mr.\\nHersheimmer meticulously.\\n\"Oh!\" cried Tuppence. \"Then you know where she is?\"\\n\"No!\" Mr. Hersheimmer brought down his fist with a bang on the\\ntable. \"I\\'m darned if I do! Don\\'t you?\"\\n\"We advertised to receive information, not to give it,\" said\\nTuppence severely.\\n\"I guess I know that. I can read. But I thought maybe it was\\nher back history you were after, and that you\\'d know where she\\nwas now?\"\\n\"Well, we wouldn\\'t mind hearing her back history,\" said Tuppence\\nguardedly.\\nBut Mr. Hersheimmer seemed to grow suddenly suspicious.\\n\"See here,\" he declared. \"This isn\\'t Sicily! No demanding\\nransom or threatening to crop her ears if I refuse. These are the\\nBritish Isles, so quit the funny business, or I\\'ll just sing out\\nfor that beautiful big British policeman I see out there in\\nPiccadilly.\"\\nTommy hastened to explain.\\n\"We haven\\'t kidnapped your cousin. On the contrary, we\\'re trying\\nto find her. We\\'re employed to do so.\"\\nMr. Hersheimmer leant back in his chair.\\n\"Put me wise,\" he said succinctly.\\nTommy fell in with this demand in so far as he gave him a guarded\\nversion of the disappearance of Jane Finn, and of the possibility\\nof her having been mixed up unawares in \"some political show.\" He\\nalluded to Tuppence and himself as \"private inquiry agents\"\\ncommissioned to find her, and added that they would therefore be\\nglad of any details Mr. Hersheimmer could give them.\\nThat gentleman nodded approval.\\n\"I guess that\\'s all right. I was just a mite hasty. But London\\ngets my goat! I only know little old New York. Just trot out\\nyour questions and I\\'ll answer.\"\\nFor the moment this paralysed the Young Adventurers, but\\nTuppence, recovering herself, plunged boldly into the breach with\\na reminiscence culled from detective fiction.\\n\"When did you last see the dece--your cousin, I mean?\"\\n\"Never seen her,\" responded Mr. Hersheimmer.\\n\"What?\" demanded Tommy, astonished.\\nHersheimmer turned to him.\\n\"No, sir. As I said before, my father and her mother were\\nbrother and sister, just as you might be\"--Tommy did not correct\\nthis view of their relationship--\"but they didn\\'t always get on\\ntogether. And when my aunt made up her mind to marry Amos Finn,\\nwho was a poor school teacher out West, my father was just mad!\\nSaid if he made his pile, as he seemed in a fair way to do, she\\'d\\nnever see a cent of it. Well, the upshot was that Aunt Jane went\\nout West and we never heard from her again.\\n\"The old man DID pile it up. He went into oil, and he went into\\nsteel, and he played a bit with railroads, and I can tell you he\\nmade Wall Street sit up!\" He paused. \"Then he died--last\\nfall--and I got the dollars. Well, would you believe it, my\\nconscience got busy! Kept knocking me up and saying: What\\nabour{sic} your Aunt Jane, way out West? It worried me some. You\\nsee, I figured it out that Amos Finn would never make good. He\\nwasn\\'t the sort. End of it was, I hired a man to hunt her down.\\nResult, she was dead, and Amos Finn was dead, but they\\'d left a\\ndaughter--Jane--who\\'d been torpedoed in the Lusitania on her way\\nto Paris. She was saved all right, but they didn\\'t seem able to\\nhear of her over this side. I guessed they weren\\'t hustling any,\\nso I thought I\\'d come along over, and speed things up. I phoned\\nScotland Yard and the Admiralty first thing. The Admiralty\\nrather choked me off, but Scotland Yard were very civil--said\\nthey would make inquiries, even sent a man round this morning to\\nget her photograph. I\\'m off to Paris to-morrow, just to see what\\nthe Prefecture is doing. I guess if I go to and fro hustling\\nthem, they ought to get busy!\"\\nThe energy of Mr. Hersheimmer was tremendous. They bowed before\\nit.\\n\"But say now,\" he ended, \"you\\'re not after her for anything?\\nContempt of court, or something British? A proud-spirited young\\nAmerican girl might find your rules and regulations in war time\\nrather irksome, and get up against it. If that\\'s the case, and\\nthere\\'s such a thing as graft in this country, I\\'ll buy her off.\"\\nTuppence reassured him.\\n\"That\\'s good. Then we can work together. What about some lunch?\\nShall we have it up here, or go down to the restaurant?\"\\nTuppence expressed a preference for the latter, and Julius bowed\\nto her decision.\\nOysters had just given place to Sole Colbert when a card was\\nbrought to Hersheimmer.\\n\"Inspector Japp, C.I.D. Scotland Yard again. Another man this\\ntime. What does he expect I can tell him that I didn\\'t tell the\\nfirst chap? I hope they haven\\'t lost that photograph. That\\nWestern photographer\\'s place was burned down and all his\\nnegatives destroyed--this is the only copy in existence. I got it\\nfrom the principal of the college there.\"\\nAn unformulated dread swept over Tuppence.\\n\"You--you don\\'t know the name of the man who came this morning?\"\\n\"Yes, I do. No, I don\\'t. Half a second. It was on his card.\\nOh, I know! Inspector Brown. Quiet, unassuming sort of chap.\"\\nCHAPTER VI\\nA PLAN OF CAMPAIGN\\nA veil might with profit be drawn over the events of the next\\nhalf-hour. Suffice it to say that no such person as \"Inspector\\nBrown\" was known to Scotland Yard. The photograph of Jane Finn,\\nwhich would have been of the utmost value to the police in\\ntracing her, was lost beyond recovery. Once again \"Mr. Brown\" had\\ntriumphed.\\nThe immediate result of this set back was to effect a\\nrapprochement between Julius Hersheimmer and the Young\\nAdventurers. All barriers went down with a crash, and Tommy and\\nTuppence felt they had known the young American all their lives.\\nThey abandoned the discreet reticence of \"private inquiry\\nagents,\" and revealed to him the whole history of the joint\\nventure, whereat the young man declared himself \"tickled to\\ndeath.\"\\nHe turned to Tuppence at the close of the narration.\\n\"I\\'ve always had a kind of idea that English girls were just a\\nmite moss-grown. Old-fashioned and sweet, you know, but scared to\\nmove round without a footman or a maiden aunt. I guess I\\'m a bit\\nbehind the times!\"\\nThe upshot of these confidential relations was that Tommy and\\nTuppence took up their abode forthwith at the Ritz, in order, as\\nTuppence put it, to keep in touch with Jane Finn\\'s only living\\nrelation. \"And put like that,\" she added confidentially to Tommy,\\n\"nobody could boggle at the expense!\"\\nNobody did, which was the great thing.\\n\"And now,\" said the young lady on the morning after their\\ninstallation, \"to work!\"\\nMr. Beresford put down the Daily Mail, which he was reading, and\\napplauded with somewhat unnecessary vigour. He was politely\\nrequested by his colleague not to be an ass.\\n\"Dash it all, Tommy, we\\'ve got to DO something for our money.\"\\nTommy sighed.\\n\"Yes, I fear even the dear old Government will not support us at\\nthe Ritz in idleness for ever.\"\\n\"Therefore, as I said before, we must DO something.\"\\n\"Well,\" said Tommy, picking up the Daily Mail again, \"DO it. I\\nshan\\'t stop you.\"\\n\"You see,\" continued Tuppence. \"I\\'ve been thinking----\"\\nShe was interrupted by a fresh bout of applause.\\n\"It\\'s all very well for you to sit there being funny, Tommy. It\\nwould do you no harm to do a little brain work too.\"\\n\"My union, Tuppence, my union! It does not permit me to work\\nbefore 11 a.m.\"\\n\"Tommy, do you want something thrown at you? It is absolutely\\nessential that we should without delay map out a plan of\\ncampaign.\"\\n\"Hear, hear!\"\\n\"Well, let\\'s do it.\"\\nTommy laid his paper finally aside. \"There\\'s something of the\\nsimplicity of the truly great mind about you, Tuppence. Fire\\nahead. I\\'m listening.\"\\n\"To begin with,\" said Tuppence, \"what have we to go upon?\"\\n\"Absolutely nothing,\" said Tommy cheerily.\\n\"Wrong!\" Tuppence wagged an energetic finger. \"We have two\\ndistinct clues.\"\\n\"What are they?\"\\n\"First clue, we know one of the gang.\"\\n\"Whittington?\"\\n\"Yes. I\\'d recognize him anywhere.\"\\n\"Hum,\" said Tommy doubtfully, \"I don\\'t call that much of a clue.\\nYou don\\'t know where to look for him, and it\\'s about a thousand\\nto one against your running against him by accident.\"\\n\"I\\'m not so sure about that,\" replied Tuppence thoughtfully.\\n\"I\\'ve often noticed that once coincidences start happening they\\ngo on happening in the most extraordinary way. I dare say it\\'s\\nsome natural law that we haven\\'t found out. Still, as you say, we\\ncan\\'t rely on that. But there ARE places in London where simply\\nevery one is bound to turn up sooner or later. Piccadilly Circus,\\nfor instance. One of my ideas was to take up my stand there\\nevery day with a tray of flags.\"\\n\"What about meals?\" inquired the practical Tommy.\\n\"How like a man! What does mere food matter?\"\\n\"That\\'s all very well. You\\'ve just had a thundering good\\nbreakfast. No one\\'s got a better appetite than you have,\\nTuppence, and by tea-time you\\'d be eating the flags, pins and\\nall. But, honestly, I don\\'t think much of the idea. Whittington\\nmayn\\'t be in London at all.\"\\n\"That\\'s true. Anyway, I think clue No. 2 is more promising.\"\\n\"Let\\'s hear it.\"\\n\"It\\'s nothing much. Only a Christian name--Rita. Whittington\\nmentioned it that day.\"\\n\"Are you proposing a third advertisement: Wanted, female crook,\\nanswering to the name of Rita?\"\\n\"I am not. I propose to reason in a logical manner. That man,\\nDanvers, was shadowed on the way over, wasn\\'t he? And it\\'s more\\nlikely to have been a woman than a man----\"\\n\"I don\\'t see that at all.\"\\n\"I am absolutely certain that it would be a woman, and a\\ngood-looking one,\" replied Tuppence calmly.\\n\"On these technical points I bow to your decision,\" murmured Mr.\\nBeresford.\\n\"Now, obviously this woman, whoever she was, was saved.\"\\n\"How do you make that out?\"\\n\"If she wasn\\'t, how would they have known Jane Finn had got the\\npapers?\"\\n\"Correct. Proceed, O Sherlock!\"\\n\"Now there\\'s just a chance, I admit it\\'s only a chance, that this\\nwoman may have been \\'Rita.\\' \"\\n\"And if so?\"\\n\"If so, we\\'ve got to hunt through the survivors of the Lusitania\\ntill we find her.\"\\n\"Then the first thing is to get a list of the survivors.\"\\n\"I\\'ve got it. I wrote a long list of things I wanted to know,\\nand sent it to Mr. Carter. I got his reply this morning, and\\namong other things it encloses the official statement of those\\nsaved from the Lusitania. How\\'s that for clever little\\nTuppence?\"\\n\"Full marks for industry, zero for modesty. But the great point\\nis, is there a \\'Rita\\' on the list?\"\\n\"That\\'s just what I don\\'t know,\" confessed Tuppence.\\n\"Don\\'t know?\"\\n\"Yes. Look here.\" Together they bent over the list. \"You see,\\nvery few Christian names are given. They\\'re nearly all Mrs. or\\nMiss.\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"That complicates matters,\" he murmured thoughtfully.\\nTuppence gave her characteristic \"terrier\" shake.\\n\"Well, we\\'ve just got to get down to it, that\\'s all. We\\'ll start\\nwith the London area. Just note down the addresses of any of the\\nfemales who live in London or roundabout, while I put on my hat.\"\\nFive minutes later the young couple emerged into Piccadilly, and\\na few seconds later a taxi was bearing them to The Laurels,\\nGlendower Road, N.7, the residence of Mrs. Edgar Keith, whose\\nname figured first in a list of seven reposing in Tommy\\'s\\npocket-book.\\nThe Laurels was a dilapidated house, standing back from the road\\nwith a few grimy bushes to support the fiction of a front garden.\\nTommy paid off the taxi, and accompanied Tuppence to the front\\ndoor bell. As she was about to ring it, he arrested her hand.\\n\"What are you going to say?\"\\n\"What am I going to say? Why, I shall say--Oh dear, I don\\'t\\nknow. It\\'s very awkward.\"\\n\"I thought as much,\" said Tommy with satisfaction. \"How like a\\nwoman! No foresight! Now just stand aside, and see how easily\\nthe mere male deals with the situation.\" He pressed the bell.\\nTuppence withdrew to a suitable spot.\\nA slatternly looking servant, with an extremely dirty face and a\\npair of eyes that did not match, answered the door.\\nTommy had produced a notebook and pencil.\\n\"Good morning,\" he said briskly and cheerfully. \"From the\\nHampstead Borough Council. The new Voting Register. Mrs. Edgar\\nKeith lives here, does she not?\"\\n\"Yaas,\" said the servant.\\n\"Christian name?\" asked Tommy, his pencil poised.\\n\"Missus\\'s? Eleanor Jane.\"\\n\"Eleanor,\" spelt Tommy. \"Any sons or daughters over twenty-one?\"\\n\"Naow.\"\\n\"Thank you.\" Tommy closed the notebook with a brisk snap. \"Good\\nmorning.\"\\nThe servant volunteered her first remark:\\n\"I thought perhaps as you\\'d come about the gas,\" she observed\\ncryptically, and shut the door.\\nTommy rejoined his accomplice.\\n\"You see, Tuppence,\" he observed. \"Child\\'s play to the masculine\\nmind.\"\\n\"I don\\'t mind admitting that for once you\\'ve scored handsomely. I\\nshould never have thought of that.\"\\n\"Good wheeze, wasn\\'t it? And we can repeat it ad lib.\"\\nLunch-time found the young couple attacking a steak and chips in\\nan obscure hostelry with avidity. They had collected a Gladys\\nMary and a Marjorie, been baffled by one change of address, and\\nhad been forced to listen to a long lecture on universal suffrage\\nfrom a vivacious American lady whose Christian name had proved to\\nbe Sadie.\\n\"Ah!\" said Tommy, imbibing a long draught of beer, \"I feel\\nbetter. Where\\'s the next draw?\"\\nThe notebook lay on the table between them. Tuppence picked it\\nup.\\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer,\" she read, \"20 South Audley Mansions. Miss\\nWheeler, 43 Clapington Road, Battersea. She\\'s a lady\\'s maid, as\\nfar as I remember, so probably won\\'t be there, and, anyway, she\\'s\\nnot likely.\"\\n\"Then the Mayfair lady is clearly indicated as the first port of\\ncall.\"\\n\"Tommy, I\\'m getting discouraged.\"\\n\"Buck up, old bean. We always knew it was an outside chance.\\nAnd, anyway, we\\'re only starting. If we draw a blank in London,\\nthere\\'s a fine tour of England, Ireland and Scotland before us.\"\\n\"True,\" said Tuppence, her flagging spirits reviving. \"And all\\nexpenses paid! But, oh, Tommy, I do like things to happen\\nquickly. So far, adventure has succeeded adventure, but this\\nmorning has been dull as dull.\"\\n\"You must stifle this longing for vulgar sensation, Tuppence.\\nRemember that if Mr. Brown is all he is reported to be, it\\'s a\\nwonder that he has not ere now done us to death. That\\'s a good\\nsentence, quite a literary flavour about it.\"\\n\"You\\'re really more conceited than I am--with less excuse! Ahem!\\nBut it certainly is queer that Mr. Brown has not yet wreaked\\nvengeance upon us. (You see, I can do it too.) We pass on our way\\nunscathed.\"\\n\"Perhaps he doesn\\'t think us worth bothering about,\" suggested\\nthe young man simply.\\nTuppence received the remark with great disfavour.\\n\"How horrid you are, Tommy. Just as though we didn\\'t count.\"\\n\"Sorry, Tuppence. What I meant was that we work like moles in\\nthe dark, and that he has no suspicion of our nefarious schemes.\\nHa ha!\"\\n\"Ha ha!\" echoed Tuppence approvingly, as she rose.\\nSouth Audley Mansions was an imposing-looking block of flats just\\noff Park Lane. No. 20 was on the second floor.\\nTommy had by this time the glibness born of practice. He rattled\\noff the formula to the elderly woman, looking more like a\\nhousekeeper than a servant, who opened the door to him.\\n\"Christian name?\"\\n\"Margaret.\"\\nTommy spelt it, but the other interrupted him.\\n\"No, G U E.\"\\n\"Oh, Marguerite; French way, I see.\" He paused, then plunged\\nboldly. \"We had her down as Rita Vandemeyer, but I suppose that\\'s\\nincorrect?\"\\n\"She\\'s mostly called that, sir, but Marguerite\\'s her name.\"\\n\"Thank you. That\\'s all. Good morning.\"\\nHardly able to contain his excitement, Tommy hurried down the\\nstairs. Tuppence was waiting at the angle of the turn.\\n\"You heard?\"\\n\"Yes. Oh, TOMMY!\"\\nTommy squeezed her arm sympathetically.\\n\"I know, old thing. I feel the same.\"\\n\"It\\'s--it\\'s so lovely to think of things--and then for them\\nreally to happen!\" cried Tuppence enthusiastically.\\nHer hand was still in Tommy\\'s. They had reached the entrance\\nhall. There were footsteps on the stairs above them, and voices.\\nSuddenly, to Tommy\\'s complete surprise, Tuppence dragged him into\\nthe little space by the side of the lift where the shadow was\\ndeepest.\\n\"What the----\"\\n\"Hush!\"\\nTwo men came down the stairs and passed out through the entrance.\\nTuppence\\'s hand closed tighter on Tommy\\'s arm.\\n\"Quick--follow them. I daren\\'t. He might recognize me. I don\\'t\\nknow who the other man is, but the bigger of the two was\\nWhittington.\"\\nCHAPTER VII\\nTHE HOUSE IN SOHO\\nWHITTINGTON and his companion were walking at a good pace. Tommy\\nstarted in pursuit at once, and was in time to see them turn the\\ncorner of the street. His vigorous strides soon enabled him to\\ngain upon them, and by the time he, in his turn, reached the\\ncorner the distance between them was sensibly lessened. The small\\nMayfair streets were comparatively deserted, and he judged it\\nwise to content himself with keeping them in sight.\\nThe sport was a new one to him. Though familiar with the\\ntechnicalities from a course of novel reading, he had never\\nbefore attempted to \"follow\" anyone, and it appeared to him at\\nonce that, in actual practice, the proceeding was fraught with\\ndifficulties. Supposing, for instance, that they should suddenly\\nhail a taxi? In books, you simply leapt into another, promised\\nthe driver a sovereign--or its modern equivalent--and there you\\nwere. In actual fact, Tommy foresaw that it was extremely likely\\nthere would be no second taxi. Therefore he would have to run.\\nWhat happened in actual fact to a young man who ran incessantly\\nand persistently through the London streets? In a main road he\\nmight hope to create the illusion that he was merely running for\\na bus. But in these obscure aristocratic byways he could not but\\nfeel that an officious policeman might stop him to explain\\nmatters.\\nAt this juncture in his thoughts a taxi with flag erect turned\\nthe corner of the street ahead. Tommy held his breath. Would\\nthey hail it?\\nHe drew a sigh of relief as they allowed it to pass unchallenged.\\nTheir course was a zigzag one designed to bring them as quickly\\nas possible to Oxford Street. When at length they turned into\\nit, proceeding in an easterly direction, Tommy slightly increased\\nhis pace. Little by little he gained upon them. On the crowded\\npavement there was little chance of his attracting their notice,\\nand he was anxious if possible to catch a word or two of their\\nconversation. In this he was completely foiled; they spoke low\\nand the din of the traffic drowned their voices effectually.\\nJust before the Bond Street Tube station they crossed the road,\\nTommy, unperceived, faithfully at their heels, and entered the\\nbig Lyons\\'. There they went up to the first floor, and sat at a\\nsmall table in the window. It was late, and the place was\\nthinning out. Tommy took a seat at the table next to them,\\nsitting directly behind Whittington in case of recognition. On\\nthe other hand, he had a full view of the second man and studied\\nhim attentively. He was fair, with a weak, unpleasant face, and\\nTommy put him down as being either a Russian or a Pole. He was\\nprobably about fifty years of age, his shoulders cringed a little\\nas he talked, and his eyes, small and crafty, shifted\\nunceasingly.\\nHaving already lunched heartily, Tommy contented himself with\\nordering a Welsh rarebit and a cup of coffee. Whittington\\nordered a substantial lunch for himself and his companion; then,\\nas the waitress withdrew, he moved his chair a little closer to\\nthe table and began to talk earnestly in a low voice. The other\\nman joined in. Listen as he would, Tommy could only catch a word\\nhere and there; but the gist of it seemed to be some directions\\nor orders which the big man was impressing on his companion, and\\nwith which the latter seemed from time to time to disagree.\\nWhittington addressed the other as Boris.\\nTommy caught the word \"Ireland\" several times, also \"propaganda,\"\\nbut of Jane Finn there was no mention. Suddenly, in a lull in\\nthe clatter of the room, he got one phrase entire. Whittington\\nwas speaking. \"Ah, but you don\\'t know Flossie. She\\'s a marvel.\\nAn archbishop would swear she was his own mother. She gets the\\nvoice right every time, and that\\'s really the principal thing.\"\\nTommy did not hear Boris\\'s reply, but in response to it\\nWhittington said something that sounded like: \"Of course--only\\nin an emergency....\"\\nThen he lost the thread again. But presently the phrases became\\ndistinct again whether because the other two had insensibly\\nraised their voices, or because Tommy\\'s ears were getting more\\nattuned, he could not tell. But two words certainly had a most\\nstimulating effect upon the listener. They were uttered by Boris\\nand they were: \"Mr. Brown.\"\\nWhittington seemed to remonstrate with him, but he merely\\nlaughed.\\n\"Why not, my friend? It is a name most respectable--most common.\\nDid he not choose it for that reason? Ah, I should like to meet\\nhim--Mr. Brown.\"\\nThere was a steely ring in Whittington\\'s voice as he replied:\\n\"Who knows? You may have met him already.\"\\n\"Bah!\" retorted the other. \"That is children\\'s talk--a fable for\\nthe police. Do you know what I say to myself sometimes? That he\\nis a fable invented by the Inner Ring, a bogy to frighten us\\nwith. It might be so.\"\\n\"And it might not.\"\\n\"I wonder ... or is it indeed true that he is with us and amongst\\nus, unknown to all but a chosen few? If so, he keeps his secret\\nwell. And the idea is a good one, yes. We never know. We look\\nat each other--ONE OF US IS MR. BROWN--which? He commands--but\\nalso he serves. Among us--in the midst of us. And no one knows\\nwhich he is....\"\\nWith an effort the Russian shook off the vagary of his fancy. He\\nlooked at his watch.\\n\"Yes,\" said Whittington. \"We might as well go.\"\\nHe called the waitress and asked for his bill. Tommy did\\nlikewise, and a few moments later was following the two men down\\nthe stairs.\\nOutside, Whittington hailed a taxi, and directed the driver to go\\nto Waterloo.\\nTaxis were plentiful here, and before Whittington\\'s had driven\\noff another was drawing up to the curb in obedience to Tommy\\'s\\nperemptory hand.\\n\"Follow that other taxi,\" directed the young man. \"Don\\'t lose\\nit.\"\\nThe elderly chauffeur showed no interest. He merely grunted and\\njerked down his flag. The drive was uneventful. Tommy\\'s taxi\\ncame to rest at the departure platform just after Whittington\\'s.\\nTommy was behind him at the booking-office. He took a first-class\\nsingle ticket to Bournemouth, Tommy did the same. As he emerged,\\nBoris remarked, glancing up at the clock: \"You are early. You\\nhave nearly half an hour.\"\\nBoris\\'s words had aroused a new train of thought in Tommy\\'s mind.\\nClearly Whittington was making the journey alone, while the other\\nremained in London. Therefore he was left with a choice as to\\nwhich he would follow. Obviously, he could not follow both of\\nthem unless----Like Boris, he glanced up at the clock, and then\\nto the announcement board of the trains. The Bournemouth train\\nleft at 3.30. It was now ten past. Whittington and Boris were\\nwalking up and down by the bookstall. He gave one doubtful look\\nat them, then hurried into an adjacent telephone box. He dared\\nnot waste time in trying to get hold of Tuppence. In all\\nprobability she was still in the neighbourhood of South Audley\\nMansions. But there remained another ally. He rang up the Ritz\\nand asked for Julius Hersheimmer. There was a click and a buzz.\\nOh, if only the young American was in his room! There was another\\nclick, and then \"Hello\" in unmistakable accents came over the\\nwire.\\n\"That you, Hersheimmer? Beresford speaking. I\\'m at Waterloo.\\nI\\'ve followed Whittington and another man here. No time to\\nexplain. Whittington\\'s off to Bournemouth by the 3.30. Can you\\nget there by then?\"\\nThe reply was reassuring.\\n\"Sure. I\\'ll hustle.\"\\nThe telephone rang off. Tommy put back the receiver with a sigh\\nof relief. His opinion of Julius\\'s power of hustling was high.\\nHe felt instinctively that the American would arrive in time.\\nWhittington and Boris were still where he had left them. If Boris\\nremained to see his friend off, all was well. Then Tommy fingered\\nhis pocket thoughtfully. In spite of the carte blanche assured\\nto him, he had not yet acquired the habit of going about with any\\nconsiderable sum of money on him. The taking of the first-class\\nticket to Bournemouth had left him with only a few shillings in\\nhis pocket. It was to be hoped that Julius would arrive better\\nprovided.\\nIn the meantime, the minutes were creeping by: 3.15, 3.20, 3.25,\\n3.27. Supposing Julius did not get there in time. 3.29.... Doors\\nwere banging. Tommy felt cold waves of despair pass over him.\\nThen a hand fell on his shoulder.\\n\"Here I am, son. Your British traffic beats description! Put me\\nwise to the crooks right away.\"\\n\"That\\'s Whittington--there, getting in now, that big dark man.\\nThe other is the foreign chap he\\'s talking to.\"\\n\"I\\'m on to them. Which of the two is my bird?\"\\nTommy had thought out this question.\\n\"Got any money with you?\"\\nJulius shook his head, and Tommy\\'s face fell.\\n\"I guess I haven\\'t more than three or four hundred dollars with\\nme at the moment,\" explained the American.\\nTommy gave a faint whoop of relief.\\n\"Oh, Lord, you millionaires! You don\\'t talk the same language!\\nClimb aboard the lugger. Here\\'s your ticket. Whittington\\'s your\\nman.\"\\n\"Me for Whittington!\" said Julius darkly. The train was just\\nstarting as he swung himself aboard. \"So long, Tommy.\" The\\ntrain slid out of the station.\\nTommy drew a deep breath. The man Boris was coming along the\\nplatform towards him. Tommy allowed him to pass and then took up\\nthe chase once more.\\nFrom Waterloo Boris took the tube as far as Piccadilly Circus.\\nThen he walked up Shaftesbury Avenue, finally turning off into\\nthe maze of mean streets round Soho. Tommy followed him at a\\njudicious distance.\\nThey reached at length a small dilapidated square. The houses\\nthere had a sinister air in the midst of their dirt and decay.\\nBoris looked round, and Tommy drew back into the shelter of a\\nfriendly porch. The place was almost deserted. It was a\\ncul-de-sac, and consequently no traffic passed that way. The\\nstealthy way the other had looked round stimulated Tommy\\'s\\nimagination. From the shelter of the doorway he watched him go\\nup the steps of a particularly evil-looking house and rap\\nsharply, with a peculiar rhythm, on the door. It was opened\\npromptly, he said a word or two to the doorkeeper, then passed\\ninside. The door was shut to again.\\nIt was at this juncture that Tommy lost his head. What he ought\\nto have done, what any sane man would have done, was to remain\\npatiently where he was and wait for his man to come out again.\\nWhat he did do was entirely foreign to the sober common sense\\nwhich was, as a rule, his leading characteristic. Something, as\\nhe expressed it, seemed to snap in his brain. Without a moment\\'s\\npause for reflection he, too, went up the steps, and reproduced\\nas far as he was able the peculiar knock.\\nThe door swung open with the same promptness as before. A\\nvillainous-faced man with close-cropped hair stood in the\\ndoorway.\\n\"Well?\" he grunted.\\nIt was at that moment that the full realization of his folly\\nbegan to come home to Tommy. But he dared not hesitate. He\\nseized at the first words that came into his mind.\\n\"Mr. Brown?\" he said.\\nTo his surprise the man stood aside.\\n\"Upstairs,\" he said, jerking his thumb over his shoulder, \"second\\ndoor on your left.\"\\nCHAPTER VIII\\nTHE ADVENTURES OF TOMMY\\nTAKEN aback though he was by the man\\'s words, Tommy did not\\nhesitate. If audacity had successfully carried him so far, it was\\nto be hoped it would carry him yet farther. He quietly passed\\ninto the house and mounted the ramshackle staircase. Everything\\nin the house was filthy beyond words. The grimy paper, of a\\npattern now indistinguishable, hung in loose festoons from the\\nwall. In every angle was a grey mass of cobweb.\\nTommy proceeded leisurely. By the time he reached the bend of\\nthe staircase, he had heard the man below disappear into a back\\nroom. Clearly no suspicion attached to him as yet. To come to\\nthe house and ask for \"Mr. Brown\" appeared indeed to be a\\nreasonable and natural proceeding.\\nAt the top of the stairs Tommy halted to consider his next move.\\nIn front of him ran a narrow passage, with doors opening on\\neither side of it. From the one nearest him on the left came a\\nlow murmur of voices. It was this room which he had been\\ndirected to enter. But what held his glance fascinated was a\\nsmall recess immediately on his right, half concealed by a torn\\nvelvet curtain. It was directly opposite the left-handed door\\nand, owing to its angle, it also commanded a good view of the\\nupper part of the staircase. As a hiding-place for one or, at a\\npinch, two men, it was ideal, being about two feet deep and three\\nfeet wide. It attracted Tommy mightily. He thought things over\\nin his usual slow and steady way, deciding that the mention of\\n\"Mr. Brown\" was not a request for an individual, but in all\\nprobability a password used by the gang. His lucky use of it had\\ngained him admission. So far he had aroused no suspicion. But he\\nmust decide quickly on his next step.\\nSuppose he were boldly to enter the room on the left of the\\npassage. Would the mere fact of his having been admitted to the\\nhouse be sufficient? Perhaps a further password would be\\nrequired, or, at any rate, some proof of identity. The\\ndoorkeeper clearly did not know all the members of the gang by\\nsight, but it might be different upstairs. On the whole it seemed\\nto him that luck had served him very well so far, but that there\\nwas such a thing as trusting it too far. To enter that room was a\\ncolossal risk. He could not hope to sustain his part\\nindefinitely; sooner or later he was almost bound to betray\\nhimself, and then he would have thrown away a vital chance in\\nmere foolhardiness.\\nA repetition of the signal knock sounded on the door below, and\\nTommy, his mind made up, slipped quickly into the recess, and\\ncautiously drew the curtain farther across so that it shielded\\nhim completely from sight. There were several rents and slits in\\nthe ancient material which afforded him a good view. He would\\nwatch events, and any time he chose could, after all, join the\\nassembly, modelling his behaviour on that of the new arrival.\\nThe man who came up the staircase with a furtive, soft-footed\\ntread was quite unknown to Tommy. He was obviously of the very\\ndregs of society. The low beetling brows, and the criminal jaw,\\nthe bestiality of the whole countenance were new to the young\\nman, though he was a type that Scotland Yard would have\\nrecognized at a glance.\\nThe man passed the recess, breathing heavily as he went. He\\nstopped at the door opposite, and gave a repetition of the signal\\nknock. A voice inside called out something, and the man opened\\nthe door and passed in, affording Tommy a momentary glimpse of\\nthe room inside. He thought there must be about four or five\\npeople seated round a long table that took up most of the space,\\nbut his attention was caught and held by a tall man with\\nclose-cropped hair and a short, pointed, naval-looking beard, who\\nsat at the head of the table with papers in front of him. As the\\nnew-comer entered he glanced up, and with a correct, but\\ncuriously precise enunciation, which attracted Tommy\\'s notice, he\\nasked:\\n\"Your number, comrade?\"\\n\"Fourteen, gov\\'nor,\" replied the other hoarsely.\\n\"Correct.\"\\nThe door shut again.\\n\"If that isn\\'t a Hun, I\\'m a Dutchman!\" said Tommy to himself.\\n\"And running the show darned systematically too--as they always\\ndo. Lucky I didn\\'t roll in. I\\'d have given the wrong number, and\\nthere would have been the deuce to pay. No, this is the place\\nfor me. Hullo, here\\'s another knock.\"\\nThis visitor proved to be of an entirely different type to the\\nlast. Tommy recognized in him an Irish Sinn Feiner. Certainly\\nMr. Brown\\'s organization was a far-reaching concern. The common\\ncriminal, the well-bred Irish gentleman, the pale Russian, and\\nthe efficient German master of the ceremonies! Truly a strange\\nand sinister gathering! Who was this man who held in his finger\\nthese curiously variegated links of an unknown chain?\\nIn this case, the procedure was exactly the same. The signal\\nknock, the demand for a number, and the reply \"Correct.\"\\nTwo knocks followed in quick succession on the door below. The\\nfirst man was quite unknown to Tommy, who put him down as a city\\nclerk. A quiet, intelligent-looking man, rather shabbily dressed.\\nThe second was of the working classes, and his face was vaguely\\nfamiliar to the young man.\\nThree minutes later came another, a man of commanding appearance,\\nexquisitely dressed, and evidently well born. His face, again,\\nwas not unknown to the watcher, though he could not for the\\nmoment put a name to it.\\nAfter his arrival there was a long wait. In fact Tommy concluded\\nthat the gathering was now complete, and was just cautiously\\ncreeping out from his hiding-place, when another knock sent him\\nscuttling back to cover.\\nThis last-comer came up the stairs so quietly that he was almost\\nabreast of Tommy before the young man had realized his presence.\\nHe was a small man, very pale, with a gentle almost womanish air.\\nThe angle of the cheek-bones hinted at his Slavonic ancestry,\\notherwise there was nothing to indicate his nationality. As he\\npassed the recess, he turned his head slowly. The strange light\\neyes seemed to burn through the curtain; Tommy could hardly\\nbelieve that the man did not know he was there and in spite of\\nhimself he shivered. He was no more fanciful than the majority of\\nyoung Englishmen, but he could not rid himself of the impression\\nthat some unusually potent force emanated from the man. The\\ncreature reminded him of a venomous snake.\\nA moment later his impression was proved correct. The new-comer\\nknocked on the door as all had done, but his reception was very\\ndifferent. The bearded man rose to his feet, and all the others\\nfollowed suit. The German came forward and shook hands. His\\nheels clicked together.\\n\"We are honoured,\" he said. \"We are greatly honoured. I much\\nfeared that it would be impossible.\"\\nThe other answered in a low voice that had a kind of hiss in it:\\n\"There were difficulties. It will not be possible again, I fear.\\nBut one meeting is essential--to define my policy. I can do\\nnothing without--Mr. Brown. He is here?\"\\nThe change in the German\\'s voice was audible as he replied with\\nslight hesitation:\\n\"We have received a message. It is impossible for him to be\\npresent in person.\" He stopped, giving a curious impression of\\nhaving left the sentence unfinished.\\nA very slow smile overspread the face of the other. He looked\\nround at a circle of uneasy faces.\\n\"Ah! I understand. I have read of his methods. He works in the\\ndark and trusts no one. But, all the same, it is possible that\\nhe is among us now....\" He looked round him again, and again that\\nexpression of fear swept over the group. Each man seemed eyeing\\nhis neighbour doubtfully.\\nThe Russian tapped his cheek.\\n\"So be it. Let us proceed.\"\\nThe German seemed to pull himself together. He indicated the\\nplace he had been occupying at the head of the table. The Russian\\ndemurred, but the other insisted.\\n\"It is the only possible place,\" he said, \"for--Number One.\\nPerhaps Number Fourteen will shut the door?\"\\nIn another moment Tommy was once more confronting bare wooden\\npanels, and the voices within had sunk once more to a mere\\nundistinguishable murmur. Tommy became restive. The conversation\\nhe had overheard had stimulated his curiosity. He felt that, by\\nhook or by crook, he must hear more.\\nThere was no sound from below, and it did not seem likely that\\nthe doorkeeper would come upstairs. After listening intently for\\na minute or two, he put his head round the curtain. The passage\\nwas deserted. Tommy bent down and removed his shoes, then,\\nleaving them behind the curtain, he walked gingerly out on his\\nstockinged feet, and kneeling down by the closed door he laid his\\near cautiously to the crack. To his intense annoyance he could\\ndistinguish little more; just a chance word here and there if a\\nvoice was raised, which merely served to whet his curiosity still\\nfarther.\\nHe eyed the handle of the door tentatively. Could he turn it by\\ndegrees so gently and imperceptibly that those in the room would\\nnotice nothing? He decided that with great care it could be\\ndone. Very slowly, a fraction of an inch at a time, he moved it\\nround, holding his breath in his excessive care. A little more--a\\nlittle more still--would it never be finished? Ah! at last it\\nwould turn no farther.\\nHe stayed so for a minute or two, then drew a deep breath, and\\npressed it ever so slightly inward. The door did not budge.\\nTommy was annoyed. If he had to use too much force, it would\\nalmost certainly creak. He waited until the voices rose a little,\\nthen he tried again. Still nothing happened. He increased the\\npressure. Had the beastly thing stuck? Finally, in desperation,\\nhe pushed with all his might. But the door remained firm, and at\\nlast the truth dawned upon him. It was locked or bolted on the\\ninside.\\nFor a moment or two Tommy\\'s indignation got the better of him.\\n\"Well, I\\'m damned!\" he said. \"What a dirty trick!\"\\nAs his indignation cooled, he prepared to face the situation.\\nClearly the first thing to be done was to restore the handle to\\nits original position. If he let it go suddenly, the men inside\\nwould be almost certain to notice it, so, with the same infinite\\npains, he reversed his former tactics. All went well, and with a\\nsigh of relief the young man rose to his feet. There was a\\ncertain bulldog tenacity about Tommy that made him slow to admit\\ndefeat. Checkmated for the moment, he was far from abandoning the\\nconflict. He still intended to hear what was going on in the\\nlocked room. As one plan had failed, he must hunt about for\\nanother.\\nHe looked round him. A little farther along the passage on the\\nleft was a second door. He slipped silently along to it. He\\nlistened for a moment or two, then tried the handle. It yielded,\\nand he slipped inside.\\nThe room, which was untenanted, was furnished as a bedroom. Like\\neverything else in the house, the furniture was falling to\\npieces, and the dirt was, if anything, more abundant.\\nBut what interested Tommy was the thing he had hoped to find, a\\ncommunicating door between the two rooms, up on the left by the\\nwindow. Carefully closing the door into the passage behind him,\\nhe stepped across to the other and examined it closely. The bolt\\nwas shot across it. It was very rusty, and had clearly not been\\nused for some time. By gently wriggling it to and fro, Tommy\\nmanaged to draw it back without making too much noise. Then he\\nrepeated his former manoeuvres with the handle--this time with\\ncomplete success. The door swung open--a crack, a mere fraction,\\nbut enough for Tommy to hear what went on. There was a velvet\\nportiere on the inside of this door which prevented him from\\nseeing, but he was able to recognize the voices with a reasonable\\namount of accuracy.\\nThe Sinn Feiner was speaking. His rich Irish voice was\\nunmistakable:\\n\"That\\'s all very well. But more money is essential. No money--no\\nresults!\"\\nAnother voice which Tommy rather thought was that of Boris\\nreplied:\\n\"Will you guarantee that there ARE results?\"\\n\"In a month from now--sooner or later as you wish--I will\\nguarantee you such a reign of terror in Ireland as shall shake\\nthe British Empire to its foundations.\"\\nThere was a pause, and then came the soft, sibilant accents of\\nNumber One:\\n\"Good! You shall have the money. Boris, you will see to that.\"\\nBoris asked a question:\\n\"Via the Irish Americans, and Mr. Potter as usual?\"\\n\"I guess that\\'ll be all right!\" said a new voice, with a\\ntransatlantic intonation, \"though I\\'d like to point out, here and\\nnow, that things are getting a mite difficult. There\\'s not the\\nsympathy there was, and a growing disposition to let the Irish\\nsettle their own affairs without interference from America.\"\\nTommy felt that Boris had shrugged his shoulders as he answered:\\n\"Does that matter, since the money only nominally comes from the\\nStates?\"\\n\"The chief difficulty is the landing of the ammunition,\" said the\\nSinn Feiner. \"The money is conveyed in easily enough--thanks to\\nour colleague here.\"\\nAnother voice, which Tommy fancied was that of the tall,\\ncommanding-looking man whose face had seemed familiar to him,\\nsaid:\\n\"Think of the feelings of Belfast if they could hear you!\"\\n\"That is settled, then,\" said the sibilant tones. \"Now, in the\\nmatter of the loan to an English newspaper, you have arranged the\\ndetails satisfactorily, Boris?\"\\n\"I think so.\"\\n\"That is good. An official denial from Moscow will be\\nforthcoming if necessary.\"\\nThere was a pause, and then the clear voice of the German broke\\nthe silence:\\n\"I am directed by--Mr. Brown, to place the summaries of the\\nreports from the different unions before you. That of the miners\\nis most satisfactory. We must hold back the railways. There may\\nbe trouble with the A.S.E.\"\\nFor a long time there was a silence, broken only by the rustle of\\npapers and an occasional word of explanation from the German.\\nThen Tommy heard the light tap-tap of fingers, drumming on the\\ntable.\\n\"And--the date, my friend?\" said Number One.\\n\"The 29th.\"\\nThe Russian seemed to consider:\\n\"That is rather soon.\"\\n\"I know. But it was settled by the principal Labour leaders, and\\nwe cannot seem to interfere too much. They must believe it to be\\nentirely their own show.\"\\nThe Russian laughed softly, as though amused.\\n\"Yes, yes,\" he said. \"That is true. They must have no inkling\\nthat we are using them for our own ends. They are honest\\nmen--and that is their value to us. It is curious--but you\\ncannot make a revolution without honest men. The instinct of the\\npopulace is infallible.\" He paused, and then repeated, as though\\nthe phrase pleased him: \"Every revolution has had its honest\\nmen. They are soon disposed of afterwards.\"\\nThere was a sinister note in his voice.\\nThe German resumed:\\n\"Clymes must go. He is too far-seeing. Number Fourteen will see\\nto that.\"\\nThere was a hoarse murmur.\\n\"That\\'s all right, gov\\'nor.\" And then after a moment or two:\\n\"Suppose I\\'m nabbed.\"\\n\"You will have the best legal talent to defend you,\" replied the\\nGerman quietly. \"But in any case you will wear gloves fitted\\nwith the finger-prints of a notorious housebreaker. You have\\nlittle to fear.\"\\n\"Oh, I ain\\'t afraid, gov\\'nor. All for the good of the cause. The\\nstreets is going to run with blood, so they say.\" He spoke with a\\ngrim relish. \"Dreams of it, sometimes, I does. And diamonds and\\npearls rolling about in the gutter for anyone to pick up!\"\\nTommy heard a chair shifted. Then Number One spoke:\\n\"Then all is arranged. We are assured of success?\"\\n\"I--think so.\" But the German spoke with less than his usual\\nconfidence.\\nNumber One\\'s voice held suddenly a dangerous quality:\\n\"What has gone wrong?\"\\n\"Nothing; but----\"\\n\"But what?\"\\n\"The Labour leaders. Without them, as you say, we can do\\nnothing. If they do not declare a general strike on the 29th----\"\\n\"Why should they not?\"\\n\"As you\\'ve said, they\\'re honest. And, in spite of everything\\nwe\\'ve done to discredit the Government in their eyes, I\\'m not\\nsure that they haven\\'t got a sneaking faith and belief in it.\"\\n\"But----\"\\n\"I know. They abuse it unceasingly. But, on the whole, public\\nopinion swings to the side of the Government. They will not go\\nagainst it.\"\\nAgain the Russian\\'s fingers drummed on the table.\\n\"To the point, my friend. I was given to understand that there\\nwas a certain document in existence which assured success.\"\\n\"That is so. If that document were placed before the leaders,\\nthe result would be immediate. They would publish it broadcast\\nthroughout England, and declare for the revolution without a\\nmoment\\'s hesitation. The Government would be broken finally and\\ncompletely.\"\\n\"Then what more do you want?\"\\n\"The document itself,\" said the German bluntly.\\n\"Ah! It is not in your possession? But you know where it is?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"Does anyone know where it is?\"\\n\"One person--perhaps. And we are not sure of that even.\"\\n\"Who is this person?\"\\n\"A girl.\"\\nTommy held his breath.\\n\"A girl?\" The Russian\\'s voice rose contemptuously. \"And you have\\nnot made her speak? In Russia we have ways of making a girl\\ntalk.\"\\n\"This case is different,\" said the German sullenly.\\n\"How--different?\" He paused a moment, then went on: \"Where is\\nthe girl now?\"\\n\"The girl?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"She is----\"\\nBut Tommy heard no more. A crashing blow descended on his head,\\nand all was darkness.\\nCHAPTER IX\\nTUPPENCE ENTERS DOMESTIC SERVICE\\nWHEN Tommy set forth on the trail of the two men, it took all\\nTuppence\\'s self-command to refrain from accompanying him.\\nHowever, she contained herself as best she might, consoled by the\\nreflection that her reasoning had been justified by events. The\\ntwo men had undoubtedly come from the second floor flat, and that\\none slender thread of the name \"Rita\" had set the Young\\nAdventurers once more upon the track of the abductors of Jane\\nFinn.\\nThe question was what to do next? Tuppence hated letting the\\ngrass grow under her feet. Tommy was amply employed, and\\ndebarred from joining him in the chase, the girl felt at a loose\\nend. She retraced her steps to the entrance hall of the mansions.\\nIt was now tenanted by a small lift-boy, who was polishing brass\\nfittings, and whistling the latest air with a good deal of vigour\\nand a reasonable amount of accuracy.\\nHe glanced round at Tuppence\\'s entry. There was a certain amount\\nof the gamin element in the girl, at all events she invariably\\ngot on well with small boys. A sympathetic bond seemed instantly\\nto be formed. She reflected that an ally in the enemy\\'s camp, so\\nto speak, was not to be despised.\\n\"Well, William,\" she remarked cheerfully, in the best approved\\nhospital-early-morning style, \"getting a good shine up?\"\\nThe boy grinned responsively.\\n\"Albert, miss,\" he corrected.\\n\"Albert be it,\" said Tuppence. She glanced mysteriously round\\nthe hall. The effect was purposely a broad one in case Albert\\nshould miss it. She leaned towards the boy and dropped her voice:\\n\"I want a word with you, Albert.\"\\nAlbert ceased operations on the fittings and opened his mouth\\nslightly.\\n\"Look! Do you know what this is?\" With a dramatic gesture she\\nflung back the left side of her coat and exposed a small\\nenamelled badge. It was extremely unlikely that Albert would have\\nany knowledge of it--indeed, it would have been fatal for\\nTuppence\\'s plans, since the badge in question was the device of a\\nlocal training corps originated by the archdeacon in the early\\ndays of the war. Its presence in Tuppence\\'s coat was due to the\\nfact that she had used it for pinning in some flowers a day or\\ntwo before. But Tuppence had sharp eyes, and had noted the corner\\nof a threepenny detective novel protruding from Albert\\'s pocket,\\nand the immediate enlargement of his eyes told her that her\\ntactics were good, and that the fish would rise to the bait.\\n\"American Detective Force!\" she hissed.\\nAlbert fell for it.\\n\"Lord!\" he murmured ecstatically.\\nTuppence nodded at him with the air of one who has established a\\nthorough understanding.\\n\"Know who I\\'m after?\" she inquired genially.\\nAlbert, still round-eyed, demanded breathlessly:\\n\"One of the flats?\"\\nTuppence nodded and jerked a thumb up the stairs.\\n\"No. 20. Calls herself Vandemeyer. Vandemeyer! Ha! ha!\"\\nAlbert\\'s hand stole to his pocket.\\n\"A crook?\" he queried eagerly.\\n\"A crook? I should say so. Ready Rita they call her in the\\nStates.\"\\n\"Ready Rita,\" repeated Albert deliriously. \"Oh, ain\\'t it just\\nlike the pictures!\"\\nIt was. Tuppence was a great frequenter of the kinema.\\n\"Annie always said as how she was a bad lot,\" continued the boy.\\n\"Who\\'s Annie?\" inquired Tuppence idly.\\n\" \\'Ouse-parlourmaid. She\\'s leaving to-day. Many\\'s the time\\nAnnie\\'s said to me: \\'Mark my words, Albert, I wouldn\\'t wonder if\\nthe police was to come after her one of these days.\\' dust like\\nthat. But she\\'s a stunner to look at, ain\\'t she?\"\\n\"She\\'s some peach,\" allowed Tuppence carelessly. \"Finds it\\nuseful in her lay-out, you bet. Has she been wearing any of the\\nemeralds, by the way?\"\\n\"Emeralds? Them\\'s the green stones, isn\\'t they?\"\\nTuppence nodded.\\n\"That\\'s what we\\'re after her for. You know old man Rysdale?\"\\nAlbert shook his head.\\n\"Peter B. Rysdale, the oil king?\"\\n\"It seems sort of familiar to me.\"\\n\"The sparklers belonged to him. Finest collection of emeralds in\\nthe world. Worth a million dollars!\"\\n\"Lumme!\" came ecstatically from Albert. \"It sounds more like the\\npictures every minute.\"\\nTuppence smiled, gratified at the success of her efforts.\\n\"We haven\\'t exactly proved it yet. But we\\'re after her.\\nAnd\"--she produced a long-drawn-out wink--\"I guess she won\\'t get\\naway with the goods this time.\"\\nAlbert uttered another ejaculation indicative of delight.\\n\"Mind you, sonny, not a word of this,\" said Tuppence suddenly. \"I\\nguess I oughtn\\'t to have put you wise, but in the States we know\\na real smart lad when we see one.\"\\n\"I\\'ll not breathe a word,\" protested Albert eagerly. \"Ain\\'t there\\nanything I could do? A bit of shadowing, maybe, or such like?\"\\nTuppence affected to consider, then shook her head.\\n\"Not at the moment, but I\\'ll bear you in mind, son. What\\'s this\\nabout the girl you say is leaving?\"\\n\"Annie? Regular turn up, they \\'ad. As Annie said, servants is\\nsome one nowadays, and to be treated accordingly, and, what with\\nher passing the word round, she won\\'t find it so easy to get\\nanother.\"\\n\"Won\\'t she?\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. \"I wonder----\"\\nAn idea was dawning in her brain. She thought a minute or two,\\nthen tapped Albert on the shoulder.\\n\"See here, son, my brain\\'s got busy. How would it be if you\\nmentioned that you\\'d got a young cousin, or a friend of yours\\nhad, that might suit the place. You get me?\"\\n\"I\\'m there,\" said Albert instantly. \"You leave it to me, miss,\\nand I\\'ll fix the whole thing up in two ticks.\"\\n\"Some lad!\" commented Tuppence, with a nod of approval. \"You\\nmight say that the young woman could come in right away. You let\\nme know, and if it\\'s O.K. I\\'ll be round to-morrow at eleven\\no\\'clock.\"\\n\"Where am I to let you know to?\"\\n\"Ritz,\" replied Tuppence laconically. \"Name of Cowley.\"\\nAlbert eyed her enviously.\\n\"It must be a good job, this tec business.\"\\n\"It sure is,\" drawled Tuppence, \"especially when old man Rysdale\\nbacks the bill. But don\\'t fret, son. If this goes well, you\\nshall come in on the ground floor.\"\\nWith which promise she took leave of her new ally, and walked\\nbriskly away from South Audley Mansions, well pleased with her\\nmorning\\'s work.\\nBut there was no time to be lost. She went straight back to the\\nRitz and wrote a few brief words to Mr. Carter. Having\\ndispatched this, and Tommy not having yet returned--which did not\\nsurprise her--she started off on a shopping expedition which,\\nwith an interval for tea and assorted creamy cakes, occupied her\\nuntil well after six o\\'clock, and she returned to the hotel\\njaded, but satisfied with her purchases. Starting with a cheap\\nclothing store, and passing through one or two second-hand\\nestablishments, she had finished the day at a well-known\\nhairdresser\\'s. Now, in the seclusion of her bedroom, she\\nunwrapped that final purchase. Five minutes later she smiled\\ncontentedly at her reflection in the glass. With an actress\\'s\\npencil she had slightly altered the line of her eyebrows, and\\nthat, taken in conjunction with the new luxuriant growth of fair\\nhair above, so changed her appearance that she felt confident\\nthat even if she came face to face with Whittington he would not\\nrecognize her. She would wear elevators in her shoes, and the\\ncap and apron would be an even more valuable disguise. From\\nhospital experience she knew only too well that a nurse out of\\nuniform is frequently unrecognized by her patients.\\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence aloud, nodding at the pert reflection in the\\nglass, \"you\\'ll do.\" She then resumed her normal appearance.\\nDinner was a solitary meal. Tuppence was rather surprised at\\nTommy\\'s non-return. Julius, too, was absent--but that to the\\ngirl\\'s mind was more easily explained. His \"hustling\" activities\\nwere not confined to London, and his abrupt appearances and\\ndisappearances were fully accepted by the Young Adventurers as\\npart of the day\\'s work. It was quite on the cards that Julius P.\\nHersheimmer had left for Constantinople at a moment\\'s notice if\\nhe fancied that a clue to his cousin\\'s disappearance was to be\\nfound there. The energetic young man had succeeded in making the\\nlives of several Scotland Yard men unbearable to them, and the\\ntelephone girls at the Admiralty had learned to know and dread\\nthe familiar \"Hullo!\" He had spent three hours in Paris hustling\\nthe Prefecture, and had returned from there imbued with the idea,\\npossibly inspired by a weary French official, that the true clue\\nto the mystery was to be found in Ireland.\\n\"I dare say he\\'s dashed off there now,\" thought Tuppence. \"All\\nvery well, but this is very dull for ME! Here I am bursting with\\nnews, and absolutely no one to tell it to! Tommy might have\\nwired, or something. I wonder where he is. Anyway, he can\\'t have\\n\\'lost the trail\\' as they say. That reminds me----\" And Miss\\nCowley broke off in her meditations, and summoned a small boy.\\nTen minutes later the lady was ensconced comfortably on her bed,\\nsmoking cigarettes and deep in the perusal of Garnaby Williams,\\nthe Boy Detective, which, with other threepenny works of lurid\\nfiction, she had sent out to purchase. She felt, and rightly,\\nthat before the strain of attempting further intercourse with\\nAlbert, it would be as well to fortify herself with a good supply\\nof local colour.\\nThe morning brought a note from Mr. Carter:\\n\"DEAR MISS TUPPENCE,\\n\"You have made a splendid start, and I congratulate you. I feel,\\nthough, that I should like to point out to you once more the\\nrisks you are running, especially if you pursue the course you\\nindicate. Those people are absolutely desperate and incapable of\\neither mercy or pity. I feel that you probably underestimate the\\ndanger, and therefore warn you again that I can promise you no\\nprotection. You have given us valuable information, and if you\\nchoose to withdraw now no one could blame you. At any rate,\\nthink the matter over well before you decide.\\n\"If, in spite of my warnings, you make up your mind to go through\\nwith it, you will find everything arranged. You have lived for\\ntwo years with Miss Dufferin, The Parsonage, Llanelly, and Mrs.\\nVandemeyer can apply to her for a reference.\\n\"May I be permitted a word or two of advice? Stick as near to\\nthe truth as possible--it minimizes the danger of \\'slips.\\' I\\nsuggest that you should represent yourself to be what you are, a\\nformer V.A.D., who has chosen domestic service as a profession.\\nThere are many such at the present time. That explains away any\\nincongruities of voice or manner which otherwise might awaken\\nsuspicion.\\n\"Whichever way you decide, good luck to you.\\n\"Your sincere friend, \"MR. CARTER.\"\\nTuppence\\'s spirits rose mercurially. Mr. Carter\\'s warnings\\npassed unheeded. The young lady had far too much confidence in\\nherself to pay any heed to them.\\nWith some reluctance she abandoned the interesting part she had\\nsketched out for herself. Although she had no doubts of her own\\npowers to sustain a role indefinitely, she had too much common\\nsense not to recognize the force of Mr. Carter\\'s arguments.\\nThere was still no word or message from Tommy, but the morning\\npost brought a somewhat dirty postcard with the words: \"It\\'s\\nO.K.\" scrawled upon it.\\nAt ten-thirty Tuppence surveyed with pride a slightly battered\\ntin trunk containing her new possessions. It was artistically\\ncorded. It was with a slight blush that she rang the bell and\\nordered it to be placed in a taxi. She drove to Paddington, and\\nleft the box in the cloak room. She then repaired with a handbag\\nto the fastnesses of the ladies\\' waiting-room. Ten minutes later\\na metamorphosed Tuppence walked demurely out of the station and\\nentered a bus.\\nIt was a few minutes past eleven when Tuppence again entered the\\nhall of South Audley Mansions. Albert was on the look-out,\\nattending to his duties in a somewhat desultory fashion. He did\\nnot immediately recognize Tuppence. When he did, his admiration\\nwas unbounded.\\n\"Blest if I\\'d have known you! That rig-out\\'s top-hole.\"\\n\"Glad you like it, Albert,\" replied Tuppence modestly. \"By the\\nway, am I your cousin, or am I not?\"\\n\"Your voice too,\" cried the delighted boy. \"It\\'s as English as\\nanything! No, I said as a friend of mine knew a young gal. Annie\\nwasn\\'t best pleased. She\\'s stopped on till to-day--to oblige, SHE\\nsaid, but really it\\'s so as to put you against the place.\"\\n\"Nice girl,\" said Tuppence.\\nAlbert suspected no irony.\\n\"She\\'s style about her, and keeps her silver a treat--but, my\\nword, ain\\'t she got a temper. Are you going up now, miss? Step\\ninside the lift. No. 20 did you say?\" And he winked.\\nTuppence quelled him with a stern glance, and stepped inside.\\nAs she rang the bell of No. 20 she was conscious of Albert\\'s eyes\\nslowly descending beneath the level of the floor.\\nA smart young woman opened the door.\\n\"I\\'ve come about the place,\" said Tuppence.\\n\"It\\'s a rotten place,\" said the young woman without hesitation.\\n\"Regular old cat--always interfering. Accused me of tampering\\nwith her letters. Me! The flap was half undone anyway. There\\'s\\nnever anything in the waste-paper basket--she burns everything.\\nShe\\'s a wrong \\'un, that\\'s what she is. Swell clothes, but no\\nclass. Cook knows something about her--but she won\\'t\\ntell--scared to death of her. And suspicious! She\\'s on to you in\\na minute if you as much as speak to a fellow. I can tell you----\"\\nBut what more Annie could tell, Tuppence was never destined to\\nlearn, for at that moment a clear voice with a peculiarly steely\\nring to it called:\\n\"Annie!\"\\nThe smart young woman jumped as if she had been shot.\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am.\"\\n\"Who are you talking to?\"\\n\"It\\'s a young woman about the situation, ma\\'am.\"\\n\"Show her in then. At once.\"\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am.\"\\nTuppence was ushered into a room on the right of the long\\npassage. A woman was standing by the fireplace. She was no\\nlonger in her first youth, and the beauty she undeniably\\npossessed was hardened and coarsened. In her youth she must have\\nbeen dazzling. Her pale gold hair, owing a slight assistance to\\nart, was coiled low on her neck, her eyes, of a piercing electric\\nblue, seemed to possess a faculty of boring into the very soul of\\nthe person she was looking at. Her exquisite figure was enhanced\\nby a wonderful gown of indigo charmeuse. And yet, despite her\\nswaying grace, and the almost ethereal beauty of her face, you\\nfelt instinctively the presence of something hard and menacing, a\\nkind of metallic strength that found expression in the tones of\\nher voice and in that gimletlike quality of her eyes.\\nFor the first time Tuppence felt afraid. She had not feared\\nWhittington, but this woman was different. As if fascinated, she\\nwatched the long cruel line of the red curving mouth, and again\\nshe felt that sensation of panic pass over her. Her usual\\nself-confidence deserted her. Vaguely she felt that deceiving\\nthis woman would be very different to deceiving Whittington. Mr.\\nCarter\\'s warning recurred to her mind. Here, indeed, she might\\nexpect no mercy.\\nFighting down that instinct of panic which urged her to turn tail\\nand run without further delay, Tuppence returned the lady\\'s gaze\\nfirmly and respectfully.\\nAs though that first scrutiny had been satisfactory, Mrs.\\nVandemeyer motioned to a chair.\\n\"You can sit down. How did you hear I wanted a\\nhouse-parlourmaid?\"\\n\"Through a friend who knows the lift boy here. He thought the\\nplace might suit me.\"\\nAgain that basilisk glance seemed to pierce her through.\\n\"You speak like an educated girl?\"\\nGlibly enough, Tuppence ran through her imaginary career on the\\nlines suggested by Mr. Carter. It seemed to her, as she did so,\\nthat the tension of Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s attitude relaxed.\\n\"I see,\" she remarked at length. \"Is there anyone I can write to\\nfor a reference?\"\\n\"I lived last with a Miss Dufferin, The Parsonage, Llanelly. I\\nwas with her two years.\"\\n\"And then you thought you would get more money by coming to\\nLondon, I suppose? Well, it doesn\\'t matter to me. I will give\\nyou L50--L60--whatever you want. You can come in at once?\"\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am. To-day, if you like. My box is at Paddington.\"\\n\"Go and fetch it in a taxi, then. It\\'s an easy place. I am out\\na good deal. By the way, what\\'s your name?\"\\n\"Prudence Cooper, ma\\'am.\"\\n\"Very well, Prudence. Go away and fetch your box. I shall be\\nout to lunch. The cook will show you where everything is.\"\\n\"Thank you, ma\\'am.\"\\nTuppence withdrew. The smart Annie was not in evidence. In the\\nhall below a magnificent hall porter had relegated Albert to the\\nbackground. Tuppence did not even glance at him as she passed\\nmeekly out.\\nThe adventure had begun, but she felt less elated than she had\\ndone earlier in the morning. It crossed her mind that if the\\nunknown Jane Finn had fallen into the hands of Mrs. Vandemeyer,\\nit was likely to have gone hard with her.\\nCHAPTER X\\nENTER SIR JAMES PEEL EDGERTON\\nTUPPENCE betrayed no awkwardness in her new duties. The daughters\\nof the archdeacon were well grounded in household tasks. They\\nwere also experts in training a \"raw girl,\" the inevitable result\\nbeing that the raw girl, once trained, departed elsewhere where\\nher newly acquired knowledge commanded a more substantial\\nremuneration than the archdeacon\\'s meagre purse allowed.\\nTuppence had therefore very little fear of proving inefficient.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s cook puzzled her. She evidently went in deadly\\nterror of her mistress. The girl thought it probable that the\\nother woman had some hold over her. For the rest, she cooked\\nlike a chef, as Tuppence had an opportunity of judging that\\nevening. Mrs. Vandemeyer was expecting a guest to dinner, and\\nTuppence accordingly laid the beautifully polished table for two.\\nShe was a little exercised in her own mind as to this visitor. It\\nwas highly possible that it might prove to be Whittington.\\nAlthough she felt fairly confident that he would not recognize\\nher, yet she would have been better pleased had the guest proved\\nto be a total stranger. However, there was nothing for it but to\\nhope for the best.\\nAt a few minutes past eight the front door bell rang, and\\nTuppence went to answer it with some inward trepidation. She was\\nrelieved to see that the visitor was the second of the two men\\nwhom Tommy had taken upon himself to follow.\\nHe gave his name as Count Stepanov. Tuppence announced him, and\\nMrs. Vandemeyer rose from her seat on a low divan with a quick\\nmurmur of pleasure.\\n\"It is delightful to see you, Boris Ivanovitch,\" she said.\\n\"And you, madame!\" He bowed low over her hand.\\nTuppence returned to the kitchen.\\n\"Count Stepanov, or some such,\" she remarked, and affecting a\\nfrank and unvarnished curiosity: \"Who\\'s he?\"\\n\"A Russian gentleman, I believe.\"\\n\"Come here much?\"\\n\"Once in a while. What d\\'you want to know for?\"\\n\"Fancied he might be sweet on the missus, that\\'s all,\" explained\\nthe girl, adding with an appearance of sulkiness: \"How you do\\ntake one up!\"\\n\"I\\'m not quite easy in my mind about the souffle,\" explained the\\nother.\\n\"You know something,\" thought Tuppence to herself, but aloud she\\nonly said: \"Going to dish up now? Right-o.\"\\nWhilst waiting at table, Tuppence listened closely to all that\\nwas said. She remembered that this was one of the men Tommy was\\nshadowing when she had last seen him. Already, although she\\nwould hardly admit it, she was becoming uneasy about her partner.\\nWhere was he? Why had no word of any kind come from him? She had\\narranged before leaving the Ritz to have all letters or messages\\nsent on at once by special messenger to a small stationer\\'s shop\\nnear at hand where Albert was to call in frequently. True, it was\\nonly yesterday morning that she had parted from Tommy, and she\\ntold herself that any anxiety on his behalf would be absurd.\\nStill, it was strange that he had sent no word of any kind.\\nBut, listen as she might, the conversation presented no clue.\\nBoris and Mrs. Vandemeyer talked on purely indifferent subjects:\\nplays they had seen, new dances, and the latest society gossip.\\nAfter dinner they repaired to the small boudoir where Mrs.\\nVandemeyer, stretched on the divan, looked more wickedly\\nbeautiful than ever. Tuppence brought in the coffee and liqueurs\\nand unwillingly retired. As she did so, she heard Boris say:\\n\"New, isn\\'t she?\"\\n\"She came in to-day. The other was a fiend. This girl seems all\\nright. She waits well.\"\\nTuppence lingered a moment longer by the door which she had\\ncarefully neglected to close, and heard him say:\\n\"Quite safe, I suppose?\"\\n\"Really, Boris, you are absurdly suspicious. I believe she\\'s the\\ncousin of the hall porter, or something of the kind. And nobody\\neven dreams that I have any connection with our--mutual friend,\\nMr. Brown.\"\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, be careful, Rita. That door isn\\'t shut.\"\\n\"Well, shut it then,\" laughed the woman.\\nTuppence removed herself speedily.\\nShe dared not absent herself longer from the back premises, but\\nshe cleared away and washed up with a breathless speed acquired\\nin hospital. Then she slipped quietly back to the boudoir door.\\nThe cook, more leisurely, was still busy in the kitchen and, if\\nshe missed the other, would only suppose her to be turning down\\nthe beds.\\nAlas! The conversation inside was being carried on in too low a\\ntone to permit of her hearing anything of it. She dared not\\nreopen the door, however gently. Mrs. Vandemeyer was sitting\\nalmost facing it, and Tuppence respected her mistress\\'s lynx-eyed\\npowers of observation.\\nNevertheless, she felt she would give a good deal to overhear\\nwhat was going on. Possibly, if anything unforeseen had\\nhappened, she might get news of Tommy. For some moments she\\nreflected desperately, then her face brightened. She went quickly\\nalong the passage to Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s bedroom, which had long\\nFrench windows leading on to a balcony that ran the length of the\\nflat. Slipping quickly through the window, Tuppence crept\\nnoiselessly along till she reached the boudoir window. As she had\\nthought it stood a little ajar, and the voices within were\\nplainly audible.\\nTuppence listened attentively, but there was no mention of\\nanything that could be twisted to apply to Tommy. Mrs.\\nVandemeyer and the Russian seemed to be at variance over some\\nmatter, and finally the latter exclaimed bitterly:\\n\"With your persistent recklessness, you will end by ruining us!\"\\n\"Bah!\" laughed the woman. \"Notoriety of the right kind is the\\nbest way of disarming suspicion. You will realize that one of\\nthese days--perhaps sooner than you think!\"\\n\"In the meantime, you are going about everywhere with Peel\\nEdgerton. Not only is he, perhaps, the most celebrated K.C. in\\nEngland, but his special hobby is criminology! It is madness!\"\\n\"I know that his eloquence has saved untold men from the\\ngallows,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer calmly. \"What of it? I may need\\nhis assistance in that line myself some day. If so, how fortunate\\nto have such a friend at court--or perhaps it would be more to\\nthe point to say IN court.\"\\nBoris got up and began striding up and down. He was very\\nexcited.\\n\"You are a clever woman, Rita; but you are also a fool! Be guided\\nby me, and give up Peel Edgerton.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer shook her head gently.\\n\"I think not.\"\\n\"You refuse?\" There was an ugly ring in the Russian\\'s voice.\\n\"I do.\"\\n\"Then, by Heaven,\" snarled the Russian, \"we will see----\" But\\nMrs. Vandemeyer also rose to her feet, her eyes flashing.\\n\"You forget, Boris,\" she said. \"I am accountable to no one. I\\ntake my orders only from--Mr. Brown.\"\\nThe other threw up his hands in despair.\\n\"You are impossible,\" he muttered. \"Impossible! Already it may\\nbe too late. They say Peel Edgerton can SMELL a criminal! How do\\nwe know what is at the bottom of his sudden interest in you?\\nPerhaps even now his suspicions are aroused. He guesses----\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer eyed him scornfully.\\n\"Reassure yourself, my dear Boris. He suspects nothing. With\\nless than your usual chivalry, you seem to forget that I am\\ncommonly accounted a beautiful woman. I assure you that is all\\nthat interests Peel Edgerton.\"\\nBoris shook his head doubtfully.\\n\"He has studied crime as no other man in this kingdom has studied\\nit. Do you fancy that you can deceive him?\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s eyes narrowed.\\n\"If he is all that you say--it would amuse me to try!\"\\n\"Good heavens, Rita----\"\\n\"Besides,\" added Mrs. Vandemeyer, \"he is extremely rich. I am not\\none who despises money. The \\'sinews of war,\\' you know, Boris!\"\\n\"Money--money! That is always the danger with you, Rita. I\\nbelieve you would sell your soul for money. I believe----\" He\\npaused, then in a low, sinister voice he said slowly: \"Sometimes\\nI believe that you would sell--us!\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer smiled and shrugged her shoulders.\\n\"The price, at any rate, would have to be enormous,\" she said\\nlightly. \"It would be beyond the power of anyone but a\\nmillionaire to pay.\"\\n\"Ah!\" snarled the Russian. \"You see, I was right!\"\\n\"My dear Boris, can you not take a joke?\"\\n\"Was it a joke?\"\\n\"Of course.\"\\n\"Then all I can say is that your ideas of humour are peculiar, my\\ndear Rita.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer smiled.\\n\"Let us not quarrel, Boris. Touch the bell. We will have some\\ndrinks.\"\\nTuppence beat a hasty retreat. She paused a moment to survey\\nherself in Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s long glass, and be sure that nothing\\nwas amiss with her appearance. Then she answered the bell\\ndemurely.\\nThe conversation that she had overheard, although interesting in\\nthat it proved beyond doubt the complicity of both Rita and\\nBoris, threw very little light on the present preoccupations. The\\nname of Jane Finn had not even been mentioned.\\nThe following morning a few brief words with Albert informed her\\nthat nothing was waiting for her at the stationer\\'s. It seemed\\nincredible that Tommy, if all was well with him, should not send\\nany word to her. A cold hand seemed to close round her heart....\\nSupposing ... She choked her fears down bravely. It was no good\\nworrying. But she leapt at a chance offered her by Mrs.\\nVandemeyer.\\n\"What day do you usually go out, Prudence?\"\\n\"Friday\\'s my usual day, ma\\'am.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer lifted her eyebrows.\\n\"And to-day is Friday! But I suppose you hardly wish to go out\\nto-day, as you only came yesterday.\"\\n\"I was thinking of asking you if I might, ma\\'am.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer looked at her a minute longer, and then smiled.\\n\"I wish Count Stepanov could hear you. He made a suggestion\\nabout you last night.\" Her smile broadened, catlike. \"Your\\nrequest is very--typical. I am satisfied. You do not understand\\nall this--but you can go out to-day. It makes no difference to\\nme, as I shall not be dining at home.\"\\n\"Thank you, ma\\'am.\"\\nTuppence felt a sensation of relief once she was out of the\\nother\\'s presence. Once again she admitted to herself that she was\\nafraid, horribly afraid, of the beautiful woman with the cruel\\neyes.\\nIn the midst of a final desultory polishing of her silver,\\nTuppence was disturbed by the ringing of the front door bell, and\\nwent to answer it. This time the visitor was neither Whittington\\nnor Boris, but a man of striking appearance.\\nJust a shade over average height, he nevertheless conveyed the\\nimpression of a big man. His face, clean-shaven and exquisitely\\nmobile, was stamped with an expression of power and force far\\nbeyond the ordinary. Magnetism seemed to radiate from him.\\nTuppence was undecided for the moment whether to put him down as\\nan actor or a lawyer, but her doubts were soon solved as he gave\\nher his name: Sir James Peel Edgerton.\\nShe looked at him with renewed interest. This, then, was the\\nfamous K.C. whose name was familiar all over England. She had\\nheard it said that he might one day be Prime Minister. He was\\nknown to have refused office in the interests of his profession,\\npreferring to remain a simple Member for a Scotch constituency.\\nTuppence went back to her pantry thoughtfully. The great man had\\nimpressed her. She understood Boris\\'s agitation. Peel Edgerton\\nwould not be an easy man to deceive.\\nIn about a quarter of an hour the bell rang, and Tuppence\\nrepaired to the hall to show the visitor out. He had given her a\\npiercing glance before. Now, as she handed him his hat and\\nstick, she was conscious of his eyes raking her through. As she\\nopened the door and stood aside to let him pass out, he stopped\\nin the doorway.\\n\"Not been doing this long, eh?\"\\nTuppence raised her eyes, astonished. She read in his glance\\nkindliness, and something else more difficult to fathom.\\nHe nodded as though she had answered.\\n\"V.A.D. and hard up, I suppose?\"\\n\"Did Mrs. Vandemeyer tell you that?\" asked Tuppence suspiciously.\\n\"No, child. The look of you told me. Good place here?\"\\n\"Very good, thank you, sir.\"\\n\"Ah, but there are plenty of good places nowadays. And a change\\ndoes no harm sometimes.\"\\n\"Do you mean----?\" began Tuppence.\\nBut Sir James was already on the topmost stair. He looked back\\nwith his kindly, shrewd glance.\\n\"Just a hint,\" he said. \"That\\'s all.\"\\nTuppence went back to the pantry more thoughtful than ever.\\nCHAPTER XI\\nJULIUS TELLS A STORY\\nDRESSED appropriately, Tuppence duly sallied forth for her\\n\"afternoon out.\" Albert was in temporary abeyance, but Tuppence\\nwent herself to the stationer\\'s to make quite sure that nothing\\nhad come for her. Satisfied on this point, she made her way to\\nthe Ritz. On inquiry she learnt that Tommy had not yet returned.\\nIt was the answer she had expected, but it was another nail in\\nthe coffin of her hopes. She resolved to appeal to Mr. Carter,\\ntelling him when and where Tommy had started on his quest, and\\nasking him to do something to trace him. The prospect of his aid\\nrevived her mercurial spirits, and she next inquired for Julius\\nHersheimmer. The reply she got was to the effect that he had\\nreturned about half an hour ago, but had gone out immediately.\\nTuppence\\'s spirits revived still more. It would be something to\\nsee Julius. Perhaps he could devise some plan for finding out\\nwhat had become of Tommy. She wrote her note to Mr. Carter in\\nJulius\\'s sitting-room, and was just addressing the envelope when\\nthe door burst open.\\n\"What the hell----\" began Julius, but checked himself abruptly.\\n\"I beg your pardon, Miss Tuppence. Those fools down at the\\noffice would have it that Beresford wasn\\'t here any\\nlonger--hadn\\'t been here since Wednesday. Is that so?\"\\nTuppence nodded.\\n\"You don\\'t know where he is?\" she asked faintly.\\n\"I? How should I know? I haven\\'t had one darned word from him,\\nthough I wired him yesterday morning.\"\\n\"I expect your wire\\'s at the office unopened.\"\\n\"But where is he?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know. I hoped you might.\"\\n\"I tell you I haven\\'t had one darned word from him since we\\nparted at the depot on Wednesday.\"\\n\"What depot?\"\\n\"Waterloo. Your London and South Western road.\"\\n\"Waterloo?\" frowned Tuppence.\\n\"Why, yes. Didn\\'t he tell you?\"\\n\"I haven\\'t seen him either,\" replied Tuppence impatiently. \"Go on\\nabout Waterloo. What were you doing there?\"\\n\"He gave me a call. Over the phone. Told me to get a move on,\\nand hustle. Said he was trailing two crooks.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence, her eyes opening. \"I see. Go on.\"\\n\"I hurried along right away. Beresford was there. He pointed\\nout the crooks. The big one was mine, the guy you bluffed. Tommy\\nshoved a ticket into my hand and told me to get aboard the cars.\\nHe was going to sleuth the other crook.\" Julius paused. \"I\\nthought for sure you\\'d know all this.\"\\n\"Julius,\" said Tuppence firmly, \"stop walking up and down. It\\nmakes me giddy. Sit down in that armchair, and tell me the whole\\nstory with as few fancy turns of speech as possible.\"\\nMr. Hersheimmer obeyed.\\n\"Sure,\" he said. \"Where shall I begin?\"\\n\"Where you left off. At Waterloo.\"\\n\"Well,\" began Julius, \"I got into one of your dear old-fashioned\\nfirst-class British compartments. The train was just off. First\\nthing I knew a guard came along and informed me mighty politely\\nthat I wasn\\'t in a smoking-carriage. I handed him out half a\\ndollar, and that settled that. I did a bit of prospecting along\\nthe corridor to the next coach. Whittington was there right\\nenough. When I saw the skunk, with his big sleek fat face, and\\nthought of poor little Jane in his clutches, I felt real mad that\\nI hadn\\'t got a gun with me. I\\'d have tickled him up some.\\n\"We got to Bournemouth all right. Whittington took a cab and\\ngave the name of an hotel. I did likewise, and we drove up\\nwithin three minutes of each other. He hired a room, and I hired\\none too. So far it was all plain sailing. He hadn\\'t the remotest\\nnotion that anyone was on to him. Well, he just sat around in\\nthe hotel lounge, reading the papers and so on, till it was time\\nfor dinner. He didn\\'t hurry any over that either.\\n\"I began to think that there was nothing doing, that he\\'d just\\ncome on the trip for his health, but I remembered that he hadn\\'t\\nchanged for dinner, though it was by way of being a slap-up\\nhotel, so it seemed likely enough that he\\'d be going out on his\\nreal business afterwards.\\n\"Sure enough, about nine o\\'clock, so he did. Took a car across\\nthe town--mighty pretty place by the way, I guess I\\'ll take Jane\\nthere for a spell when I find her--and then paid it off and\\nstruck out along those pine-woods on the top of the cliff. I was\\nthere too, you understand. We walked, maybe, for half an hour.\\nThere\\'s a lot of villas all the way along, but by degrees they\\nseemed to get more and more thinned out, and in the end we got to\\none that seemed the last of the bunch. Big house it was, with a\\nlot of piny grounds around it.\\n\"It was a pretty black night, and the carriage drive up to the\\nhouse was dark as pitch. I could hear him ahead, though I\\ncouldn\\'t see him. I had to walk carefully in case he might get on\\nto it that he was being followed. I turned a curve and I was\\njust in time to see him ring the bell and get admitted to the\\nhouse. I just stopped where I was. It was beginning to rain, and\\nI was soon pretty near soaked through. Also, it was almighty\\ncold.\\n\"Whittington didn\\'t come out again, and by and by I got kind of\\nrestive, and began to mouch around. All the ground floor windows\\nwere shuttered tight, but upstairs, on the first floor (it was a\\ntwo-storied house) I noticed a window with a light burning and\\nthe curtains not drawn.\\n\"Now, just opposite to that window, there was a tree growing. It\\nwas about thirty foot away from the house, maybe, and I sort of\\ngot it into my head that, if I climbed up that tree, I\\'d very\\nlikely be able to see into that room. Of course, I knew there\\nwas no reason why Whittington should be in that room rather than\\nin any other--less reason, in fact, for the betting would be on\\nhis being in one of the reception-rooms downstairs. But I guess\\nI\\'d got the hump from standing so long in the rain, and anything\\nseemed better than going on doing nothing. So I started up.\\n\"It wasn\\'t so easy, by a long chalk! The rain had made the\\nboughs mighty slippery, and it was all I could do to keep a\\nfoothold, but bit by bit I managed it, until at last there I was\\nlevel with the window.\\n\"But then I was disappointed. I was too far to the left. I could\\nonly see sideways into the room. A bit of curtain, and a yard of\\nwallpaper was all I could command. Well, that wasn\\'t any manner\\nof good to me, but just as I was going to give it up, and climb\\ndown ignominiously, some one inside moved and threw his shadow on\\nmy little bit of wall--and, by gum, it was Whittington!\\n\"After that, my blood was up. I\\'d just got to get a look into\\nthat room. It was up to me to figure out how. I noticed that\\nthere was a long branch running out from the tree in the right\\ndirection. If I could only swarm about half-way along it, the\\nproposition would be solved. But it was mighty uncertain whether\\nit would bear my weight. I decided I\\'d just got to risk that, and\\nI started. Very cautiously, inch by inch, I crawled along. The\\nbough creaked and swayed in a nasty fashion, and it didn\\'t do to\\nthink of the drop below, but at last I got safely to where I\\nwanted to be.\\n\"The room was medium-sized, furnished in a kind of bare hygienic\\nway. There was a table with a lamp on it in the middle of the\\nroom, and sitting at that table, facing towards me, was\\nWhittington right enough. He was talking to a woman dressed as a\\nhospital nurse. She was sitting with her back to me, so I\\ncouldn\\'t see her face. Although the blinds were up, the window\\nitself was shut, so I couldn\\'t catch a word of what they said.\\nWhittington seemed to be doing all the talking, and the nurse\\njust listened. Now and then she nodded, and sometimes she\\'d shake\\nher head, as though she were answering questions. He seemed very\\nemphatic--once or twice he beat with his fist on the table. The\\nrain had stopped now, and the sky was clearing in that sudden way\\nit does.\\n\"Presently, he seemed to get to the end of what he was saying.\\nHe got up, and so did she. He looked towards the window and\\nasked something--I guess it was whether it was raining. Anyway,\\nshe came right across and looked out. Just then the moon came out\\nfrom behind the clouds. I was scared the woman would catch sight\\nof me, for I was full in the moonlight. I tried to move back a\\nbit. The jerk I gave was too much for that rotten old branch.\\nWith an almighty crash, down it came, and Julius P. Hersheimmer\\nwith it!\"\\n\"Oh, Julius,\" breathed Tuppence, \"how exciting! Go on.\"\\n\"Well, luckily for me, I pitched down into a good soft bed of\\nearth--but it put me out of action for the time, sure enough. The\\nnext thing I knew, I was lying in bed with a hospital nurse (not\\nWhittington\\'s one) on one side of me, and a little black-bearded\\nman with gold glasses, and medical man written all over him, on\\nthe other. He rubbed his hands together, and raised his eyebrows\\nas I stared at him. \\'Ah!\\' he said. \\'So our young friend is\\ncoming round again. Capital. Capital.\\'\\n\"I did the usual stunt. Said: \\'What\\'s happened?\\' And \\'Where am\\nI?\\' But I knew the answer to the last well enough. There\\'s no\\nmoss growing on my brain. \\'I think that\\'ll do for the present,\\nsister,\\' said the little man, and the nurse left the room in a\\nsort of brisk well-trained way. But I caught her handing me out a\\nlook of deep curiosity as she passed through the door.\\n\"That look of hers gave me an idea. \\'Now then, doc,\\' I said, and\\ntried to sit up in bed, but my right foot gave me a nasty twinge\\nas I did so. \\'A slight sprain,\\' explained the doctor. \\'Nothing\\nserious. You\\'ll be about again in a couple of days.\\' \"\\n\"I noticed you walked lame,\" interpolated Tuppence.\\nJulius nodded, and continued:\\n\" \\'How did it happen?\\' I asked again. He replied dryly. \\'You\\nfell, with a considerable portion of one of my trees, into one of\\nmy newly planted flower-beds.\\'\\n\"I liked the man. He seemed to have a sense of humour. I felt\\nsure that he, at least, was plumb straight. \\'Sure, doc,\\' I said,\\n\\'I\\'m sorry about the tree, and I guess the new bulbs will be on\\nme. But perhaps you\\'d like to know what I was doing in your\\ngarden?\\' \\'I think the facts do call for an explanation,\\' he\\nreplied. \\'Well, to begin with, I wasn\\'t after the spoons.\\'\\n\"He smiled. \\'My first theory. But I soon altered my mind. By\\nthe way, you are an American, are you not?\\' I told him my name.\\n\\'And you?\\' \\'I am Dr. Hall, and this, as you doubtless know, is\\nmy private nursing home.\\'\\n\"I didn\\'t know, but I wasn\\'t going to put him wise. I was just\\nthankful for the information. I liked the man, and I felt he was\\nstraight, but I wasn\\'t going to give him the whole story. For one\\nthing he probably wouldn\\'t have believed it.\\n\"I made up my mind in a flash. \\'Why, doctor,\\' I said, \\'I guess I\\nfeel an almighty fool, but I owe it to you to let you know that\\nit wasn\\'t the Bill Sikes business I was up to.\\' Then I went on\\nand mumbled out something about a girl. I trotted out the stern\\nguardian business, and a nervous breakdown, and finally explained\\nthat I had fancied I recognized her among the patients at the\\nhome, hence my nocturnal adventures. I guess it was just the\\nkind of story he was expecting. \\'Quite a romance,\\' he said\\ngenially, when I\\'d finished. \\'Now, doc,\\' I went on, \\'will you be\\nfrank with me? Have you here now, or have you had here at any\\ntime, a young girl called Jane Finn?\\' He repeated the name\\nthoughtfully. \\'Jane Finn?\\' he said. \\'No.\\'\\n\"I was chagrined, and I guess I showed it. \\'You are sure?\\'\\n\\'Quite sure, Mr. Hersheimmer. It is an uncommon name, and I\\nshould not have been likely to forget it.\\'\\n\"Well, that was flat. It laid me out for a space. I\\'d kind of\\nhoped my search was at an end. \\'That\\'s that,\\' I said at last.\\n\\'Now, there\\'s another matter. When I was hugging that darned\\nbranch I thought I recognized an old friend of mine talking to\\none of your nurses.\\' I purposely didn\\'t mention any name\\nbecause, of course, Whittington might be calling himself\\nsomething quite different down here, but the doctor answered at\\nonce. \\'Mr. Whittington, perhaps?\\' \\'That\\'s the fellow,\\' I\\nreplied. \\'What\\'s he doing down here? Don\\'t tell me HIS nerves\\nare out of order?\\'\\n\"Dr. Hall laughed. \\'No. He came down to see one of my nurses,\\nNurse Edith, who is a niece of his.\\' \\'Why, fancy that!\\' I\\nexclaimed. \\'Is he still here?\\' \\'No, he went back to town almost\\nimmediately.\\' \\'What a pity!\\' I ejaculated. \\'But perhaps I could\\nspeak to his niece--Nurse Edith, did you say her name was?\\'\\n\"But the doctor shook his head. \\'I\\'m afraid that, too, is\\nimpossible. Nurse Edith left with a patient to-night also.\\' \\'I\\nseem to be real unlucky,\\' I remarked. \\'Have you Mr.\\nWhittington\\'s address in town? I guess I\\'d like to look him up\\nwhen I get back.\\' \\'I don\\'t know his address. I can write to\\nNurse Edith for it if you like.\\' I thanked him. \\'Don\\'t say who\\nit is wants it. I\\'d like to give him a little surprise.\\'\\n\"That was about all I could do for the moment. Of course, if the\\ngirl was really Whittington\\'s niece, she might be too cute to\\nfall into the trap, but it was worth trying. Next thing I did\\nwas to write out a wire to Beresford saying where I was, and that\\nI was laid up with a sprained foot, and telling him to come down\\nif he wasn\\'t busy. I had to be guarded in what I said. However,\\nI didn\\'t hear from him, and my foot soon got all right. It was\\nonly ricked, not really sprained, so to-day I said good-bye to\\nthe little doctor chap, asked him to send me word if he heard\\nfrom Nurse Edith, and came right away back to town. Say, Miss\\nTuppence, you\\'re looking mighty pale!\"\\n\"It\\'s Tommy,\" said Tuppence. \"What can have happened to him?\"\\n\"Buck up, I guess he\\'s all right really. Why shouldn\\'t he be?\\nSee here, it was a foreign-looking guy he went off after. Maybe\\nthey\\'ve gone abroad--to Poland, or something like that?\"\\nTuppence shook her head.\\n\"He couldn\\'t without passports and things. Besides I\\'ve seen\\nthat man, Boris Something, since. He dined with Mrs. Vandemeyer\\nlast night.\"\\n\"Mrs. Who?\"\\n\"I forgot. Of course you don\\'t know all that.\"\\n\"I\\'m listening,\" said Julius, and gave vent to his favourite\\nexpression. \"Put me wise.\"\\nTuppence thereupon related the events of the last two days.\\nJulius\\'s astonishment and admiration were unbounded.\\n\"Bully for you! Fancy you a menial. It just tickles me to\\ndeath!\" Then he added seriously: \"But say now, I don\\'t like it,\\nMiss Tuppence, I sure don\\'t. You\\'re just as plucky as they make\\n\\'em, but I wish you\\'d keep right out of this. These crooks we\\'re\\nup against would as soon croak a girl as a man any day.\"\\n\"Do you think I\\'m afraid?\" said Tuppence indignantly, valiantly\\nrepressing memories of the steely glitter in Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s\\neyes.\\n\"I said before you were darned plucky. But that doesn\\'t alter\\nfacts.\"\\n\"Oh, bother ME!\" said Tuppence impatiently. \"Let\\'s think about\\nwhat can have happened to Tommy. I\\'ve written to Mr. Carter\\nabout it,\" she added, and told him the gist of her letter.\\nJulius nodded gravely.\\n\"I guess that\\'s good as far as it goes. But it\\'s for us to get\\nbusy and do something.\"\\n\"What can we do?\" asked Tuppence, her spirits rising.\\n\"I guess we\\'d better get on the track of Boris. You say he\\'s\\nbeen to your place. Is he likely to come again?\"\\n\"He might. I really don\\'t know.\"\\n\"I see. Well, I guess I\\'d better buy a car, a slap-up one, dress\\nas a chauffeur and hang about outside. Then if Boris comes, you\\ncould make some kind of signal, and I\\'d trail him. How\\'s that?\"\\n\"Splendid, but he mightn\\'t come for weeks.\"\\n\"We\\'ll have to chance that. I\\'m glad you like the plan.\" He\\nrose.\\n\"Where are you going?\"\\n\"To buy the car, of course,\" replied Julius, surprised. \"What\\nmake do you like? I guess you\\'ll do some riding in it before\\nwe\\'ve finished.\"\\n\"Oh,\" said Tuppence faintly, \"I LIKE Rolls-Royces, but----\"\\n\"Sure,\" agreed Julius. \"What you say goes. I\\'ll get one.\"\\n\"But you can\\'t at once,\" cried Tuppence. \"People wait ages\\nsometimes.\"\\n\"Little Julius doesn\\'t,\" affirmed Mr. Hersheimmer. \"Don\\'t you\\nworry any. I\\'ll be round in the car in half an hour.\"\\nTuppence got up.\\n\"You\\'re awfully good, Julius. But I can\\'t help feeling that it\\'s\\nrather a forlorn hope. I\\'m really pinning my faith to Mr.\\nCarter.\"\\n\"Then I shouldn\\'t.\"\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Just an idea of mine.\"\\n\"Oh; but he must do something. There\\'s no one else. By the way,\\nI forgot to tell you of a queer thing that happened this\\nmorning.\"\\nAnd she narrated her encounter with Sir James Peel Edgerton.\\nJulius was interested.\\n\"What did the guy mean, do you think?\" he asked.\\n\"I don\\'t quite know,\" said Tuppence meditatively. \"But I think\\nthat, in an ambiguous, legal, without prejudishish lawyer\\'s way,\\nhe was trying to warn me.\"\\n\"Why should he?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" confessed Tuppence. \"But he looked kind, and\\nsimply awfully clever. I wouldn\\'t mind going to him and telling\\nhim everything.\"\\nSomewhat to her surprise, Julius negatived the idea sharply.\\n\"See here,\" he said, \"we don\\'t want any lawyers mixed up in this.\\nThat guy couldn\\'t help us any.\"\\n\"Well, I believe he could,\" reiterated Tuppence obstinately.\\n\"Don\\'t you think it. So long. I\\'ll be back in half an hour.\"\\nThirty-five minutes had elapsed when Julius returned. He took\\nTuppence by the arm, and walked her to the window.\\n\"There she is.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence with a note of reverence in her voice, as she\\ngazed down at the enormous car.\\n\"She\\'s some pace-maker, I can tell you,\" said Julius\\ncomplacently.\\n\"How did you get it?\" gasped Tuppence.\\n\"She was just being sent home to some bigwig.\"\\n\"Well?\"\\n\"I went round to his house,\" said Julius. \"I said that I\\nreckoned a car like that was worth every penny of twenty thousand\\ndollars. Then I told him that it was worth just about fifty\\nthousand dollars to me if he\\'d get out.\"\\n\"Well?\" said Tuppence, intoxicated.\\n\"Well,\" returned Julius, \"he got out, that\\'s all.\"\\nCHAPTER XII\\nA FRIEND IN NEED\\nFRIDAY and Saturday passed uneventfully. Tuppence had received a\\nbrief answer to her appeal from Mr. Carter. In it he pointed out\\nthat the Young Adventurers had undertaken the work at their own\\nrisk, and had been fully warned of the dangers. If anything had\\nhappened to Tommy he regretted it deeply, but he could do\\nnothing.\\nThis was cold comfort. Somehow, without Tommy, all the savour\\nwent out of the adventure, and, for the first time, Tuppence felt\\ndoubtful of success. While they had been together she had never\\nquestioned it for a minute. Although she was accustomed to take\\nthe lead, and to pride herself on her quick-wittedness, in\\nreality she had relied upon Tommy more than she realized at the\\ntime. There was something so eminently sober and clear-headed\\nabout him, his common sense and soundness of vision were so\\nunvarying, that without him Tuppence felt much like a rudderless\\nship. It was curious that Julius, who was undoubtedly much\\ncleverer than Tommy, did not give her the same feeling of\\nsupport. She had accused Tommy of being a pessimist, and it is\\ncertain that he always saw the disadvantages and difficulties\\nwhich she herself was optimistically given to overlooking, but\\nnevertheless she had really relied a good deal on his judgment.\\nHe might be slow, but he was very sure.\\nIt seemed to the girl that, for the first time, she realized the\\nsinister character of the mission they had undertaken so\\nlightheartedly. It had begun like a page of romance. Now, shorn\\nof its glamour, it seemed to be turning to grim reality.\\nTommy--that was all that mattered. Many times in the day Tuppence\\nblinked the tears out of her eyes resolutely. \"Little fool,\" she\\nwould apostrophize herself, \"don\\'t snivel. Of course you\\'re fond\\nof him. You\\'ve known him all your life. But there\\'s no need to\\nbe sentimental about it.\"\\nIn the meantime, nothing more was seen of Boris. He did not come\\nto the flat, and Julius and the car waited in vain. Tuppence\\ngave herself over to new meditations. Whilst admitting the truth\\nof Julius\\'s objections, she had nevertheless not entirely\\nrelinquished the idea of appealing to Sir James Peel Edgerton.\\nIndeed, she had gone so far as to look up his address in the Red\\nBook. Had he meant to warn her that day? If so, why? Surely she\\nwas at least entitled to demand an explanation. He had looked at\\nher so kindly. Perhaps he might tell them something concerning\\nMrs. Vandemeyer which might lead to a clue to Tommy\\'s\\nwhereabouts.\\nAnyway, Tuppence decided, with her usual shake of the shoulders,\\nit was worth trying, and try it she would. Sunday was her\\nafternoon out. She would meet Julius, persuade him to her point\\nof view, and they would beard the lion in his den.\\nWhen the day arrived Julius needed a considerable amount of\\npersuading, but Tuppence held firm. \"It can do no harm,\" was\\nwhat she always came back to. In the end Julius gave in, and\\nthey proceeded in the car to Carlton House Terrace.\\nThe door was opened by an irreproachable butler. Tuppence felt a\\nlittle nervous. After all, perhaps it WAS colossal cheek on her\\npart. She had decided not to ask if Sir James was \"at home,\" but\\nto adopt a more personal attitude.\\n\"Will you ask Sir James if I can see him for a few minutes? I\\nhave an important message for him.\"\\nThe butler retired, returning a moment or two later.\\n\"Sir James will see you. Will you step this way?\"\\nHe ushered them into a room at the back of the house, furnished\\nas a library. The collection of books was a magnificent one, and\\nTuppence noticed that all one wall was devoted to works on crime\\nand criminology. There were several deep-padded leather\\narm-chairs, and an old-fashioned open hearth. In the window was a\\nbig roll-top desk strewn with papers at which the master of the\\nhouse was sitting.\\nHe rose as they entered.\\n\"You have a message for me? Ah\"--he recognized Tuppence with a\\nsmile--\"it\\'s you, is it? Brought a message from Mrs. Vandemeyer,\\nI suppose?\"\\n\"Not exactly,\" said Tuppence. \"In fact, I\\'m afraid I only said\\nthat to be quite sure of getting in. Oh, by the way, this is Mr.\\nHersheimmer, Sir James Peel Edgerton.\"\\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" said the American, shooting out a hand.\\n\"Won\\'t you both sit down?\" asked Sir James. He drew forward two\\nchairs.\\n\"Sir James,\" said Tuppence, plunging boldly, \"I dare say you will\\nthink it is most awful cheek of me coming here like this.\\nBecause, of course, it\\'s nothing whatever to do with you, and\\nthen you\\'re a very important person, and of course Tommy and I\\nare very unimportant.\" She paused for breath.\\n\"Tommy?\" queried Sir James, looking across at the American.\\n\"No, that\\'s Julius,\" explained Tuppence. \"I\\'m rather nervous,\\nand that makes me tell it badly. What I really want to know is\\nwhat you meant by what you said to me the other day? Did you mean\\nto warn me against Mrs. Vandemeyer? You did, didn\\'t you?\"\\n\"My dear young lady, as far as I recollect I only mentioned that\\nthere were equally good situations to be obtained elsewhere.\"\\n\"Yes, I know. But it was a hint, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\"Well, perhaps it was,\" admitted Sir James gravely.\\n\"Well, I want to know more. I want to know just WHY you gave me\\na hint.\"\\nSir James smiled at her earnestness.\\n\"Suppose the lady brings a libel action against me for defamation\\nof character?\"\\n\"Of course,\" said Tuppence. \"I know lawyers are always\\ndreadfully careful. But can\\'t we say \\'without prejudice\\' first,\\nand then say just what we want to.\"\\n\"Well,\" said Sir James, still smiling, \"without prejudice, then,\\nif I had a young sister forced to earn her living, I should not\\nlike to see her in Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s service. I felt it incumbent\\non me just to give you a hint. It is no place for a young and\\ninexperienced girl. That is all I can tell you.\"\\n\"I see,\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. \"Thank you very much. But\\nI\\'m not REALLY inexperienced, you know. I knew perfectly that\\nshe was a bad lot when I went there--as a matter of fact that\\'s\\nWHY I went----\" She broke off, seeing some bewilderment on the\\nlawyer\\'s face, and went on: \"I think perhaps I\\'d better tell you\\nthe whole story, Sir James. I\\'ve a sort of feeling that you\\'d\\nknow in a minute if I didn\\'t tell the truth, and so you might as\\nwell know all about it from the beginning. What do you think,\\nJulius?\"\\n\"As you\\'re bent on it, I\\'d go right ahead with the facts,\"\\nreplied the American, who had so far sat in silence.\\n\"Yes, tell me all about it,\" said Sir James. \"I want to know who\\nTommy is.\"\\nThus encouraged Tuppence plunged into her tale, and the lawyer\\nlistened with close attention.\\n\"Very interesting,\" he said, when she finished. \"A great deal of\\nwhat you tell me, child, is already known to me. I\\'ve had\\ncertain theories of my own about this Jane Finn. You\\'ve done\\nextraordinarily well so far, but it\\'s rather too bad of--what do\\nyou know him as?--Mr. Carter to pitchfork you two young things\\ninto an affair of this kind. By the way, where did Mr.\\nHersheimmer come in originally? You didn\\'t make that clear?\"\\nJulius answered for himself.\\n\"I\\'m Jane\\'s first cousin,\" he explained, returning the lawyer\\'s\\nkeen gaze.\\n\"Ah!\"\\n\"Oh, Sir James,\" broke out Tuppence, \"what do you think has\\nbecome of Tommy?\"\\n\"H\\'m.\" The lawyer rose, and paced slowly up and down. \"When you\\narrived, young lady, I was just packing up my traps. Going to\\nScotland by the night train for a few days\\' fishing. But there\\nare different kinds of fishing. I\\'ve a good mind to stay, and\\nsee if we can\\'t get on the track of that young chap.\"\\n\"Oh!\" Tuppence clasped her hands ecstatically.\\n\"All the same, as I said before, it\\'s too bad of--of Carter to\\nset you two babies on a job like this. Now, don\\'t get offended,\\nMiss--er----\"\\n\"Cowley. Prudence Cowley. But my friends call me Tuppence.\"\\n\"Well, Miss Tuppence, then, as I\\'m certainly going to be a\\nfriend. Don\\'t be offended because I think you\\'re young. Youth is\\na failing only too easily outgrown. Now, about this young Tommy\\nof yours----\"\\n\"Yes.\" Tuppence clasped her hands.\\n\"Frankly, things look bad for him. He\\'s been butting in\\nsomewhere where he wasn\\'t wanted. Not a doubt of it. But don\\'t\\ngive up hope.\"\\n\"And you really will help us? There, Julius! He didn\\'t want me\\nto come,\" she added by way of explanation.\\n\"H\\'m,\" said the lawyer, favouring Julius with another keen\\nglance. \"And why was that?\"\\n\"I reckoned it would be no good worrying you with a petty little\\nbusiness like this.\"\\n\"I see.\" He paused a moment. \"This petty little business, as\\nyou call it, bears directly on a very big business, bigger\\nperhaps than either you or Miss Tuppence know. If this boy is\\nalive, he may have very valuable information to give us.\\nTherefore, we must find him.\"\\n\"Yes, but how?\" cried Tuppence. \"I\\'ve tried to think of\\neverything.\"\\nSir James smiled.\\n\"And yet there\\'s one person quite near at hand who in all\\nprobability knows where he is, or at all events where he is\\nlikely to be.\"\\n\"Who is that?\" asked Tuppence, puzzled.\\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer.\"\\n\"Yes, but she\\'d never tell us.\"\\n\"Ah, that is where I come in. I think it quite likely that I\\nshall be able to make Mrs. Vandemeyer tell me what I want to\\nknow.\"\\n\"How?\" demanded Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide.\\n\"Oh, just by asking her questions,\" replied Sir James easily.\\n\"That\\'s the way we do it, you know.\"\\nHe tapped with his finger on the table, and Tuppence felt again\\nthe intense power that radiated from the man.\\n\"And if she won\\'t tell?\" asked Julius suddenly.\\n\"I think she will. I have one or two powerful levers. Still, in\\nthat unlikely event, there is always the possibility of bribery.\"\\n\"Sure. And that\\'s where I come in!\" cried Julius, bringing his\\nfist down on the table with a bang. \"You can count on me, if\\nnecessary, for one million dollars. Yes, sir, one million\\ndollars!\"\\nSir James sat down and subjected Julius to a long scrutiny.\\n\"Mr. Hersheimmer,\" he said at last, \"that is a very large sum.\"\\n\"I guess it\\'ll have to be. These aren\\'t the kind of folk to\\noffer sixpence to.\"\\n\"At the present rate of exchange it amounts to considerably over\\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand pounds.\"\\n\"That\\'s so. Maybe you think I\\'m talking through my hat, but I\\ncan deliver the goods all right, with enough over to spare for\\nyour fee.\"\\nSir James flushed slightly.\\n\"There is no question of a fee, Mr. Hersheimmer. I am not a\\nprivate detective.\"\\n\"Sorry. I guess I was just a mite hasty, but I\\'ve been feeling\\nbad about this money question. I wanted to offer a big reward\\nfor news of Jane some days ago, but your crusted institution of\\nScotland Yard advised me against it. Said it was undesirable.\"\\n\"They were probably right,\" said Sir James dryly.\\n\"But it\\'s all O.K. about Julius,\" put in Tuppence. \"He\\'s not\\npulling your leg. He\\'s got simply pots of money.\"\\n\"The old man piled it up in style,\" explained Julius. \"Now,\\nlet\\'s get down to it. What\\'s your idea?\"\\nSir James considered for a moment or two.\\n\"There is no time to be lost. The sooner we strike the better.\"\\nHe turned to Tuppence. \"Is Mrs. Vandemeyer dining out to-night,\\ndo you know?\"\\n\"Yes, I think so, but she will not be out late. Otherwise, she\\nwould have taken the latchkey.\"\\n\"Good. I will call upon her about ten o\\'clock. What time are you\\nsupposed to return?\"\\n\"About nine-thirty or ten, but I could go back earlier.\"\\n\"You must not do that on any account. It might arouse suspicion\\nif you did not stay out till the usual time. Be back by\\nnine-thirty. I will arrive at ten. Mr. Hersheimmer will wait\\nbelow in a taxi perhaps.\"\\n\"He\\'s got a new Rolls-Royce car,\" said Tuppence with vicarious\\npride.\\n\"Even better. If I succeed in obtaining the address from her, we\\ncan go there at once, taking Mrs. Vandemeyer with us if\\nnecessary. You understand?\"\\n\"Yes.\" Tuppence rose to her feet with a skip of delight. \"Oh, I\\nfeel so much better!\"\\n\"Don\\'t build on it too much, Miss Tuppence. Go easy.\"\\nJulius turned to the lawyer.\\n\"Say, then. I\\'ll call for you in the car round about\\nnine-thirty. Is that right?\"\\n\"Perhaps that will be the best plan. It would be unnecessary to\\nhave two cars waiting about. Now, Miss Tuppence, my advice to\\nyou is to go and have a good dinner, a REALLY good one, mind. And\\ndon\\'t think ahead more than you can help.\"\\nHe shook hands with them both, and a moment later they were\\noutside.\\n\"Isn\\'t he a duck?\" inquired Tuppence ecstatically, as she skipped\\ndown the steps. \"Oh, Julius, isn\\'t he just a duck?\"\\n\"Well, I allow he seems to be the goods all right. And I was\\nwrong about its being useless to go to him. Say, shall we go\\nright away back to the Ritz?\"\\n\"I must walk a bit, I think. I feel so excited. Drop me in the\\npark, will you? Unless you\\'d like to come too?\"\\n\"I want to get some petrol,\" he explained. \"And send off a cable\\nor two.\"\\n\"All right. I\\'ll meet you at the Ritz at seven. We\\'ll have to\\ndine upstairs. I can\\'t show myself in these glad rags.\"\\n\"Sure. I\\'ll get Felix help me choose the menu. He\\'s some head\\nwaiter, that. So long.\"\\nTuppence walked briskly along towards the Serpentine, first\\nglancing at her watch. It was nearly six o\\'clock. She remembered\\nthat she had had no tea, but felt too excited to be conscious of\\nhunger. She walked as far as Kensington Gardens and then slowly\\nretraced her steps, feeling infinitely better for the fresh air\\nand exercise. It was not so easy to follow Sir James\\'s advice,\\nand put the possible events of the evening out of her head. As\\nshe drew nearer and nearer to Hyde Park corner, the temptation to\\nreturn to South Audley Mansions was almost irresistible.\\nAt any rate, she decided, it would do no harm just to go and LOOK\\nat the building. Perhaps, then, she could resign herself to\\nwaiting patiently for ten o\\'clock.\\nSouth Audley Mansions looked exactly the same as usual. What\\nTuppence had expected she hardly knew, but the sight of its red\\nbrick stolidity slightly assuaged the growing and entirely\\nunreasonable uneasiness that possessed her. She was just turning\\naway when she heard a piercing whistle, and the faithful Albert\\ncame running from the building to join her.\\nTuppence frowned. It was no part of the programme to have\\nattention called to her presence in the neighbourhood, but Albert\\nwas purple with suppressed excitement.\\n\"I say, miss, she\\'s a-going!\"\\n\"Who\\'s going?\" demanded Tuppence sharply.\\n\"The crook. Ready Rita. Mrs. Vandemeyer. She\\'s a-packing up,\\nand she\\'s just sent down word for me to get her a taxi.\"\\n\"What?\" Tuppence clutched his arm.\\n\"It\\'s the truth, miss. I thought maybe as you didn\\'t know about\\nit.\"\\n\"Albert,\" cried Tuppence, \"you\\'re a brick. If it hadn\\'t been for\\nyou we\\'d have lost her.\"\\nAlbert flushed with pleasure at this tribute.\\n\"There\\'s no time to lose,\" said Tuppence, crossing the road.\\n\"I\\'ve got to stop her. At all costs I must keep her here\\nuntil----\" She broke off. \"Albert, there\\'s a telephone here,\\nisn\\'t there?\"\\nThe boy shook his head.\\n\"The flats mostly have their own, miss. But there\\'s a box just\\nround the corner.\"\\n\"Go to it then, at once, and ring up the Ritz Hotel. Ask for Mr.\\nHersheimmer, and when you get him tell him to get Sir James and\\ncome on at once, as Mrs. Vandemeyer is trying to hook it. If you\\ncan\\'t get him, ring up Sir James Peel Edgerton, you\\'ll find his\\nnumber in the book, and tell him what\\'s happening. You won\\'t\\nforget the names, will you?\"\\nAlbert repeated them glibly. \"You trust to me, miss, it\\'ll be\\nall right. But what about you? Aren\\'t you afraid to trust\\nyourself with her?\"\\n\"No, no, that\\'s all right. BUT GO AND TELEPHONE. Be quick.\"\\nDrawing a long breath, Tuppence entered the Mansions and ran up\\nto the door of No. 20. How she was to detain Mrs. Vandemeyer\\nuntil the two men arrived, she did not know, but somehow or other\\nit had to be done, and she must accomplish the task\\nsingle-handed. What had occasioned this precipitate departure?\\nDid Mrs. Vandemeyer suspect her?\\nSpeculations were idle. Tuppence pressed the bell firmly. She\\nmight learn something from the cook.\\nNothing happened and, after waiting some minutes, Tuppence\\npressed the bell again, keeping her finger on the button for some\\nlittle while. At last she heard footsteps inside, and a moment\\nlater Mrs. Vandemeyer herself opened the door. She lifted her\\neyebrows at the sight of the girl.\\n\"You?\"\\n\"I had a touch of toothache, ma\\'am,\" said Tuppence glibly. \"So\\nthought it better to come home and have a quiet evening.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer said nothing, but she drew back and let Tuppence\\npass into the hall.\\n\"How unfortunate for you,\" she said coldly. \"You had better go\\nto bed.\"\\n\"Oh, I shall be all right in the kitchen, ma\\'am. Cook will----\"\\n\"Cook is out,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer, in a rather disagreeable\\ntone. \"I sent her out. So you see you had better go to bed.\"\\nSuddenly Tuppence felt afraid. There was a ring in Mrs.\\nVandemeyer\\'s voice that she did not like at all. Also, the other\\nwoman was slowly edging her up the passage. Tuppence turned at\\nbay.\\n\"I don\\'t want----\"\\nThen, in a flash, a rim of cold steel touched her temple, and\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s voice rose cold and menacing:\\n\"You damned little fool! Do you think I don\\'t know? No, don\\'t\\nanswer. If you struggle or cry out, I\\'ll shoot you like a dog.\"\\nThe rim of steel pressed a little harder against the girl\\'s\\ntemple.\\n\"Now then, march,\" went on Mrs. Vandemeyer. \"This way--into my\\nroom. In a minute, when I\\'ve done with you, you\\'ll go to bed as I\\ntold you to. And you\\'ll sleep--oh yes, my little spy, you\\'ll\\nsleep all right!\"\\nThere was a sort of hideous geniality in the last words which\\nTuppence did not at all like. For the moment there was nothing\\nto be done, and she walked obediently into Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s\\nbedroom. The pistol never left her forehead. The room was in a\\nstate of wild disorder, clothes were flung about right and left,\\na suit-case and a hat box, half-packed, stood in the middle of\\nthe floor.\\nTuppence pulled herself together with an effort. Her voice shook\\na little, but she spoke out bravely.\\n\"Come now,\" she said. \"This is nonsense. You can\\'t shoot me.\\nWhy, every one in the building would hear the report.\"\\n\"I\\'d risk that,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer cheerfully. \"But, as long\\nas you don\\'t sing out for help, you\\'re all right--and I don\\'t\\nthink you will. You\\'re a clever girl. You deceived ME all right.\\nI hadn\\'t a suspicion of you! So I\\'ve no doubt that you understand\\nperfectly well that this is where I\\'m on top and you\\'re\\nunderneath. Now then--sit on the bed. Put your hands above your\\nhead, and if you value your life don\\'t move them.\"\\nTuppence obeyed passively. Her good sense told her that there\\nwas nothing else to do but accept the situation. If she shrieked\\nfor help there was very little chance of anyone hearing her,\\nwhereas there was probably quite a good chance of Mrs.\\nVandemeyer\\'s shooting her. In the meantime, every minute of delay\\ngained was valuable.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer laid down the revolver on the edge of the\\nwashstand within reach of her hand, and, still eyeing Tuppence\\nlike a lynx in case the girl should attempt to move, she took a\\nlittle stoppered bottle from its place on the marble and poured\\nsome of its contents into a glass which she filled up with water.\\n\"What\\'s that?\" asked Tuppence sharply.\\n\"Something to make you sleep soundly.\"\\nTuppence paled a little.\\n\"Are you going to poison me?\" she asked in a whisper.\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer, smiling agreeably.\\n\"Then I shan\\'t drink it,\" said Tuppence firmly. \"I\\'d much rather\\nbe shot. At any rate that would make a row, and some one might\\nhear it. But I won\\'t be killed off quietly like a lamb.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer stamped her foot.\\n\"Don\\'t be a little fool! Do you really think I want a hue and\\ncry for murder out after me? If you\\'ve any sense at all, you\\'ll\\nrealize that poisoning you wouldn\\'t suit my book at all. It\\'s a\\nsleeping draught, that\\'s all. You\\'ll wake up to-morrow morning\\nnone the worse. I simply don\\'t want the bother of tying you up\\nand gagging you. That\\'s the alternative--and you won\\'t like it, I\\ncan tell you! I can be very rough if I choose. So drink this\\ndown like a good girl, and you\\'ll be none the worse for it.\"\\nIn her heart of hearts Tuppence believed her. The arguments she\\nhad adduced rang true. It was a simple and effective method of\\ngetting her out of the way for the time being. Nevertheless, the\\ngirl did not take kindly to the idea of being tamely put to sleep\\nwithout as much as one bid for freedom. She felt that once Mrs.\\nVandemeyer gave them the slip, the last hope of finding Tommy\\nwould be gone.\\nTuppence was quick in her mental processes. All these\\nreflections passed through her mind in a flash, and she saw where\\na chance, a very problematical chance, lay, and she determined to\\nrisk all in one supreme effort.\\nAccordingly, she lurched suddenly off the bed and fell on her\\nknees before Mrs. Vandemeyer, clutching her skirts frantically.\\n\"I don\\'t believe it,\" she moaned. \"It\\'s poison--I know it\\'s\\npoison. Oh, don\\'t make me drink it\"--her voice rose to a\\nshriek--\"don\\'t make me drink it!\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer, glass in hand, looked down with a curling lip at\\nthis sudden collapse.\\n\"Get up, you little idiot! Don\\'t go on drivelling there. How you\\never had the nerve to play your part as you did I can\\'t think.\"\\nShe stamped her foot. \"Get up, I say.\"\\nBut Tuppence continued to cling and sob, interjecting her sobs\\nwith incoherent appeals for mercy. Every minute gained was to\\nthe good. Moreover, as she grovelled, she moved imperceptibly\\nnearer to her objective.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer gave a sharp impatient exclamation, and jerked\\nthe girl to her knees.\\n\"Drink it at once!\" Imperiously she pressed the glass to the\\ngirl\\'s lips.\\nTuppence gave one last despairing moan.\\n\"You swear it won\\'t hurt me?\" she temporized.\\n\"Of course it won\\'t hurt you. Don\\'t be a fool.\"\\n\"Will you swear it?\"\\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the other impatiently. \"I swear it.\"\\nTuppence raised a trembling left hand to the glass.\\n\"Very well.\" Her mouth opened meekly.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer gave a sigh of relief, off her guard for the\\nmoment. Then, quick as a flash, Tuppence jerked the glass upward\\nas hard as she could. The fluid in it splashed into Mrs.\\nVandemeyer\\'s face, and during her momentary gasp, Tuppence\\'s\\nright hand shot out and grasped the revolver where it lay on the\\nedge of the washstand. The next moment she had sprung back a\\npace, and the revolver pointed straight at Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s\\nheart, with no unsteadiness in the hand that held it.\\nIn the moment of victory, Tuppence betrayed a somewhat\\nunsportsmanlike triumph.\\n\"Now who\\'s on top and who\\'s underneath?\" she crowed.\\nThe other\\'s face was convulsed with rage. For a minute Tuppence\\nthought she was going to spring upon her, which would have placed\\nthe girl in an unpleasant dilemma, since she meant to draw the\\nline at actually letting off the revolver. However, with an\\neffort Mrs. Vandemeyer controlled herself, and at last a slow\\nevil smile crept over her face.\\n\"Not a fool, then, after all! You did that well, girl. But you\\nshall pay for it--oh, yes, you shall pay for it! I have a long\\nmemory!\"\\n\"I\\'m surprised you should have been gulfed so easily,\" said\\nTuppence scornfully. \"Did you really think I was the kind of\\ngirl to roll about on the floor and whine for mercy?\"\\n\"You may do--some day!\" said the other significantly.\\nThe cold malignity of her manner sent an unpleasant chill down\\nTuppence\\'s spine, but she was not going to give in to it.\\n\"Supposing we sit down,\" she said pleasantly. \"Our present\\nattitude is a little melodramatic. No--not on the bed. Draw a\\nchair up to the table, that\\'s right. Now I\\'ll sit opposite you\\nwith the revolver in front of me--just in case of accidents.\\nSplendid. Now, let\\'s talk.\"\\n\"What about?\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer sullenly.\\nTuppence eyed her thoughtfully for a minute. She was remembering\\nseveral things. Boris\\'s words, \"I believe you would sell--us!\"\\nand her answer, \"The price would have to be enormous,\" given\\nlightly, it was true, yet might not there be a substratum of\\ntruth in it? Long ago, had not Whittington asked: \"Who\\'s been\\nblabbing? Rita?\" Would Rita Vandemeyer prove to be the weak\\nspot in the armour of Mr. Brown?\\nKeeping her eyes fixed steadily on the other\\'s face, Tuppence\\nreplied quietly:\\n\"Money----\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer started. Clearly, the reply was unexpected.\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\"I\\'ll tell you. You said just now that you had a long memory. A\\nlong memory isn\\'t half as useful as a long purse! I dare say it\\nrelieves your feelings a good deal to plan out all sorts of\\ndreadful things to do to me, but is that PRACTICAL? Revenge is\\nvery unsatisfactory. Every one always says so. But\\nmoney\"--Tuppence warmed to her pet creed--\"well, there\\'s nothing\\nunsatisfactory about money, is there?\"\\n\"Do you think,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer scornfully, \"that I am the\\nkind of woman to sell my friends?\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence promptly. \"If the price was big enough.\"\\n\"A paltry hundred pounds or so!\"\\n\"No,\" said Tuppence. \"I should suggest--a hundred thousand!\"\\nHer economical spirit did not permit her to mention the whole\\nmillion dollars suggested by Julius.\\nA flush crept over Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s face.\\n\"What did you say?\" she asked, her fingers playing nervously with\\na brooch on her breast. In that moment Tuppence knew that the\\nfish was hooked, and for the first time she felt a horror of her\\nown money-loving spirit. It gave her a dreadful sense of kinship\\nto the woman fronting her.\\n\"A hundred thousand pounds,\" repeated Tuppence.\\nThe light died out of Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s eyes. She leaned back in\\nher chair.\\n\"Bah!\" she said. \"You haven\\'t got it.\"\\n\"No,\" admitted Tuppence, \"I haven\\'t--but I know some one who\\nhas.\"\\n\"Who?\"\\n\"A friend of mine.\"\\n\"Must be a millionaire,\" remarked Mrs. Vandemeyer unbelievingly.\\n\"As a matter of fact he is. He\\'s an American. He\\'ll pay you\\nthat without a murmur. You can take it from me that it\\'s a\\nperfectly genuine proposition.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer sat up again.\\n\"I\\'m inclined to believe you,\" she said slowly.\\nThere was silence between them for some time, then Mrs.\\nVandemeyer looked up.\\n\"What does he want to know, this friend of yours?\"\\nTuppence went through a momentary struggle, but it was Julius\\'s\\nmoney, and his interests must come first.\\n\"He wants to know where Jane Finn is,\" she said boldly.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer showed no surprise.\\n\"I\\'m not sure where she is at the present moment,\" she replied.\\n\"But you could find out?\"\\n\"Oh, yes,\" returned Mrs. Vandemeyer carelessly. \"There would be\\nno difficulty about that.\"\\n\"Then\"--Tuppence\\'s voice shook a little--\"there\\'s a boy, a friend\\nof mine. I\\'m afraid something\\'s happened to him, through your pal\\nBoris.\"\\n\"What\\'s his name?\"\\n\"Tommy Beresford.\"\\n\"Never heard of him. But I\\'ll ask Boris. He\\'ll tell me anything\\nhe knows.\"\\n\"Thank you.\" Tuppence felt a terrific rise in her spirits. It\\nimpelled her to more audacious efforts. \"There\\'s one thing\\nmore.\"\\n\"Well?\"\\nTuppence leaned forward and lowered her voice.\\n\"WHO IS MR. BROWN?\"\\nHer quick eyes saw the sudden paling of the beautiful face. With\\nan effort Mrs. Vandemeyer pulled herself together and tried to\\nresume her former manner. But the attempt was a mere parody.\\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\\n\"You can\\'t have learnt much about us if you don\\'t know that\\nNOBODY KNOWS WHO MR. BROWN IS....\"\\n\"You do,\" said Tuppence quietly.\\nAgain the colour deserted the other\\'s face.\\n\"What makes you think that?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said the girl truthfully. \"But I\\'m sure.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer stared in front of her for a long time.\\n\"Yes,\" she said hoarsely, at last, \"I know. I was beautiful, you\\nsee--very beautiful--\"\\n\"You are still,\" said Tuppence with admiration.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer shook her head. There was a strange gleam in her\\nelectric-blue eyes.\\n\"Not beautiful enough,\" she said in a soft dangerous voice.\\n\"Not--beautiful--enough! And sometimes, lately, I\\'ve been\\nafraid.... It\\'s dangerous to know too much!\" She leaned forward\\nacross the table. \"Swear that my name shan\\'t be brought into\\nit--that no one shall ever know.\"\\n\"I swear it. And, once\\'s he caught, you\\'ll be out of danger.\"\\nA terrified look swept across Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s face.\\n\"Shall I? Shall I ever be?\" She clutched Tuppence\\'s arm.\\n\"You\\'re sure about the money?\"\\n\"Quite sure.\"\\n\"When shall I have it? There must be no delay.\"\\n\"This friend of mine will be here presently. He may have to send\\ncables, or something like that. But there won\\'t be any\\ndelay--he\\'s a terrific hustler.\"\\nA resolute look settled on Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s face.\\n\"I\\'ll do it. It\\'s a great sum of money, and besides\"--she gave a\\ncurious smile--\"it is not--wise to throw over a woman like me!\"\\nFor a moment or two, she remained smiling, and lightly tapping\\nher fingers on the table. Suddenly she started, and her face\\nblanched.\\n\"What was that?\"\\n\"I heard nothing.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer gazed round her fearfully.\\n\"If there should be some one listening----\"\\n\"Nonsense. Who could there be?\"\\n\"Even the walls might have ears,\" whispered the other. \"I tell\\nyou I\\'m frightened. You don\\'t know him!\"\\n\"Think of the hundred thousand pounds,\" said Tuppence soothingly.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer passed her tongue over her dried lips.\\n\"You don\\'t know him,\" she reiterated hoarsely. \"He\\'s--ah!\"\\nWith a shriek of terror she sprang to her feet. Her outstretched\\nhand pointed over Tuppence\\'s head. Then she swayed to the ground\\nin a dead faint.\\nTuppence looked round to see what had startled her.\\nIn the doorway were Sir James Peel Edgerton and Julius\\nHersheimmer.\\nCHAPTER XIII\\nTHE VIGIL\\nSIR James brushed past Julius and hurriedly bent over the fallen\\nwoman.\\n\"Heart,\" he said sharply. \"Seeing us so suddenly must have given\\nher a shock. Brandy--and quickly, or she\\'ll slip through our\\nfingers.\"\\nJulius hurried to the washstand.\\n\"Not there,\" said Tuppence over her shoulder. \"In the tantalus\\nin the dining-room. Second door down the passage.\"\\nBetween them Sir James and Tuppence lifted Mrs. Vandemeyer and\\ncarried her to the bed. There they dashed water on her face, but\\nwith no result. The lawyer fingered her pulse.\\n\"Touch and go,\" he muttered. \"I wish that young fellow would\\nhurry up with the brandy.\"\\nAt that moment Julius re-entered the room, carrying a glass half\\nfull of the spirit which he handed to Sir James. While Tuppence\\nlifted her head the lawyer tried to force a little of the spirit\\nbetween her closed lips. Finally the woman opened her eyes\\nfeebly. Tuppence held the glass to her lips.\\n\"Drink this.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer complied. The brandy brought the colour back to\\nher white cheeks, and revived her in a marvellous fashion. She\\ntried to sit up--then fell back with a groan, her hand to her\\nside.\\n\"It\\'s my heart,\" she whispered. \"I mustn\\'t talk.\"\\nShe lay back with closed eyes.\\nSir James kept his finger on her wrist a minute longer, then\\nwithdrew it with a nod.\\n\"She\\'ll do now.\"\\nAll three moved away, and stood together talking in low voices.\\nOne and all were conscious of a certain feeling of anticlimax.\\nClearly any scheme for cross-questioning the lady was out of the\\nquestion for the moment. For the time being they were baffled,\\nand could do nothing.\\nTuppence related how Mrs. Vandemeyer had declared herself willing\\nto disclose the identity of Mr. Brown, and how she had consented\\nto discover and reveal to them the whereabouts of Jane Finn.\\nJulius was congratulatory.\\n\"That\\'s all right, Miss Tuppence. Splendid! I guess that\\nhundred thousand pounds will look just as good in the morning to\\nthe lady as it did over night. There\\'s nothing to worry over.\\nShe won\\'t speak without the cash anyway, you bet!\"\\nThere was certainly a good deal of common sense in this, and\\nTuppence felt a little comforted.\\n\"What you say is true,\" said Sir James meditatively. \"I must\\nconfess, however, that I cannot help wishing we had not\\ninterrupted at the minute we did. Still, it cannot be helped, it\\nis only a matter of waiting until the morning.\"\\nHe looked across at the inert figure on the bed. Mrs. Vandemeyer\\nlay perfectly passive with closed eyes. He shook his head.\\n\"Well,\" said Tuppence, with an attempt at cheerfulness, \"we must\\nwait until the morning, that\\'s all. But I don\\'t think we ought\\nto leave the flat.\"\\n\"What about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard?\"\\n\"Albert? And suppose she came round again and hooked it. Albert\\ncouldn\\'t stop her.\"\\n\"I guess she won\\'t want to make tracks away from the dollars.\"\\n\"She might. She seemed very frightened of \\'Mr. Brown.\\' \"\\n\"What? Real plumb scared of him?\"\\n\"Yes. She looked round and said even walls had ears.\"\\n\"Maybe she meant a dictaphone,\" said Julius with interest.\\n\"Miss Tuppence is right,\" said Sir James quietly. \"We must not\\nleave the flat--if only for Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s sake.\"\\nJulius stared at him.\\n\"You think he\\'d get after her? Between now and to-morrow\\nmorning. How could he know, even?\"\\n\"You forget your own suggestion of a dictaphone,\" said Sir James\\ndryly. \"We have a very formidable adversary. I believe, if we\\nexercise all due care, that there is a very good chance of his\\nbeing delivered into our hands. But we must neglect no\\nprecaution. We have an important witness, but she must be\\nsafeguarded. I would suggest that Miss Tuppence should go to\\nbed, and that you and I, Mr. Hersheimmer, should share the\\nvigil.\"\\nTuppence was about to protest, but happening to glance at the bed\\nshe saw Mrs. Vandemeyer, her eyes half-open, with such an\\nexpression of mingled fear and malevolence on her face that it\\nquite froze the words on her lips.\\nFor a moment she wondered whether the faint and the heart attack\\nhad been a gigantic sham, but remembering the deadly pallor she\\ncould hardly credit the supposition. As she looked the expression\\ndisappeared as by magic, and Mrs. Vandemeyer lay inert and\\nmotionless as before. For a moment the girl fancied she must have\\ndreamt it. But she determined nevertheless to be on the alert.\\n\"Well,\" said Julius, \"I guess we\\'d better make a move out of here\\nany way.\"\\nThe others fell in with his suggestion. Sir James again felt\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s pulse.\\n\"Perfectly satisfactory,\" he said in a low voice to Tuppence.\\n\"She\\'ll be absolutely all right after a night\\'s rest.\"\\nThe girl hesitated a moment by the bed. The intensity of the\\nexpression she had surprised had impressed her powerfully. Mrs.\\nVandemeyer lifted her lids. She seemed to be struggling to\\nspeak. Tuppence bent over her.\\n\"Don\\'t--leave----\" she seemed unable to proceed, murmuring\\nsomething that sounded like \"sleepy.\" Then she tried again.\\nTuppence bent lower still. It was only a breath.\\n\"Mr.--Brown----\" The voice stopped.\\nBut the half-closed eyes seemed still to send an agonized\\nmessage.\\nMoved by a sudden impulse, the girl said quickly:\\n\"I shan\\'t leave the flat. I shall sit up all night.\"\\nA flash of relief showed before the lids descended once more.\\nApparently Mrs. Vandemeyer slept. But her words had awakened a\\nnew uneasiness in Tuppence. What had she meant by that low\\nmurmur: \"Mr. Brown?\" Tuppence caught herself nervously looking\\nover her shoulder. The big wardrobe loomed up in a sinister\\nfashion before her eyes. Plenty of room for a man to hide in\\nthat.... Half-ashamed of herself, Tuppence pulled it open and\\nlooked inside. No one--of course! She stooped down and looked\\nunder the bed. There was no other possible hiding-place.\\nTuppence gave her familiar shake of the shoulders. It was\\nabsurd, this giving way to nerves! Slowly she went out of the\\nroom. Julius and Sir James were talking in a low voice. Sir James\\nturned to her.\\n\"Lock the door on the outside, please, Miss Tuppence, and take\\nout the key. There must be no chance of anyone entering that\\nroom.\"\\nThe gravity of his manner impressed them, and Tuppence felt less\\nashamed of her attack of \"nerves.\"\\n\"Say,\" remarked Julius suddenly, \"there\\'s Tuppence\\'s bright boy.\\nI guess I\\'d better go down and ease his young mind. That\\'s some\\nlad, Tuppence.\"\\n\"How did you get in, by the way?\" asked Tuppence suddenly. \"I\\nforgot to ask.\"\\n\"Well, Albert got me on the phone all right. I ran round for Sir\\nJames here, and we came right on. The boy was on the look out\\nfor us, and was just a mite worried about what might have\\nhappened to you. He\\'d been listening outside the door of the\\nflat, but couldn\\'t hear anything. Anyhow he suggested sending us\\nup in the coal lift instead of ringing the bell. And sure enough\\nwe landed in the scullery and came right along to find you.\\nAlbert\\'s still below, and must be just hopping mad by this time.\"\\nWith which Julius departed abruptly.\\n\"Now then, Miss Tuppence,\" said Sir James, \"you know this place\\nbetter than I do. Where do you suggest we should take up our\\nquarters?\"\\nTuppence considered for a moment or two.\\n\"I think Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s boudoir would be the most\\ncomfortable,\" she said at last, and led the way there.\\nSir James looked round approvingly.\\n\"This will do very well, and now, my dear young lady, do go to\\nbed and get some sleep.\"\\nTuppence shook her head resolutely.\\n\"I couldn\\'t, thank you, Sir James. I should dream of Mr. Brown\\nall night!\"\\n\"But you\\'ll be so tired, child.\"\\n\"No, I shan\\'t. I\\'d rather stay up--really.\"\\nThe lawyer gave in.\\nJulius reappeared some minutes later, having reassured Albert and\\nrewarded him lavishly for his services. Having in his turn failed\\nto persuade Tuppence to go to bed, he said decisively:\\n\"At any rate, you\\'ve got to have something to eat right away.\\nWhere\\'s the larder?\"\\nTuppence directed him, and he returned in a few minutes with a\\ncold pie and three plates.\\nAfter a hearty meal, the girl felt inclined to pooh-pooh her\\nfancies of half an hour before. The power of the money bribe\\ncould not fail.\\n\"And now, Miss Tuppence,\" said Sir James, \"we want to hear your\\nadventures.\"\\n\"That\\'s so,\" agreed Julius.\\nTuppence narrated her adventures with some complacence. Julius\\noccasionally interjected an admiring \"Bully.\" Sir James said\\nnothing until she had finished, when his quiet \"well done, Miss\\nTuppence,\" made her flush with pleasure.\\n\"There\\'s one thing I don\\'t get clearly,\" said Julius. \"What put\\nher up to clearing out?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" confessed Tuppence.\\nSir James stroked his chin thoughtfully.\\n\"The room was in great disorder. That looks as though her flight\\nwas unpremeditated. Almost as though she got a sudden warning to\\ngo from some one.\"\\n\"Mr. Brown, I suppose,\" said Julius scoffingly.\\nThe lawyer looked at him deliberately for a minute or two.\\n\"Why not?\" he said. \"Remember, you yourself have once been\\nworsted by him.\"\\nJulius flushed with vexation.\\n\"I feel just mad when I think of how I handed out Jane\\'s\\nphotograph to him like a lamb. Gee, if I ever lay hands on it\\nagain, I\\'ll freeze on to it like--like hell!\"\\n\"That contingency is likely to be a remote one,\" said the other\\ndryly.\\n\"I guess you\\'re right,\" said Julius frankly. \"And, in any case,\\nit\\'s the original I\\'m out after. Where do you think she can be,\\nSir James?\"\\nThe lawyer shook his head.\\n\"Impossible to say. But I\\'ve a very good idea where she has\\nbeen.\"\\n\"You have? Where?\"\\nSir James smiled.\\n\"At the scene of your nocturnal adventures, the Bournemouth\\nnursing home.\"\\n\"There? Impossible. I asked.\"\\n\"No, my dear sir, you asked if anyone of the name of Jane Finn\\nhad been there. Now, if the girl had been placed there it would\\nalmost certainly be under an assumed name.\"\\n\"Bully for you,\" cried Julius. \"I never thought of that!\"\\n\"It was fairly obvious,\" said the other.\\n\"Perhaps the doctor\\'s in it too,\" suggested Tuppence.\\nJulius shook his head.\\n\"I don\\'t think so. I took to him at once. No, I\\'m pretty sure\\nDr. Hall\\'s all right.\"\\n\"Hall, did you say?\" asked Sir James. \"That is curious--really\\nvery curious.\"\\n\"Why?\" demanded Tuppence.\\n\"Because I happened to meet him this morning. I\\'ve known him\\nslightly on and off for some years, and this morning I ran across\\nhim in the street. Staying at the Metropole, he told me.\" He\\nturned to Julius. \"Didn\\'t he tell you he was coming up to town?\"\\nJulius shook his head.\\n\"Curious,\" mused Sir James. \"You did not mention his name this\\nafternoon, or I would have suggested your going to him for\\nfurther information with my card as introduction.\"\\n\"I guess I\\'m a mutt,\" said Julius with unusual humility. \"I ought\\nto have thought of the false name stunt.\"\\n\"How could you think of anything after falling out of that tree?\"\\ncried Tuppence. \"I\\'m sure anyone else would have been killed\\nright off.\"\\n\"Well, I guess it doesn\\'t matter now, anyway,\" said Julius.\\n\"We\\'ve got Mrs. Vandemeyer on a string, and that\\'s all we need.\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence, but there was a lack of assurance in her\\nvoice.\\nA silence settled down over the party. Little by little the\\nmagic of the night began to gain a hold on them. There were\\nsudden creaks of the furniture, imperceptible rustlings in the\\ncurtains. Suddenly Tuppence sprang up with a cry.\\n\"I can\\'t help it. I know Mr. Brown\\'s somewhere in the flat! I\\ncan FEEL him.\"\\n\"Sure, Tuppence, how could he be? This door\\'s open into the\\nhall. No one could have come in by the front door without our\\nseeing and hearing him.\"\\n\"I can\\'t help it. I FEEL he\\'s here!\"\\nShe looked appealingly at Sir James, who replied gravely:\\n\"With due deference to your feelings, Miss Tuppence (and mine as\\nwell for that matter), I do not see how it is humanly possible\\nfor anyone to be in the flat without our knowledge.\"\\nThe girl was a little comforted by his wards.\\n\"Sitting up at night is always rather jumpy,\" she confessed.\\n\"Yes,\" said Sir James. \"We are in the condition of people\\nholding a seance. Perhaps if a medium were present we might get\\nsome marvellous results.\"\\n\"Do you believe in spiritualism?\" asked Tuppence, opening her\\neyes wide.\\nThe lawyer shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"There is some truth in it, without a doubt. But most of the\\ntestimony would not pass muster in the witness-box.\"\\nThe hours drew on. With the first faint glimmerings of dawn, Sir\\nJames drew aside the curtains. They beheld, what few Londoners\\nsee, the slow rising of the sun over the sleeping city. Somehow,\\nwith the coming of the light, the dreads and fancies of the past\\nnight seemed absurd. Tuppence\\'s spirits revived to the normal.\\n\"Hooray!\" she said. \"It\\'s going to be a gorgeous day. And we\\nshall find Tommy. And Jane Finn. And everything will be lovely.\\nI shall ask Mr. Carter if I can\\'t be made a Dame!\"\\nAt seven o\\'clock Tuppence volunteered to go and make some tea.\\nShe returned with a tray, containing the teapot and four cups.\\n\"Who\\'s the other cup for?\" inquired Julius.\\n\"The prisoner, of course. I suppose we might call her that?\"\\n\"Taking her tea seems a kind of anticlimax to last night,\" said\\nJulius thoughtfully.\\n\"Yes, it does,\" admitted Tuppence. \"But, anyway, here goes.\\nPerhaps you\\'d both come, too, in case she springs on me, or\\nanything. You see, we don\\'t know what mood she\\'ll wake up in.\"\\nSir James and Julius accompanied her to the door.\\n\"Where\\'s the key? Oh, of course, I\\'ve got it myself.\"\\nShe put it in the lock, and turned it, then paused.\\n\"Supposing, after all, she\\'s escaped?\" she murmured in a whisper.\\n\"Plumb impossible,\" replied Julius reassuringly.\\nBut Sir James said nothing.\\nTuppence drew a long breath and entered. She heaved a sigh of\\nrelief as she saw that Mrs. Vandemeyer was lying on the bed.\\n\"Good morning,\" she remarked cheerfully. \"I\\'ve brought you some\\ntea.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer did not reply. Tuppence put down the cup on the\\ntable by the bed and went across to draw up the blinds. When she\\nturned, Mrs. Vandemeyer still lay without a movement. With a\\nsudden fear clutching at her heart, Tuppence ran to the bed. The\\nhand she lifted was cold as ice.... Mrs. Vandemeyer would never\\nspeak now....\\nHer cry brought the others. A very few minutes sufficed. Mrs.\\nVandemeyer was dead--must have been dead some hours. She had\\nevidently died in her sleep.\\n\"If that isn\\'t the cruellest luck,\" cried Julius in despair.\\nThe lawyer was calmer, but there was a curious gleam in his eyes.\\n\"If it is luck,\" he replied.\\n\"You don\\'t think--but, say, that\\'s plumb impossible--no one could\\nhave got in.\"\\n\"No,\" admitted the lawyer. \"I don\\'t see how they could. And\\nyet--she is on the point of betraying Mr. Brown, and--she dies.\\nIs it only chance?\"\\n\"But how----\"\\n\"Yes, HOW! That is what we must find out.\" He stood there\\nsilently, gently stroking his chin. \"We must find out,\" he said\\nquietly, and Tuppence felt that if she was Mr. Brown she would\\nnot like the tone of those simple words.\\nJulius\\'s glance went to the window.\\n\"The window\\'s open,\" he remarked. \"Do you think----\"\\nTuppence shook her head.\\n\"The balcony only goes along as far as the boudoir. We were\\nthere.\"\\n\"He might have slipped out----\" suggested Julius.\\nBut Sir James interrupted him.\\n\"Mr. Brown\\'s methods are not so crude. In the meantime we must\\nsend for a doctor, but before we do so, is there anything in this\\nroom that might be of value to us?\"\\nHastily, the three searched. A charred mass in the grate\\nindicated that Mrs. Vandemeyer had been burning papers on the eve\\nof her flight. Nothing of importance remained, though they\\nsearched the other rooms as well.\\n\"There\\'s that,\" said Tuppence suddenly, pointing to a small,\\nold-fashioned safe let into the wall. \"It\\'s for jewellery, I\\nbelieve, but there might be something else in it.\"\\nThe key was in the lock, and Julius swung open the door, and\\nsearched inside. He was some time over the task.\\n\"Well,\" said Tuppence impatiently.\\nThere was a pause before Julius answered, then he withdrew his\\nhead and shut to the door.\\n\"Nothing,\" he said.\\nIn five minutes a brisk young doctor arrived, hastily summoned.\\nHe was deferential to Sir James, whom he recognized.\\n\"Heart failure, or possibly an overdose of some\\nsleeping-draught.\" He sniffed. \"Rather an odour of chloral in\\nthe air.\"\\nTuppence remembered the glass she had upset. A new thought drove\\nher to the washstand. She found the little bottle from which\\nMrs. Vandemeyer had poured a few drops.\\nIt had been three parts full. Now--IT WAS EMPTY.\\nCHAPTER XIV\\nA CONSULTATION\\nNOTHING was more surprising and bewildering to Tuppence than the\\nease and simplicity with which everything was arranged, owing to\\nSir James\\'s skilful handling. The doctor accepted quite readily\\nthe theory that Mrs. Vandemeyer had accidentally taken an\\noverdose of chloral. He doubted whether an inquest would be\\nnecessary. If so, he would let Sir James know. He understood\\nthat Mrs. Vandemeyer was on the eve of departure for abroad, and\\nthat the servants had already left? Sir James and his young\\nfriends had been paying a call upon her, when she was suddenly\\nstricken down and they had spent the night in the flat, not\\nliking to leave her alone. Did they know of any relatives? They\\ndid not, but Sir James referred him to Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s\\nsolicitor.\\nShortly afterwards a nurse arrived to take charge, and the other\\nleft the ill-omened building.\\n\"And what now?\" asked Julius, with a gesture of despair. \"I guess\\nwe\\'re down and out for good.\"\\nSir James stroked his chin thoughtfully.\\n\"No,\" he said quietly. \"There is still the chance that Dr. Hall\\nmay be able to tell us something.\"\\n\"Gee! I\\'d forgotten him.\"\\n\"The chance is slight, but it must not be neglected. I think I\\ntold you that he is staying at the Metropole. I should suggest\\nthat we call upon him there as soon as possible. Shall we say\\nafter a bath and breakfast?\"\\nIt was arranged that Tuppence and Julius should return to the\\nRitz, and call for Sir James in the car. This programme was\\nfaithfully carried out, and a little after eleven they drew up\\nbefore the Metropole. They asked for Dr. Hall, and a page-boy\\nwent in search of him. In a few minutes the little doctor came\\nhurrying towards them.\\n\"Can you spare us a few minutes, Dr. Hall?\" said Sir James\\npleasantly. \"Let me introduce you to Miss Cowley. Mr.\\nHersheimmer, I think, you already know.\"\\nA quizzical gleam came into the doctor\\'s eye as he shook hands\\nwith Julius.\\n\"Ah, yes, my young friend of the tree episode! Ankle all right,\\neh?\"\\n\"I guess it\\'s cured owing to your skilful treatment, doc.\"\\n\"And the heart trouble? Ha ha!\"\\n\"Still searching,\" said Julius briefly.\\n\"To come to the point, can we have a word with you in private?\"\\nasked Sir James.\\n\"Certainly. I think there is a room here where we shall be quite\\nundisturbed.\"\\nHe led the way, and the others followed him. They sat down, and\\nthe doctor looked inquiringly at Sir James.\\n\"Dr. Hall, I am very anxious to find a certain young lady for the\\npurpose of obtaining a statement from her. I have reason to\\nbelieve that she has been at one time or another in your\\nestablishment at Bournemouth. I hope I am transgressing no\\nprofessional etiquette in questioning you on the subject?\"\\n\"I suppose it is a matter of testimony?\"\\nSir James hesitated a moment, then he replied:\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"I shall be pleased to give you any information in my power. What\\nis the young lady\\'s name? Mr. Hersheimmer asked me, I\\nremember----\" He half turned to Julius.\\n\"The name,\" said Sir James bluntly, \"is really immaterial. She\\nwould be almost certainly sent to you under an assumed one. But I\\nshould like to know if you are acquainted with a Mrs.\\nVandemeyer?\"\\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer, of 20 South Audley Mansions? I know her\\nslightly.\"\\n\"You are not aware of what has happened?\"\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\"You do not know that Mrs. Vandemeyer is dead?\"\\n\"Dear, dear, I had no idea of it! When did it happen?\"\\n\"She took an overdose of chloral last night.\"\\n\"Purposely?\"\\n\"Accidentally, it is believed. I should not like to say myself.\\nAnyway, she was found dead this morning.\"\\n\"Very sad. A singularly handsome woman. I presume she was a\\nfriend of yours, since you are acquainted with all these\\ndetails.\"\\n\"I am acquainted with the details because--well, it was I who\\nfound her dead.\"\\n\"Indeed,\" said the doctor, starting.\\n\"Yes,\" said Sir James, and stroked his chin reflectively.\\n\"This is very sad news, but you will excuse me if I say that I do\\nnot see how it bears on the subject of your inquiry?\"\\n\"It bears on it in this way, is it not a fact that Mrs.\\nVandemeyer committed a young relative of hers to your charge?\"\\nJulius leaned forward eagerly.\\n\"That is the case,\" said the doctor quietly.\\n\"Under the name of----?\"\\n\"Janet Vandemeyer. I understood her to be a niece of Mrs.\\nVandemeyer\\'s.\"\\n\"And she came to you?\"\\n\"As far as I can remember in June or July of 1915.\"\\n\"Was she a mental case?\"\\n\"She is perfectly sane, if that is what you mean. I understood\\nfrom Mrs. Vandemeyer that the girl had been with her on the\\nLusitania when that ill-fated ship was sunk, and had suffered a\\nsevere shock in consequence.\"\\n\"We\\'re on the right track, I think?\" Sir James looked round.\\n\"As I said before, I\\'m a mutt!\" returned Julius.\\nThe doctor looked at them all curiously.\\n\"You spoke of wanting a statement from her,\" he said. \"Supposing\\nshe is not able to give one?\"\\n\"What? You have just said that she is perfectly sane.\"\\n\"So she is. Nevertheless, if you want a statement from her\\nconcerning any events prior to May 7, 1915, she will not be able\\nto give it to you.\"\\nThey looked at the little man, stupefied. He nodded cheerfully.\\n\"It\\'s a pity,\" he said. \"A great pity, especially as I gather,\\nSir James, that the matter is important. But there it is, she\\ncan tell you nothing.\"\\n\"But why, man? Darn it all, why?\"\\nThe little man shifted his benevolent glance to the excited young\\nAmerican.\\n\"Because Janet Vandemeyer is suffering from a complete loss of\\nmemory.\"\\n\"WHAT?\"\\n\"Quite so. An interesting case, a very interesting case. Not so\\nuncommon, really, as you would think. There are several very\\nwell known parallels. It\\'s the first case of the kind that I\\'ve\\nhad under my own personal observation, and I must admit that I\\'ve\\nfound it of absorbing interest.\" There was something rather\\nghoulish in the little man\\'s satisfaction.\\n\"And she remembers nothing,\" said Sir James slowly.\\n\"Nothing prior to May 7, 1915. After that date her memory is as\\ngood as yours or mine.\"\\n\"Then the first thing she remembers?\"\\n\"Is landing with the survivors. Everything before that is a\\nblank. She did not know her own name, or where she had come from,\\nor where she was. She couldn\\'t even speak her own tongue.\"\\n\"But surely all this is most unusual?\" put in Julius.\\n\"No, my dear sir. Quite normal under the circumstances. Severe\\nshock to the nervous system. Loss of memory proceeds nearly\\nalways on the same lines. I suggested a specialist, of course.\\nThere\\'s a very good man in Paris--makes a study of these\\ncases--but Mrs. Vandemeyer opposed the idea of publicity that\\nmight result from such a course.\"\\n\"I can imagine she would,\" said Sir James grimly.\\n\"I fell in with her views. There is a certain notoriety given to\\nthese cases. And the girl was very young--nineteen, I believe.\\nIt seemed a pity that her infirmity should be talked about--might\\ndamage her prospects. Besides, there is no special treatment to\\npursue in such cases. It is really a matter of waiting.\"\\n\"Waiting?\"\\n\"Yes, sooner or later, the memory will return--as suddenly as it\\nwent. But in all probability the girl will have entirely\\nforgotten the intervening period, and will take up life where she\\nleft off--at the sinking of the Lusitania.\"\\n\"And when do you expect this to happen?\"\\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"Ah, that I cannot say. Sometimes it is a matter of months,\\nsometimes it has been known to be as long as twenty years!\\nSometimes another shock does the trick. One restores what the\\nother took away.\"\\n\"Another shock, eh?\" said Julius thoughtfully.\\n\"Exactly. There was a case in Colorado----\" The little man\\'s\\nvoice trailed on, voluble, mildly enthusiastic.\\nJulius did not seem to be listening. He had relapsed into his\\nown thoughts and was frowning. Suddenly he came out of his brown\\nstudy, and hit the table such a resounding bang with his fist\\nthat every one jumped, the doctor most of all.\\n\"I\\'ve got it! I guess, doc, I\\'d like your medical opinion on the\\nplan I\\'m about to outline. Say Jane was to cross the herring\\npond again, and the same thing was to happen. The submarine, the\\nsinking ship, every one to take to the boats--and so on.\\nWouldn\\'t that do the trick? Wouldn\\'t it give a mighty big bump to\\nher subconscious self, or whatever the jargon is, and start it\\nfunctioning again right away?\"\\n\"A very interesting speculation, Mr. Hersheimmer. In my own\\nopinion, it would be successful. It is unfortunate that there is\\nno chance of the conditions repeating themselves as you suggest.\"\\n\"Not by nature, perhaps, doc. But I\\'m talking about art.\"\\n\"Art?\"\\n\"Why, yes. What\\'s the difficulty? Hire a liner----\"\\n\"A liner!\" murmured Dr. Hall faintly.\\n\"Hire some passengers, hire a submarine--that\\'s the only\\ndifficulty, I guess. Governments are apt to be a bit hidebound\\nover their engines of war. They won\\'t sell to the firstcomer.\\nStill, I guess that can be got over. Ever heard of the word\\n\\'graft,\\' sir? Well, graft gets there every time! I reckon that\\nwe shan\\'t really need to fire a torpedo. If every one hustles\\nround and screams loud enough that the ship is sinking, it ought\\nto be enough for an innocent young girl like Jane. By the time\\nshe\\'s got a life-belt on her, and is being hustled into a boat,\\nwith a well-drilled lot of artistes doing the hysterical stunt on\\ndeck, why--she ought to be right back where she was in May, 1915.\\nHow\\'s that for the bare outline?\"\\nDr. Hall looked at Julius. Everything that he was for the moment\\nincapable of saying was eloquent in that look.\\n\"No,\" said Julius, in answer to it, \"I\\'m not crazy. The thing\\'s\\nperfectly possible. It\\'s done every day in the States for the\\nmovies. Haven\\'t you seen trains in collision on the screen?\\nWhat\\'s the difference between buying up a train and buying up a\\nliner? Get the properties and you can go right ahead!\"\\nDr. Hall found his voice.\\n\"But the expense, my dear sir.\" His voice rose. \"The expense!\\nIt will be COLOSSAL!\"\\n\"Money doesn\\'t worry me any,\" explained Julius simply.\\nDr. Hall turned an appealing face to Sir James, who smiled\\nslightly.\\n\"Mr. Hersheimmer is very well off--very well off indeed.\"\\nThe doctor\\'s glance came back to Julius with a new and subtle\\nquality in it. This was no longer an eccentric young fellow with\\na habit of falling off trees. The doctor\\'s eyes held the\\ndeference accorded to a really rich man.\\n\"Very remarkable plan. Very remarkable,\" he murmured. \"The\\nmovies--of course! Your American word for the kinema. Very\\ninteresting. I fear we are perhaps a little behind the times over\\nhere in our methods. And you really mean to carry out this\\nremarkable plan of yours.\"\\n\"You bet your bottom dollar I do.\"\\nThe doctor believed him--which was a tribute to his nationality.\\nIf an Englishman had suggested such a thing, he would have had\\ngrave doubts as to his sanity.\\n\"I cannot guarantee a cure,\" he pointed out. \"Perhaps I ought to\\nmake that quite clear.\"\\n\"Sure, that\\'s all right,\" said Julius. \"You just trot out Jane,\\nand leave the rest to me.\"\\n\"Jane?\"\\n\"Miss Janet Vandemeyer, then. Can we get on the long distance to\\nyour place right away, and ask them to send her up; or shall I\\nrun down and fetch her in my car?\"\\nThe doctor stared.\\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Hersheimmer. I thought you understood.\"\\n\"Understood what?\"\\n\"That Miss Vandemeyer is no longer under my care.\"\\nCHAPTER XV\\nTUPPENCE RECEIVES A PROPOSAL\\nJULIUS sprang up.\\n\"What?\"\\n\"I thought you were aware of that.\"\\n\"When did she leave?\"\\n\"Let me see. To-day is Monday, is it not? It must have been\\nlast Wednesday--why, surely--yes, it was the same evening that\\nyou--er--fell out of my tree.\"\\n\"That evening? Before, or after?\"\\n\"Let me see--oh yes, afterwards. A very urgent message arrived\\nfrom Mrs. Vandemeyer. The young lady and the nurse who was in\\ncharge of her left by the night train.\"\\nJulius sank back again into his chair.\\n\"Nurse Edith--left with a patient--I remember,\" he muttered. \"My\\nGod, to have been so near!\"\\nDr. Hall looked bewildered.\\n\"I don\\'t understand. Is the young lady not with her aunt, after\\nall?\"\\nTuppence shook her head. She was about to speak when a warning\\nglance from Sir James made her hold her tongue. The lawyer rose.\\n\"I\\'m much obliged to you, Hall. We\\'re very grateful for all\\nyou\\'ve told us. I\\'m afraid we\\'re now in the position of having to\\ntrack Miss Vandemeyer anew. What about the nurse who accompanied\\nher; I suppose you don\\'t know where she is?\"\\nThe doctor shook his head.\\n\"We\\'ve not heard from her, as it happens. I understood she was\\nto remain with Miss Vandemeyer for a while. But what can have\\nhappened? Surely the girl has not been kidnapped.\"\\n\"That remains to be seen,\" said Sir James gravely.\\nThe other hesitated.\\n\"You do not think I ought to go to the police?\"\\n\"No, no. In all probability the young lady is with other\\nrelations.\"\\nThe doctor was not completely satisfied, but he saw that Sir\\nJames was determined to say no more, and realized that to try and\\nextract more information from the famous K.C. would be mere waste\\nof labour. Accordingly, he wished them goodbye, and they left the\\nhotel. For a few minutes they stood by the car talking.\\n\"How maddening,\" cried Tuppence. \"To think that Julius must have\\nbeen actually under the same roof with her for a few hours.\"\\n\"I was a darned idiot,\" muttered Julius gloomily.\\n\"You couldn\\'t know,\" Tuppence consoled him. \"Could he?\" She\\nappealed to Sir James.\\n\"I should advise you not to worry,\" said the latter kindly. \"No\\nuse crying over spilt milk, you know.\"\\n\"The great thing is what to do next,\" added Tuppence the\\npractical.\\nSir James shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"You might advertise for the nurse who accompanied the girl. That\\nis the only course I can suggest, and I must confess I do not\\nhope for much result. Otherwise there is nothing to be done.\"\\n\"Nothing?\" said Tuppence blankly. \"And--Tommy?\"\\n\"We must hope for the best,\" said Sir James. \"Oh yes, we must go\\non hoping.\"\\nBut over her downcast head his eyes met Julius\\'s, and almost\\nimperceptibly he shook his head. Julius understood. The lawyer\\nconsidered the case hopeless. The young American\\'s face grew\\ngrave. Sir James took Tuppence\\'s hand.\\n\"You must let me know if anything further comes to light. Letters\\nwill always be forwarded.\"\\nTuppence stared at him blankly.\\n\"You are going away?\"\\n\"I told you. Don\\'t you remember? To Scotland.\"\\n\"Yes, but I thought----\" The girl hesitated.\\nSir James shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"My dear young lady, I can do nothing more, I fear. Our clues\\nhave all ended in thin air. You can take my word for it that\\nthere is nothing more to be done. If anything should arise, I\\nshall be glad to advise you in any way I can.\"\\nHis words gave Tuppence an extraordinarily desolate feeling.\\n\"I suppose you\\'re right,\" she said. \"Anyway, thank you very much\\nfor trying to help us. Good-bye.\"\\nJulius was bending over the car. A momentary pity came into Sir\\nJames\\'s keen eyes, as he gazed into the girl\\'s downcast face.\\n\"Don\\'t be too disconsolate, Miss Tuppence,\" he said in a low\\nvoice. \"Remember, holiday-time isn\\'t always all playtime. One\\nsometimes manages to put in some work as well.\"\\nSomething in his tone made Tuppence glance up sharply. He shook\\nhis head with a smile.\\n\"No, I shan\\'t say any more. Great mistake to say too much.\\nRemember that. Never tell all you know--not even to the person\\nyou know best. Understand? Good-bye.\"\\nHe strode away. Tuppence stared after him. She was beginning to\\nunderstand Sir James\\'s methods. Once before he had thrown her a\\nhint in the same careless fashion. Was this a hint? What exactly\\nlay behind those last brief words? Did he mean that, after all,\\nhe had not abandoned the case; that, secretly, he would be\\nworking on it still while----\\nHer meditations were interrupted by Julius, who adjured her to\\n\"get right in.\"\\n\"You\\'re looking kind of thoughtful,\" he remarked as they started\\noff. \"Did the old guy say anything more?\"\\nTuppence opened her mouth impulsively, and then shut it again.\\nSir James\\'s words sounded in her ears: \"Never tell all you\\nknow--not even to the person you know best.\" And like a flash\\nthere came into her mind another memory. Julius before the safe\\nin the flat, her own question and the pause before his reply,\\n\"Nothing.\" Was there really nothing? Or had he found something\\nhe wished to keep to himself? If he could make a reservation, so\\ncould she.\\n\"Nothing particular,\" she replied.\\nShe felt rather than saw Julius throw a sideways glance at her.\\n\"Say, shall we go for a spin in the park?\"\\n\"If you like.\"\\nFor a while they ran on under the trees in silence. It was a\\nbeautiful day. The keen rush through the air brought a new\\nexhilaration to Tuppence.\\n\"Say, Miss Tuppence, do you think I\\'m ever going to find Jane?\"\\nJulius spoke in a discouraged voice. The mood was so alien to\\nhim that Tuppence turned and stared at him in surprise. He\\nnodded.\\n\"That\\'s so. I\\'m getting down and out over the business. Sir\\nJames to-day hadn\\'t got any hope at all, I could see that. I\\ndon\\'t like him--we don\\'t gee together somehow--but he\\'s pretty\\ncute, and I guess he wouldn\\'t quit if there was any chance of\\nsuccess--now, would he?\"\\nTuppence felt rather uncomfortable, but clinging to her belief\\nthat Julius also had withheld something from her, she remained\\nfirm.\\n\"He suggested advertising for the nurse,\" she reminded him.\\n\"Yes, with a \\'forlorn hope\\' flavour to his voice! No--I\\'m about\\nfed up. I\\'ve half a mind to go back to the States right away.\"\\n\"Oh no!\" cried Tuppence. \"We\\'ve got to find Tommy.\"\\n\"I sure forgot Beresford,\" said Julius contritely. \"That\\'s so.\\nWe must find him. But after--well, I\\'ve been day-dreaming ever\\nsince I started on this trip--and these dreams are rotten poor\\nbusiness. I\\'m quit of them. Say, Miss Tuppence, there\\'s\\nsomething I\\'d like to ask you.\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"You and Beresford. What about it?\"\\n\"I don\\'t understand you,\" replied Tuppence with dignity, adding\\nrather inconsequently: \"And, anyway, you\\'re wrong!\"\\n\"Not got a sort of kindly feeling for one another?\"\\n\"Certainly not,\" said Tuppence with warmth. \"Tommy and I are\\nfriends--nothing more.\"\\n\"I guess every pair of lovers has said that sometime or another,\"\\nobserved Julius.\\n\"Nonsense!\" snapped Tuppence. \"Do I look the sort of girl that\\'s\\nalways falling in love with every man she meets?\"\\n\"You do not. You look the sort of girl that\\'s mighty often\\ngetting fallen in love with!\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence, rather taken aback. \"That\\'s a compliment, I\\nsuppose?\"\\n\"Sure. Now let\\'s get down to this. Supposing we never find\\nBeresford and--and----\"\\n\"All right--say it! I can face facts. Supposing he\\'s--dead!\\nWell?\"\\n\"And all this business fiddles out. What are you going to do?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Tuppence forlornly.\\n\"You\\'ll be darned lonesome, you poor kid.\"\\n\"I shall be all right,\" snapped Tuppence with her usual\\nresentment of any kind of pity.\\n\"What about marriage?\" inquired Julius. \"Got any views on the\\nsubject?\"\\n\"I intend to marry, of course,\" replied Tuppence. \"That is,\\nif\"--she paused, knew a momentary longing to draw back, and then\\nstuck to her guns bravely--\"I can find some one rich enough to\\nmake it worth my while. That\\'s frank, isn\\'t it? I dare say you\\ndespise me for it.\"\\n\"I never despise business instinct,\" said Julius. \"What\\nparticular figure have you in mind?\"\\n\"Figure?\" asked Tuppence, puzzled. \"Do you mean tall or short?\"\\n\"No. Sum--income.\"\\n\"Oh, I--I haven\\'t quite worked that out.\"\\n\"What about me?\"\\n\"You?\"\\n\"Sure thing.\"\\n\"Oh, I couldn\\'t!\"\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\"I tell you I couldn\\'t.\"\\n\"Again, why not?\"\\n\"It would seem so unfair.\"\\n\"I don\\'t see anything unfair about it. I call your bluff, that\\'s\\nall. I admire you immensely, Miss Tuppence, more than any girl\\nI\\'ve ever met. You\\'re so darned plucky. I\\'d just love to give\\nyou a real, rattling good time. Say the word, and we\\'ll run\\nround right away to some high-class jeweller, and fix up the ring\\nbusiness.\"\\n\"I can\\'t,\" gasped Tuppence.\\n\"Because of Beresford?\"\\n\"No, no, NO!\"\\n\"Well then?\"\\nTuppence merely continued to shake her head violently.\\n\"You can\\'t reasonably expect more dollars than I\\'ve got.\"\\n\"Oh, it isn\\'t that,\" gasped Tuppence with an almost hysterical\\nlaugh. \"But thanking you very much, and all that, I think I\\'d\\nbetter say no.\"\\n\"I\\'d be obliged if you\\'d do me the favour to think it over until\\nto-morrow.\"\\n\"It\\'s no use.\"\\n\"Still, I guess we\\'ll leave it like that.\"\\n\"Very well,\" said Tuppence meekly.\\nNeither of them spoke again until they reached the Ritz.\\nTuppence went upstairs to her room. She felt morally battered to\\nthe ground after her conflict with Julius\\'s vigorous personality.\\nSitting down in front of the glass, she stared at her own\\nreflection for some minutes.\\n\"Fool,\" murmured Tuppence at length, making a grimace. \"Little\\nfool. Everything you want--everything you\\'ve ever hoped for, and\\nyou go and bleat out \\'no\\' like an idiotic little sheep. It\\'s your\\none chance. Why don\\'t you take it? Grab it? Snatch at it? What\\nmore do you want?\"\\nAs if in answer to her own question, her eyes fell on a small\\nsnapshot of Tommy that stood on her dressing-table in a shabby\\nframe. For a moment she struggled for self-control, and then\\nabandoning all presence, she held it to her lips and burst into a\\nfit of sobbing.\\n\"Oh, Tommy, Tommy,\" she cried, \"I do love you so--and I may never\\nsee you again....\"\\nAt the end of five minutes Tuppence sat up, blew her nose, and\\npushed back her hair.\\n\"That\\'s that,\" she observed sternly. \"Let\\'s look facts in the\\nface. I seem to have fallen in love--with an idiot of a boy who\\nprobably doesn\\'t care two straws about me.\" Here she paused.\\n\"Anyway,\" she resumed, as though arguing with an unseen opponent,\\n\"I don\\'t KNOW that he does. He\\'d never have dared to say so.\\nI\\'ve always jumped on sentiment--and here I am being more\\nsentimental than anybody. What idiots girls are! I\\'ve always\\nthought so. I suppose I shall sleep with his photograph under my\\npillow, and dream about him all night. It\\'s dreadful to feel\\nyou\\'ve been false to your principles.\"\\nTuppence shook her head sadly, as she reviewed her backsliding.\\n\"I don\\'t know what to say to Julius, I\\'m sure. Oh, what a fool I\\nfeel! I\\'ll have to say SOMETHING--he\\'s so American and thorough,\\nhe\\'ll insist upon having a reason. I wonder if he did find\\nanything in that safe----\"\\nTuppence\\'s meditations went off on another tack. She reviewed\\nthe events of last night carefully and persistently. Somehow,\\nthey seemed bound up with Sir James\\'s enigmatical words....\\nSuddenly she gave a great start--the colour faded out of her\\nface. Her eyes, fascinated, gazed in front of her, the pupils\\ndilated.\\n\"Impossible,\" she murmured. \"Impossible! I must be going mad\\neven to think of such a thing....\"\\nMonstrous--yet it explained everything....\\nAfter a moment\\'s reflection she sat down and wrote a note,\\nweighing each word as she did so. Finally she nodded her head as\\nthough satisfied, and slipped it into an envelope which she\\naddressed to Julius. She went down the passage to his\\nsitting-room and knocked at the door. As she had expected, the\\nroom was empty. She left the note on the table.\\nA small page-boy was waiting outside her own door when she\\nreturned to it.\\n\"Telegram for you, miss.\"\\nTuppence took it from the salver, and tore it open carelessly.\\nThen she gave a cry. The telegram was from Tommy!\\nCHAPTER XVI\\nFURTHER ADVENTURES OF TOMMY\\nFROM a darkness punctuated with throbbing stabs of fire, Tommy\\ndragged his senses slowly back to life. When he at last opened\\nhis eyes, he was conscious of nothing but an excruciating pain\\nthrough his temples. He was vaguely aware of unfamiliar\\nsurroundings. Where was he? What had happened? He blinked\\nfeebly. This was not his bedroom at the Ritz. And what the\\ndevil was the matter with his head?\\n\"Damn!\" said Tommy, and tried to sit up. He had remembered. He\\nwas in that sinister house in Soho. He uttered a groan and fell\\nback. Through his almost-closed lids he reconnoitred carefully.\\n\"He is coming to,\" remarked a voice very near Tommy\\'s ear. He\\nrecognized it at once for that of the bearded and efficient\\nGerman, and lay artistically inert. He felt that it would be a\\npity to come round too soon; and until the pain in his head\\nbecame a little less acute, he felt quite incapable of collecting\\nhis wits. Painfully he tried to puzzle out what had happened.\\nObviously somebody must have crept up behind him as he listened\\nand struck him down with a blow on the head. They knew him now\\nfor a spy, and would in all probability give him short shrift.\\nUndoubtedly he was in a tight place. Nobody knew where he was,\\ntherefore he need expect no outside assistance, and must depend\\nsolely on his own wits.\\n\"Well, here goes,\" murmured Tommy to himself, and repeated his\\nformer remark.\\n\"Damn!\" he observed, and this time succeeded in sitting up.\\nIn a minute the German stepped forward and placed a glass to his\\nlips, with the brief command \"Drink.\" Tommy obeyed. The potency\\nof the draught made him choke, but it cleared his brain in a\\nmarvellous manner.\\nHe was lying on a couch in the room in which the meeting had been\\nheld. On one side of him was the German, on the other the\\nvillainous-faced doorkeeper who had let him in. The others were\\ngrouped together at a little distance away. But Tommy missed one\\nface. The man known as Number One was no longer of the company.\\n\"Feel better?\" asked the German, as he removed the empty glass.\\n\"Yes, thanks,\" returned Tommy cheerfully.\\n\"Ah, my young friend, it is lucky for you your skull is so thick.\\nThe good Conrad struck hard.\" He indicated the evil-faced\\ndoorkeeper by a nod. The man grinned.\\nTommy twisted his head round with an effort.\\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"so you\\'re Conrad, are you? It strikes me the\\nthickness of my skull was lucky for you too. When I look at you I\\nfeel it\\'s almost a pity I\\'ve enabled you to cheat the hangman.\"\\nThe man snarled, and the bearded man said quietly:\\n\"He would have run no risk of that.\"\\n\"Just as you like,\" replied Tommy. \"I know it\\'s the fashion to\\nrun down the police. I rather believe in them myself.\"\\nHis manner was nonchalant to the last degree. Tommy Beresford\\nwas one of those young Englishmen not distinguished by any\\nspecial intellectual ability, but who are emphatically at their\\nbest in what is known as a \"tight place.\" Their natural\\ndiffidence and caution fall from them like a glove. Tommy\\nrealized perfectly that in his own wits lay the only chance of\\nescape, and behind his casual manner he was racking his brains\\nfuriously.\\nThe cold accents of the German took up the conversation:\\n\"Have you anything to say before you are put to death as a spy?\"\\n\"Simply lots of things,\" replied Tommy with the same urbanity as\\nbefore.\\n\"Do you deny that you were listening at that door?\"\\n\"I do not. I must really apologize--but your conversation was so\\ninteresting that it overcame my scruples.\"\\n\"How did you get in?\"\\n\"Dear old Conrad here.\" Tommy smiled deprecatingly at him. \"I\\nhesitate to suggest pensioning off a faithful servant, but you\\nreally ought to have a better watchdog.\"\\nConrad snarled impotently, and said sullenly, as the man with the\\nbeard swung round upon him:\\n\"He gave the word. How was I to know?\"\\n\"Yes,\" Tommy chimed in. \"How was he to know? Don\\'t blame the\\npoor fellow. His hasty action has given me the pleasure of seeing\\nyou all face to face.\"\\nHe fancied that his words caused some discomposure among the\\ngroup, but the watchful German stilled it with a wave of his\\nhand.\\n\"Dead men tell no tales,\" he said evenly.\\n\"Ah,\" said Tommy, \"but I\\'m not dead yet!\"\\n\"You soon will be, my young friend,\" said the German.\\nAn assenting murmur came from the others.\\nTommy\\'s heart beat faster, but his casual pleasantness did not\\nwaver.\\n\"I think not,\" he said firmly. \"I should have a great objection\\nto dying.\"\\nHe had got them puzzled, he saw that by the look on his captor\\'s\\nface.\\n\"Can you give us any reason why we should not put you to death?\"\\nasked the German.\\n\"Several,\" replied Tommy. \"Look here, you\\'ve been asking me a\\nlot of questions. Let me ask you one for a change. Why didn\\'t\\nyou kill me off at once before I regained consciousness?\"\\nThe German hesitated, and Tommy seized his advantage.\\n\"Because you didn\\'t know how much I knew--and where I obtained\\nthat knowledge. If you kill me now, you never will know.\"\\nBut here the emotions of Boris became too much for him. He\\nstepped forward waving his arms.\\n\"You hell-hound of a spy,\" he screamed. \"We will give you short\\nshrift. Kill him! Kill him!\"\\nThere was a roar of applause.\\n\"You hear?\" said the German, his eyes on Tommy. \"What have you\\nto say to that?\"\\n\"Say?\" Tommy shrugged his shoulders. \"Pack of fools. Let them\\nask themselves a few questions. How did I get into this place?\\nRemember what dear old Conrad said--WITH YOUR OWN PASSWORD,\\nwasn\\'t it? How did I get hold of that? You don\\'t suppose I came\\nup those steps haphazard and said the first thing that came into\\nmy head?\"\\nTommy was pleased with the concluding words of this speech. His\\nonly regret was that Tuppence was not present to appreciate its\\nfull flavour.\\n\"That is true,\" said the working man suddenly. \"Comrades, we\\nhave been betrayed!\"\\nAn ugly murmur arose. Tommy smiled at them encouragingly.\\n\"That\\'s better. How can you hope to make a success of any job if\\nyou don\\'t use your brains?\"\\n\"You will tell us who has betrayed us,\" said the German. \"But\\nthat shall not save you--oh, no! You shall tell us all that you\\nknow. Boris, here, knows pretty ways of making people speak!\"\\n\"Bah!\" said Tommy scornfully, fighting down a singularly\\nunpleasant feeling in the pit of his stomach. \"You will neither\\ntorture me nor kill me.\"\\n\"And why not?\" asked Boris.\\n\"Because you\\'d kill the goose that lays the golden eggs,\" replied\\nTommy quietly.\\nThere was a momentary pause. It seemed as though Tommy\\'s\\npersistent assurance was at last conquering. They were no longer\\ncompletely sure of themselves. The man in the shabby clothes\\nstared at Tommy searchingly.\\n\"He\\'s bluffing you, Boris,\" he said quietly.\\nTommy hated him. Had the man seen through him?\\nThe German, with an effort, turned roughly to Tommy.\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\"What do you think I mean?\" parried Tommy, searching desperately\\nin his own mind.\\nSuddenly Boris stepped forward, and shook his fist in Tommy\\'s\\nface.\\n\"Speak, you swine of an Englishman--speak!\"\\n\"Don\\'t get so excited, my good fellow,\" said Tommy calmly.\\n\"That\\'s the worst of you foreigners. You can\\'t keep calm. Now, I\\nask you, do I look as though I thought there were the least\\nchance of your killing me?\"\\nHe looked confidently round, and was glad they could not hear the\\npersistent beating of his heart which gave the lie to his words.\\n\"No,\" admitted Boris at last sullenly, \"you do not.\"\\n\"Thank God, he\\'s not a mind reader,\" thought Tommy. Aloud he\\npursued his advantage:\\n\"And why am I so confident? Because I know something that puts\\nme in a position to propose a bargain.\"\\n\"A bargain?\" The bearded man took him up sharply.\\n\"Yes--a bargain. My life and liberty against----\" He paused.\\n\"Against what?\"\\nThe group pressed forward. You could have heard a pin drop.\\nSlowly Tommy spoke.\\n\"The papers that Danvers brought over from America in the\\nLusitania.\"\\nThe effect of his words was electrical. Every one was on his\\nfeet. The German waved them back. He leaned over Tommy, his face\\npurple with excitement.\\n\"Himmel! You have got them, then?\"\\nWith magnificent calm Tommy shook his head.\\n\"You know where they are?\" persisted the German.\\nAgain Tommy shook his head. \"Not in the least.\"\\n\"Then--then----\" angry and baffled, the words failed him.\\nTommy looked round. He saw anger and bewilderment on every face,\\nbut his calm assurance had done its work--no one doubted but that\\nsomething lay behind his words.\\n\"I don\\'t know where the papers are--but I believe that I can find\\nthem. I have a theory----\"\\n\"Pah!\"\\nTommy raised his hand, and silenced the clamours of disgust.\\n\"I call it a theory--but I\\'m pretty sure of my facts--facts that\\nare known to no one but myself. In any case what do you lose? If\\nI can produce the papers--you give me my life and liberty in\\nexchange. Is it a bargain?\"\\n\"And if we refuse?\" said the German quietly.\\nTommy lay back on the couch.\\n\"The 29th,\" he said thoughtfully, \"is less than a fortnight\\nahead----\"\\nFor a moment the German hesitated. Then he made a sign to\\nConrad.\\n\"Take him into the other room.\"\\nFor five minutes, Tommy sat on the bed in the dingy room next\\ndoor. His heart was beating violently. He had risked all on this\\nthrow. How would they decide? And all the while that this\\nagonized questioning went on within him, he talked flippantly to\\nConrad, enraging the cross-grained doorkeeper to the point of\\nhomicidal mania.\\nAt last the door opened, and the German called imperiously to\\nConrad to return.\\n\"Let\\'s hope the judge hasn\\'t put his black cap on,\" remarked\\nTommy frivolously. \"That\\'s right, Conrad, march me in. The\\nprisoner is at the bar, gentlemen.\"\\nThe German was seated once more behind the table. He motioned to\\nTommy to sit down opposite to him.\\n\"We accept,\" he said harshly, \"on terms. The papers must be\\ndelivered to us before you go free.\"\\n\"Idiot!\" said Tommy amiably. \"How do you think I can look for\\nthem if you keep me tied by the leg here?\"\\n\"What do you expect, then?\"\\n\"I must have liberty to go about the business in my own way.\"\\nThe German laughed.\\n\"Do you think we are little children to let you walk out of here\\nleaving us a pretty story full of promises?\"\\n\"No,\" said Tommy thoughtfully. \"Though infinitely simpler for\\nme, I did not really think you would agree to that plan. Very\\nwell, we must arrange a compromise. How would it be if you\\nattached little Conrad here to my person. He\\'s a faithful fellow,\\nand very ready with the fist.\"\\n\"We prefer,\" said the German coldly, \"that you should remain\\nhere. One of our number will carry out your instructions\\nminutely. If the operations are complicated, he will return to\\nyou with a report and you can instruct him further.\"\\n\"You\\'re tying my hands,\" complained Tommy. \"It\\'s a very delicate\\naffair, and the other fellow will muff it up as likely as not,\\nand then where shall I be? I don\\'t believe one of you has got an\\nounce of tact.\"\\nThe German rapped the table.\\n\"Those are our terms. Otherwise, death!\"\\nTommy leaned back wearily.\\n\"I like your style. Curt, but attractive. So be it, then. But\\none thing is essential, I must see the girl.\"\\n\"What girl?\"\\n\"Jane Finn, of course.\"\\nThe other looked at him curiously for some minutes, then he said\\nslowly, and as though choosing his words with care:\\n\"Do you not know that she can tell you nothing?\"\\nTommy\\'s heart beat a little faster. Would he succeed in coming\\nface to face with the girl he was seeking?\\n\"I shall not ask her to tell me anything,\" he said quietly. \"Not\\nin so many words, that is.\"\\n\"Then why see her?\"\\nTommy paused.\\n\"To watch her face when I ask her one question,\" he replied at\\nlast.\\nAgain there was a look in the German\\'s eyes that Tommy did not\\nquite understand.\\n\"She will not be able to answer your question.\"\\n\"That does not matter. I shall have seen her face when I ask it.\"\\n\"And you think that will tell you anything?\" He gave a short\\ndisagreeable laugh. More than ever, Tommy felt that there was a\\nfactor somewhere that he did not understand. The German looked at\\nhim searchingly. \"I wonder whether, after all, you know as much\\nas we think?\" he said softly.\\nTommy felt his ascendancy less sure than a moment before. His\\nhold had slipped a little. But he was puzzled. What had he said\\nwrong? He spoke out on the impulse of the moment.\\n\"There may be things that you know which I do not. I have not\\npretended to be aware of all the details of your show. But\\nequally I\\'ve got something up my sleeve that you don\\'t know\\nabout. And that\\'s where I mean to score. Danvers was a damned\\nclever fellow----\" He broke off as if he had said too much.\\nBut the German\\'s face had lightened a little.\\n\"Danvers,\" he murmured. \"I see----\" He paused a minute, then\\nwaved to Conrad. \"Take him away. Upstairs--you know.\"\\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Tommy. \"What about the girl?\"\\n\"That may perhaps be arranged.\"\\n\"It must be.\"\\n\"We will see about it. Only one person can decide that.\"\\n\"Who?\" asked Tommy. But he knew the answer.\\n\"Mr. Brown----\"\\n\"Shall I see him?\"\\n\"Perhaps.\"\\n\"Come,\" said Conrad harshly.\\nTommy rose obediently. Outside the door his gaoler motioned to\\nhim to mount the stairs. He himself followed close behind. On\\nthe floor above Conrad opened a door and Tommy passed into a\\nsmall room. Conrad lit a hissing gas burner and went out. Tommy\\nheard the sound of the key being turned in the lock.\\nHe set to work to examine his prison. It was a smaller room than\\nthe one downstairs, and there was something peculiarly airless\\nabout the atmosphere of it. Then he realized that there was no\\nwindow. He walked round it. The walls were filthily dirty, as\\neverywhere else. Four pictures hung crookedly on the wall\\nrepresenting scenes from Faust. Marguerite with her box of\\njewels, the church scene, Siebel and his flowers, and Faust and\\nMephistopheles. The latter brought Tommy\\'s mind back to Mr.\\nBrown again. In this sealed and closed chamber, with its\\nclose-fitting heavy door, he felt cut off from the world, and the\\nsinister power of the arch-criminal seemed more real. Shout as\\nhe would, no one could ever hear him. The place was a living\\ntomb....\\nWith an effort Tommy pulled himself together. He sank on to the\\nbed and gave himself up to reflection. His head ached badly;\\nalso, he was hungry. The silence of the place was dispiriting.\\n\"Anyway,\" said Tommy, trying to cheer himself, \"I shall see the\\nchief--the mysterious Mr. Brown and with a bit of luck in\\nbluffing I shall see the mysterious Jane Finn also. After\\nthat----\"\\nAfter that Tommy was forced to admit the prospect looked dreary.\\nCHAPTER XVII\\nANNETTE\\nTHE troubles of the future, however, soon faded before the\\ntroubles of the present. And of these, the most immediate and\\npressing was that of hunger. Tommy had a healthy and vigorous\\nappetite. The steak and chips partaken of for lunch seemed now to\\nbelong to another decade. He regretfully recognized the fact\\nthat he would not make a success of a hunger strike.\\nHe prowled aimlessly about his prison. Once or twice he\\ndiscarded dignity, and pounded on the door. But nobody answered\\nthe summons.\\n\"Hang it all!\" said Tommy indignantly. \"They can\\'t mean to\\nstarve me to death.\" A new-born fear passed through his mind\\nthat this might, perhaps, be one of those \"pretty ways\" of making\\na prisoner speak, which had been attributed to Boris. But on\\nreflection he dismissed the idea.\\n\"It\\'s that sour faced brute Conrad,\" he decided. \"That\\'s a\\nfellow I shall enjoy getting even with one of these days. This is\\njust a bit of spite on his part. I\\'m certain of it.\"\\nFurther meditations induced in him the feeling that it would be\\nextremely pleasant to bring something down with a whack on\\nConrad\\'s egg-shaped head. Tommy stroked his own head tenderly,\\nand gave himself up to the pleasures of imagination. Finally a\\nbright idea flashed across his brain. Why not convert imagination\\ninto reality? Conrad was undoubtedly the tenant of the house.\\nThe others, with the possible exception of the bearded German,\\nmerely used it as a rendezvous. Therefore, why not wait in\\nambush for Conrad behind the door, and when he entered bring down\\na chair, or one of the decrepit pictures, smartly on to his head.\\nOne would, of course, be careful not to hit too hard. And\\nthen--and then, simply walk out! If he met anyone on the way\\ndown, well----Tommy brightened at the thought of an encounter\\nwith his fists. Such an affair was infinitely more in his line\\nthan the verbal encounter of this afternoon. Intoxicated by his\\nplan, Tommy gently unhooked the picture of the Devil and Faust,\\nand settled himself in position. His hopes were high. The plan\\nseemed to him simple but excellent.\\nTime went on, but Conrad did not appear. Night and day were the\\nsame in this prison room, but Tommy\\'s wrist-watch, which enjoyed\\na certain degree of accuracy, informed him that it was nine\\no\\'clock in the evening. Tommy reflected gloomily that if supper\\ndid not arrive soon it would be a question of waiting for\\nbreakfast. At ten o\\'clock hope deserted him, and he flung\\nhimself on the bed to seek consolation in sleep. In five minutes\\nhis woes were forgotten.\\nThe sound of the key turning in the lock awoke him from his\\nslumbers. Not belonging to the type of hero who is famous for\\nawaking in full possession of his faculties, Tommy merely blinked\\nat the ceiling and wondered vaguely where he was. Then he\\nremembered, and looked at his watch. It was eight o\\'clock.\\n\"It\\'s either early morning tea or breakfast,\" deduced the young\\nman, \"and pray God it\\'s the latter!\"\\nThe door swung open. Too late, Tommy remembered his scheme of\\nobliterating the unprepossessing Conrad. A moment later he was\\nglad that he had, for it was not Conrad who entered, but a girl.\\nShe carried a tray which she set down on the table.\\nIn the feeble light of the gas burner Tommy blinked at her. He\\ndecided at once that she was one of the most beautiful girls he\\nhad ever seen. Her hair was a full rich brown, with sudden glints\\nof gold in it as though there were imprisoned sunbeams struggling\\nin its depths. There was a wild-rose quality about her face. Her\\neyes, set wide apart, were hazel, a golden hazel that again\\nrecalled a memory of sunbeams.\\nA delirious thought shot through Tommy\\'s mind.\\n\"Are you Jane Finn?\" he asked breathlessly.\\nThe girl shook her head wonderingly.\\n\"My name is Annette, monsieur.\"\\nShe spoke in a soft, broken English.\\n\"Oh!\" said Tommy, rather taken aback. \"Francaise?\" he hazarded.\\n\"Oui, monsieur. Monsieur parle francais?\"\\n\"Not for any length of time,\" said Tommy. \"What\\'s that?\\nBreakfast?\"\\nThe girl nodded. Tommy dropped off the bed and came and\\ninspected the contents of the tray. It consisted of a loaf, some\\nmargarine, and a jug of coffee.\\n\"The living is not equal to the Ritz,\" he observed with a sigh.\\n\"But for what we are at last about to receive the Lord has made\\nme truly thankful. Amen.\"\\nHe drew up a chair, and the girl turned away to the door.\\n\"Wait a sec,\" cried Tommy. \"There are lots of things I want to\\nask you, Annette. What are you doing in this house? Don\\'t tell\\nme you\\'re Conrad\\'s niece, or daughter, or anything, because I\\ncan\\'t believe it.\"\\n\"I do the SERVICE, monsieur. I am not related to anybody.\"\\n\"I see,\" said Tommy. \"You know what I asked you just now. Have\\nyou ever heard that name?\"\\n\"I have heard people speak of Jane Finn, I think.\"\\n\"You don\\'t know where she is?\"\\nAnnette shook her head.\\n\"She\\'s not in this house, for instance?\"\\n\"Oh no, monsieur. I must go now--they will be waiting for me.\"\\nShe hurried out. The key turned in the lock.\\n\"I wonder who \\'they\\' are,\" mused Tommy, as he continued to make\\ninroads on the loaf. \"With a bit of luck, that girl might help\\nme to get out of here. She doesn\\'t look like one of the gang.\"\\nAt one o\\'clock Annette reappeared with another tray, but this\\ntime Conrad accompanied her.\\n\"Good morning,\" said Tommy amiably. \"You have NOT used Pear\\'s\\nsoap, I see.\"\\nConrad growled threateningly.\\n\"No light repartee, have you, old bean? There, there, we can\\'t\\nalways have brains as well as beauty. What have we for lunch?\\nStew? How did I know? Elementary, my dear Watson--the smell of\\nonions is unmistakable.\"\\n\"Talk away,\" grunted the man. \"It\\'s little enough time you\\'ll\\nhave to talk in, maybe.\"\\nThe remark was unpleasant in its suggestion, but Tommy ignored\\nit. He sat down at the table.\\n\"Retire, varlet,\" he said, with a wave of his hand. \"Prate not to\\nthy betters.\"\\nThat evening Tommy sat on the bed, and cogitated deeply. Would\\nConrad again accompany the girl? If he did not, should he risk\\ntrying to make an ally of her? He decided that he must leave no\\nstone unturned. His position was desperate.\\nAt eight o\\'clock the familiar sound of the key turning made him\\nspring to his feet. The girl was alone.\\n\"Shut the door,\" he commanded. \"I want to speak to you.\" She\\nobeyed.\\n\"Look here, Annette, I want you to help me get out of this.\" She\\nshook her head.\\n\"Impossible. There are three of them on the floor below.\"\\n\"Oh!\" Tommy was secretly grateful for the information. \"But you\\nwould help me if you could?\"\\n\"No, monsieur.\"\\n\"Why not?\"\\nThe girl hesitated.\\n\"I think--they are my own people. You have spied upon them. They\\nare quite right to keep you here.\"\\n\"They\\'re a bad lot, Annette. If you\\'ll help me, I\\'ll take you\\naway from the lot of them. And you\\'d probably get a good whack\\nof money.\"\\nBut the girl merely shook her head.\\n\"I dare not, monsieur; I am afraid of them.\"\\nShe turned away.\\n\"Wouldn\\'t you do anything to help another girl?\" cried Tommy.\\n\"She\\'s about your age too. Won\\'t you save her from their\\nclutches?\"\\n\"You mean Jane Finn?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"It is her you came here to look for? Yes?\"\\n\"That\\'s it.\"\\nThe girl looked at him, then passed her hand across her forehead.\\n\"Jane Finn. Always I hear that name. It is familiar.\"\\nTommy came forward eagerly.\\n\"You must know SOMETHING about her?\"\\nBut the girl turned away abruptly.\\n\"I know nothing--only the name.\" She walked towards the door.\\nSuddenly she uttered a cry. Tommy stared. She had caught sight\\nof the picture he had laid against the wall the night before. For\\na moment he caught a look of terror in her eyes. As inexplicably\\nit changed to relief. Then abruptly she went out of the room.\\nTommy could make nothing of it. Did she fancy that he had meant\\nto attack her with it? Surely not. He rehung the picture on the\\nwall thoughtfully.\\nThree more days went by in dreary inaction. Tommy felt the\\nstrain telling on his nerves. He saw no one but Conrad and\\nAnnette, and the girl had become dumb. She spoke only in\\nmonosyllables. A kind of dark suspicion smouldered in her eyes.\\nTommy felt that if this solitary confinement went on much longer\\nhe would go mad. He gathered from Conrad that they were waiting\\nfor orders from \"Mr. Brown.\" Perhaps, thought Tommy, he was\\nabroad or away, and they were obliged to wait for his return.\\nBut the evening of the third day brought a rude awakening.\\nIt was barely seven o\\'clock when he heard the tramp of footsteps\\noutside in the passage. In another minute the door was flung\\nopen. Conrad entered. With him was the evil-looking Number 14.\\nTommy\\'s heart sank at the sight of them.\\n\"Evenin\\', gov\\'nor,\" said the man with a leer. \"Got those ropes,\\nmate?\"\\nThe silent Conrad produced a length of fine cord. The next\\nminute Number 14\\'s hands, horribly dexterous, were winding the\\ncord round his limbs, while Conrad held him down.\\n\"What the devil----?\" began Tommy.\\nBut the slow, speechless grin of the silent Conrad froze the\\nwords on his lips.\\nNumber 14 proceeded deftly with his task. In another minute\\nTommy was a mere helpless bundle. Then at last Conrad spoke:\\n\"Thought you\\'d bluffed us, did you? With what you knew, and what\\nyou didn\\'t know. Bargained with us! And all the time it was\\nbluff! Bluff! You know less than a kitten. But your number\\'s up\\nnow all right, you b----swine.\"\\nTommy lay silent. There was nothing to say. He had failed.\\nSomehow or other the omnipotent Mr. Brown had seen through his\\npretensions. Suddenly a thought occurred to him.\\n\"A very good speech, Conrad,\" he said approvingly. \"But wherefore\\nthe bonds and fetters? Why not let this kind gentleman here cut\\nmy throat without delay?\"\\n\"Garn,\" said Number 14 unexpectedly. \"Think we\\'re as green as to\\ndo you in here, and have the police nosing round? Not \\'alf!\\nWe\\'ve ordered the carriage for your lordship to-morrow mornin\\',\\nbut in the meantime we\\'re not taking any chances, see!\"\\n\"Nothing,\" said Tommy, \"could be plainer than your words--unless\\nit was your face.\"\\n\"Stow it,\" said Number 14.\\n\"With pleasure,\" replied Tommy. \"You\\'re making a sad\\nmistake--but yours will be the loss.\"\\n\"You don\\'t kid us that way again,\" said Number 14. \"Talking as\\nthough you were still at the blooming Ritz, aren\\'t you?\"\\nTommy made no reply. He was engaged in wondering how Mr. Brown\\nhad discovered his identity. He decided that Tuppence, in the\\nthroes of anxiety, had gone to the police, and that his\\ndisappearance having been made public the gang had not been slow\\nto put two and two together.\\nThe two men departed and the door slammed. Tommy was left to his\\nmeditations. They were not pleasant ones. Already his limbs felt\\ncramped and stiff. He was utterly helpless, and he could see no\\nhope anywhere.\\nAbout an hour had passed when he heard the key softly turned, and\\nthe door opened. It was Annette. Tommy\\'s heart beat a little\\nfaster. He had forgotten the girl. Was it possible that she had\\ncome to his help?\\nSuddenly he heard Conrad\\'s voice:\\n\"Come out of it, Annette. He doesn\\'t want any supper to-night.\"\\n\"Oui, oui, je sais bien. But I must take the other tray. We need\\nthe things on it.\"\\n\"Well, hurry up,\" growled Conrad.\\nWithout looking at Tommy the girl went over to the table, and\\npicked up the tray. She raised a hand and turned out the light.\\n\"Curse you\"--Conrad had come to the door--\"why did you do that?\"\\n\"I always turn it out. You should have told me. Shall I relight\\nit, Monsieur Conrad?\"\\n\"No, come on out of it.\"\\n\"Le beau petit monsieur,\" cried Annette, pausing by the bed in\\nthe darkness. \"You have tied him up well, hein? He is like a\\ntrussed chicken!\" The frank amusement in her tone jarred on the\\nboy; but at that moment, to his amazement, he felt her hand\\nrunning lightly over his bonds, and something small and cold was\\npressed into the palm of his hand.\\n\"Come on, Annette.\"\\n\"Mais me voila.\"\\nThe door shut. Tommy heard Conrad say:\\n\"Lock it and give me the key.\"\\nThe footsteps died away. Tommy lay petrified with amazement. The\\nobject Annette had thrust into his hand was a small penknife, the\\nblade open. From the way she had studiously avoided looking at\\nhim, and her action with the light, he came to the conclusion\\nthat the room was overlooked. There must be a peep-hole somewhere\\nin the walls. Remembering how guarded she had always been in her\\nmanner, he saw that he had probably been under observation all\\nthe time. Had he said anything to give himself away? Hardly. He\\nhad revealed a wish to escape and a desire to find Jane Finn, but\\nnothing that could have given a clue to his own identity. True,\\nhis question to Annette had proved that he was personally\\nunacquainted with Jane Finn, but he had never pretended\\notherwise. The question now was, did Annette really know more?\\nWere her denials intended primarily for the listeners? On that\\npoint he could come to no conclusion.\\nBut there was a more vital question that drove out all others.\\nCould he, bound as he was, manage to cut his bonds? He essayed\\ncautiously to rub the open blade up and down on the cord that\\nbound his two wrists together. It was an awkward business, and\\ndrew a smothered \"Ow\" of pain from him as the knife cut into his\\nwrist. But slowly and doggedly he went on sawing to and fro. He\\ncut the flesh badly, but at last he felt the cord slacken. With\\nhis hands free, the rest was easy. Five minutes later he stood\\nupright with some difficulty, owing to the cramp in his limbs.\\nHis first care was to bind up his bleeding wrist. Then he sat on\\nthe edge of the bed to think. Conrad had taken the key of the\\ndoor, so he could expect little more assistance from Annette.\\nThe only outlet from the room was the door, consequently he would\\nperforce have to wait until the two men returned to fetch him.\\nBut when they did . . . Tommy smiled! Moving with infinite\\ncaution in the dark room, he found and unhooked the famous\\npicture. He felt an economical pleasure that his first plan would\\nnot be wasted. There was now nothing to do but to wait. He\\nwaited.\\nThe night passed slowly. Tommy lived through an eternity of\\nhours, but at last he heard footsteps. He stood upright, drew a\\ndeep breath, and clutched the picture firmly.\\nThe door opened. A faint light streamed in from outside. Conrad\\nwent straight towards the gas to light it. Tommy deeply regretted\\nthat it was he who had entered first. It would have been pleasant\\nto get even with Conrad. Number 14 followed. As he stepped\\nacross the threshold, Tommy brought the picture down with\\nterrific force on his head. Number 14 went down amidst a\\nstupendous crash of broken glass. In a minute Tommy had slipped\\nout and pulled to the door. The key was in the lock. He turned\\nit and withdrew it just as Conrad hurled himself against the door\\nfrom the inside with a volley of curses.\\nFor a moment Tommy hesitated. There was the sound of some one\\nstirring on the floor below. Then the German\\'s voice came up the\\nstairs.\\n\"Gott im Himmel! Conrad, what is it?\"\\nTommy felt a small hand thrust into his. Beside him stood\\nAnnette. She pointed up a rickety ladder that apparently led to\\nsome attics.\\n\"Quick--up here!\" She dragged him after her up the ladder. In\\nanother moment they were standing in a dusty garret littered with\\nlumber. Tommy looked round.\\n\"This won\\'t do. It\\'s a regular trap. There\\'s no way out.\"\\n\"Hush! Wait.\" The girl put her finger to her lips. She crept to\\nthe top of the ladder and listened.\\nThe banging and beating on the door was terrific. The German and\\nanother were trying to force the door in. Annette explained in a\\nwhisper:\\n\"They will think you are still inside. They cannot hear what\\nConrad says. The door is too thick.\"\\n\"I thought you could hear what went on in the room?\"\\n\"There is a peep-hole into the next room. It was clever of you\\nto guess. But they will not think of that--they are only anxious\\nto get in.\"\\n\"Yes--but look here----\"\\n\"Leave it to me.\" She bent down. To his amazement, Tommy saw\\nthat she was fastening the end of a long piece of string to the\\nhandle of a big cracked jug. She arranged it carefully, then\\nturned to Tommy.\\n\"Have you the key of the door?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Give it to me.\"\\nHe handed it to her.\\n\"I am going down. Do you think you can go halfway, and then\\nswing yourself down BEHIND the ladder, so that they will not see\\nyou?\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"There\\'s a big cupboard in the shadow of the landing. Stand\\nbehind it. Take the end of this string in your hand. When I\\'ve\\nlet the others out--PULL!\"\\nBefore he had time to ask her anything more, she had flitted\\nlightly down the ladder and was in the midst of the group with a\\nloud cry:\\n\"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Qu\\'est-ce qu\\'il y a?\"\\nThe German turned on her with an oath.\\n\"Get out of this. Go to your room!\"\\nVery cautiously Tommy swung himself down the back of the ladder.\\nSo long as they did not turn round ... all was well. He crouched\\nbehind the cupboard. They were still between him and the stairs.\\n\"AH!\" Annette appeared to stumble over something. She stooped.\\n\"Mon Dieu, voila la clef!\"\\nThe German snatched it from her. He unlocked the door. Conrad\\nstumbled out, swearing.\\n\"Where is he? Have you got him?\"\\n\"We have seen no one,\" said the German sharply. His face paled.\\n\"Who do you mean?\"\\nConrad gave vent to another oath.\\n\"He\\'s got away.\"\\n\"Impossible. He would have passed us.\"\\nAt that moment, with an ecstatic smile Tommy pulled the string. A\\ncrash of crockery came from the attic above. In a trice the men\\nwere pushing each other up the rickety ladder and had disappeared\\ninto the darkness above.\\nQuick as a flash Tommy leapt from his hiding-place and dashed\\ndown the stairs, pulling the girl with him. There was no one in\\nthe hall. He fumbled over the bolts and chain. At last they\\nyielded, the door swung open. He turned. Annette had\\ndisappeared.\\nTommy stood spell-bound. Had she run upstairs again? What\\nmadness possessed her! He fumed with impatience, but he stood\\nhis ground. He would not go without her.\\nAnd suddenly there was an outcry overhead, an exclamation from\\nthe German, and then Annette\\'s voice, clear and high:\\n\"Ma foi, he has escaped! And quickly! Who would have thought\\nit?\"\\nTommy still stood rooted to the ground. Was that a command to\\nhim to go? He fancied it was.\\nAnd then, louder still, the words floated down to him:\\n\"This is a terrible house. I want to go back to Marguerite. To\\nMarguerite. TO MARGUERITE!\"\\nTommy had run back to the stairs. She wanted him to go and leave\\nher. But why? At all costs he must try and get her away with\\nhim. Then his heart sank. Conrad was leaping down the stairs,\\nuttering a savage cry at the sight of him. After him came the\\nothers.\\nTommy stopped Conrad\\'s rush with a straight blow with his fist.\\nIt caught the other on the point of the jaw and he fell like a\\nlog. The second man tripped over his body and fell. From higher\\nup the staircase there was a flash, and a bullet grazed Tommy\\'s\\near. He realized that it would be good for his health to get out\\nof this house as soon as possible. As regards Annette he could\\ndo nothing. He had got even with Conrad, which was one\\nsatisfaction. The blow had been a good one.\\nHe leapt for the door, slamming it behind him. The square was\\ndeserted. In front of the house was a baker\\'s van. Evidently he\\nwas to have been taken out of London in that, and his body found\\nmany miles from the house in Soho. The driver jumped to the\\npavement and tried to bar Tommy\\'s way. Again Tommy\\'s fist shot\\nout, and the driver sprawled on the pavement.\\nTommy took to his heels and ran--none too soon. The front door\\nopened and a hail of bullets followed him. Fortunately none of\\nthem hit him. He turned the corner of the square.\\n\"There\\'s one thing,\" he thought to himself, \"they can\\'t go on\\nshooting. They\\'ll have the police after them if they do. I\\nwonder they dared to there.\"\\nHe heard the footsteps of his pursuers behind him, and redoubled\\nhis own pace. Once he got out of these by-ways he would be safe.\\nThere would be a policeman about somewhere--not that he really\\nwanted to invoke the aid of the police if he could possibly do\\nwithout it. It meant explanations, and general awkwardness. In\\nanother moment he had reason to bless his luck. He stumbled over\\na prostrate figure, which started up with a yell of alarm and\\ndashed off down the street. Tommy drew back into a doorway. In a\\nminute he had the pleasure of seeing his two pursuers, of whom\\nthe German was one, industriously tracking down the red herring!\\nTommy sat down quietly on the doorstep and allowed a few moments\\nto elapse while he recovered his breath. Then he strolled gently\\nin the opposite direction. He glanced at his watch. It was a\\nlittle after half-past five. It was rapidly growing light. At\\nthe next corner he passed a policeman. The policeman cast a\\nsuspicious eye on him. Tommy felt slightly offended. Then,\\npassing his hand over his face, he laughed. He had not shaved or\\nwashed for three days! What a guy he must look.\\nHe betook himself without more ado to a Turkish Bath\\nestablishment which he knew to be open all night. He emerged into\\nthe busy daylight feeling himself once more, and able to make\\nplans.\\nFirst of all, he must have a square meal. He had eaten nothing\\nsince midday yesterday. He turned into an A.B.C. shop and\\nordered eggs and bacon and coffee. Whilst he ate, he read a\\nmorning paper propped up in front of him. Suddenly he stiffened.\\nThere was a long article on Kramenin, who was described as the\\n\"man behind Bolshevism\" in Russia, and who had just arrived in\\nLondon--some thought as an unofficial envoy. His career was\\nsketched lightly, and it was firmly asserted that he, and not the\\nfigurehead leaders, had been the author of the Russian\\nRevolution.\\nIn the centre of the page was his portrait.\\n\"So that\\'s who Number 1 is,\" said Tommy with his mouth full of\\neggs and bacon. \"Not a doubt about it, I must push on.\"\\nHe paid for his breakfast, and betook himself to Whitehall. There\\nhe sent up his name, and the message that it was urgent. A few\\nminutes later he was in the presence of the man who did not here\\ngo by the name of \"Mr. Carter.\" There was a frown on his face.\\n\"Look here, you\\'ve no business to come asking for me in this way.\\nI thought that was distinctly understood?\"\\n\"It was, sir. But I judged it important to lose no time.\"\\nAnd as briefly and succinctly as possible he detailed the\\nexperiences of the last few days.\\nHalf-way through, Mr. Carter interrupted him to give a few\\ncryptic orders through the telephone. All traces of displeasure\\nhad now left his face. He nodded energetically when Tommy had\\nfinished.\\n\"Quite right. Every moment\\'s of value. Fear we shall be too\\nlate anyway. They wouldn\\'t wait. Would clear out at once.\\nStill, they may have left something behind them that will be a\\nclue. You say you\\'ve recognized Number 1 to be Kramenin? That\\'s\\nimportant. We want something against him badly to prevent the\\nCabinet falling on his neck too freely. What about the others?\\nYou say two faces were familiar to you? One\\'s a Labour man, you\\nthink? Just look through these photos, and see if you can spot\\nhim.\"\\nA minute later, Tommy held one up. Mr. Carter exhibited some\\nsurprise.\\n\"Ah, Westway! Shouldn\\'t have thought it. Poses as being\\nmoderate. As for the other fellow, I think I can give a good\\nguess.\" He handed another photograph to Tommy, and smiled at the\\nother\\'s exclamation. \"I\\'m right, then. Who is he? Irishman.\\nProminent Unionist M.P. All a blind, of course. We\\'ve suspected\\nit--but couldn\\'t get any proof. Yes, you\\'ve done very well, young\\nman. The 29th, you say, is the date. That gives us very little\\ntime--very little time indeed.\"\\n\"But----\" Tommy hesitated.\\nMr. Carter read his thoughts.\\n\"We can deal with the General Strike menace, I think. It\\'s a\\ntoss-up--but we\\'ve got a sporting chance! But if that draft\\ntreaty turns up--we\\'re done. England will be plunged in anarchy.\\nAh, what\\'s that? The car? Come on, Beresford, we\\'ll go and have\\na look at this house of yours.\"\\nTwo constables were on duty in front of the house in Soho. An\\ninspector reported to Mr. Carter in a low voice. The latter\\nturned to Tommy.\\n\"The birds have flown--as we thought. We might as well go over\\nit.\"\\nGoing over the deserted house seemed to Tommy to partake of the\\ncharacter of a dream. Everything was just as it had been. The\\nprison room with the crooked pictures, the broken jug in the\\nattic, the meeting room with its long table. But nowhere was\\nthere a trace of papers. Everything of that kind had either been\\ndestroyed or taken away. And there was no sign of Annette.\\n\"What you tell me about the girl puzzled me,\" said Mr. Carter.\\n\"You believe that she deliberately went back?\"\\n\"It would seem so, sir. She ran upstairs while I was getting.\\nthe door open.\"\\n\"H\\'m, she must belong to the gang, then; but, being a woman,\\ndidn\\'t feel like standing by to see a personable young man\\nkilled. But evidently she\\'s in with them, or she wouldn\\'t have\\ngone back.\"\\n\"I can\\'t believe she\\'s really one of them, sir. She--seemed so\\ndifferent----\"\\n\"Good-looking, I suppose?\" said Mr. Carter with a smile that made\\nTommy flush to the roots of his hair. He admitted Annette\\'s\\nbeauty rather shamefacedly.\\n\"By the way,\" observed Mr. Carter, \"have you shown yourself to\\nMiss Tuppence yet? She\\'s been bombarding me with letters about\\nyou.\"\\n\"Tuppence? I was afraid she might get a bit rattled. Did she go\\nto the police?\"\\nMr. Carter shook his head.\\n\"Then I wonder how they twigged me.\"\\nMr. Carter looked inquiringly at him, and Tommy explained. The\\nother nodded thoughtfully.\\n\"True, that\\'s rather a curious point. Unless the mention of the\\nRitz was an accidental remark?\"\\n\"It might have been, sir. But they must have found out about me\\nsuddenly in some way.\"\\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Carter, looking round him, \"there\\'s nothing more\\nto be done here. What about some lunch with me?\"\\n\"Thanks awfully, sir. But I think I\\'d better get back and rout\\nout Tuppence.\"\\n\"Of course. Give her my kind regards and tell her not to believe\\nyou\\'re killed too readily next time.\"\\nTommy grinned.\\n\"I take a lot of killing, sir.\"\\n\"So I perceive,\" said Mr. Carter dryly. \"Well, good-bye.\\nRemember you\\'re a marked man now, and take reasonable care of\\nyourself.\"\\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\\nHailing a taxi briskly Tommy stepped in, and was swiftly borne to\\nthe Ritz\\' dwelling the while on the pleasurable anticipation of\\nstartling Tuppence.\\n\"Wonder what she\\'s been up to. Dogging \\'Rita\\' most likely. By\\nthe way, I suppose that\\'s who Annette meant by Marguerite. I\\ndidn\\'t get it at the time.\" The thought saddened him a little,\\nfor it seemed to prove that Mrs. Vandemeyer and the girl were on\\nintimate terms.\\nThe taxi drew up at the Ritz. Tommy burst into its sacred\\nportals eagerly, but his enthusiasm received a check. He was\\ninformed that Miss Cowley had gone out a quarter of an hour ago.\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\nTHE TELEGRAM\\nBAFFLED for the moment, Tommy strolled into the restaurant, and\\nordered a meal of surpassing excellence. His four days\\'\\nimprisonment had taught him anew to value good food.\\nHe was in the middle of conveying a particularly choice morsel of\\nSole a la Jeanette to his mouth, when he caught sight of Julius\\nentering the room. Tommy waved a menu cheerfully, and succeeded\\nin attracting the other\\'s attention. At the sight of Tommy,\\nJulius\\'s eyes seemed as though they would pop out of his head.\\nHe strode across, and pump-handled Tommy\\'s hand with what seemed\\nto the latter quite unnecessary vigour.\\n\"Holy snakes!\" he ejaculated. \"Is it really you?\"\\n\"Of course it is. Why shouldn\\'t it be?\"\\n\"Why shouldn\\'t it be? Say, man, don\\'t you know you\\'ve been given\\nup for dead? I guess we\\'d have had a solemn requiem for you in\\nanother few days.\"\\n\"Who thought I was dead?\" demanded Tommy.\\n\"Tuppence.\"\\n\"She remembered the proverb about the good dying young, I\\nsuppose. There must be a certain amount of original sin in me to\\nhave survived. Where is Tuppence, by the way?\"\\n\"Isn\\'t she here?\"\\n\"No, the fellows at the office said she\\'d just gone out.\"\\n\"Gone shopping, I guess. I dropped her here in the car about an\\nhour ago. But, say, can\\'t you shed that British calm of yours,\\nand get down to it? What on God\\'s earth have you been doing all\\nthis time?\"\\n\"If you\\'re feeding here,\" replied Tommy, \"order now. It\\'s going\\nto be a long story.\"\\nJulius drew up a chair to the opposite side of the table,\\nsummoned a hovering waiter, and dictated his wishes. Then he\\nturned to Tommy.\\n\"Fire ahead. I guess you\\'ve had some few adventures.\"\\n\"One or two,\" replied Tommy modestly, and plunged into his\\nrecital.\\nJulius listened spellbound. Half the dishes that were placed\\nbefore him he forgot to eat. At the end he heaved a long sigh.\\n\"Bully for you. Reads like a dime novel!\"\\n\"And now for the home front,\" said Tommy, stretching out his hand\\nfor a peach.\\n\"We-el,\" drawled Julius, \"I don\\'t mind admitting we\\'ve had some\\nadventures too.\"\\nHe, in his turn, assumed the role of narrator. Beginning with his\\nunsuccessful reconnoitring at Bournemouth, he passed on to his\\nreturn to London, the buying of the car, the growing anxieties of\\nTuppence, the call upon Sir James, and the sensational\\noccurrences of the previous night.\\n\"But who killed her?\" asked Tommy. \"I don\\'t quite understand.\"\\n\"The doctor kidded himself she took it herself,\" replied Julius\\ndryly.\\n\"And Sir James? What did he think?\"\\n\"Being a legal luminary, he is likewise a human oyster,\" replied\\nJulius. \"I should say he \\'reserved judgment.\\' \" He went on to\\ndetail the events of the morning.\\n\"Lost her memory, eh?\" said Tommy with interest. \"By Jove, that\\nexplains why they looked at me so queerly when I spoke of\\nquestioning her. Bit of a slip on my part, that! But it wasn\\'t\\nthe sort of thing a fellow would be likely to guess.\"\\n\"They didn\\'t give you any sort of hint as to where Jane was?\"\\nTommy shook his head regretfully.\\n\"Not a word. I\\'m a bit of an ass, as you know. I ought to have\\ngot more out of them somehow.\"\\n\"I guess you\\'re lucky to be here at all. That bluff of yours was\\nthe goods all right. How you ever came to think of it all so pat\\nbeats me to a frazzle!\"\\n\"I was in such a funk I had to think of something,\" said Tommy\\nsimply.\\nThere was a moment\\'s pause, and then Tommy reverted to Mrs.\\nVandemeyer\\'s death.\\n\"There\\'s no doubt it was chloral?\"\\n\"I believe not. At least they call it heart failure induced by\\nan overdose, or some such claptrap. It\\'s all right. We don\\'t\\nwant to be worried with an inquest. But I guess Tuppence and I\\nand even the highbrow Sir James have all got the same idea.\"\\n\"Mr. Brown?\" hazarded Tommy.\\n\"Sure thing.\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"All the same,\" he said thoughtfully, \"Mr. Brown hasn\\'t got\\nwings. I don\\'t see how he got in and out.\"\\n\"How about some high-class thought transference stunt? Some\\nmagnetic influence that irresistibly impelled Mrs. Vandemeyer to\\ncommit suicide?\"\\nTommy looked at him with respect.\\n\"Good, Julius. Distinctly good. Especially the phraseology. But\\nit leaves me cold. I yearn for a real Mr. Brown of flesh and\\nblood. I think the gifted young detectives must get to work,\\nstudy the entrances and exits, and tap the bumps on their\\nforeheads until the solution of the mystery dawns on them. Let\\'s\\ngo round to the scene of the crime. I wish we could get hold of\\nTuppence. The Ritz would enjoy the spectacle of the glad\\nreunion.\"\\nInquiry at the office revealed the fact that Tuppence had not yet\\nreturned.\\n\"All the same, I guess I\\'ll have a look round upstairs,\" said\\nJulius. \"She might be in my sitting-room.\" He disappeared.\\nSuddenly a diminutive boy spoke at Tommy\\'s elbow:\\n\"The young lady--she\\'s gone away by train, I think, sir,\" he\\nmurmured shyly.\\n\"What?\" Tommy wheeled round upon him.\\nThe small boy became pinker than before.\\n\"The taxi, sir. I heard her tell the driver Charing Cross and to\\nlook sharp.\"\\nTommy stared at him, his eyes opening wide in surprise.\\nEmboldened, the small boy proceeded. \"So I thought, having asked\\nfor an A.B.C. and a Bradshaw.\"\\nTommy interrupted him:\\n\"When did she ask for an A.B.C. and a Bradshaw?\"\\n\"When I took her the telegram, sir.\"\\n\"A telegram?\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\"When was that?\"\\n\"About half-past twelve, sir.\"\\n\"Tell me exactly what happened.\"\\nThe small boy drew a long breath.\\n\"I took up a telegram to No. 891--the lady was there. She opened\\nit and gave a gasp, and then she said, very jolly like: \\'Bring me\\nup a Bradshaw, and an A.B.C., and look sharp, Henry.\\' My name\\nisn\\'t Henry, but----\"\\n\"Never mind your name,\" said Tommy impatiently. \"Go on.\"\\n\"Yes, sir. I brought them, and she told me to wait, and looked\\nup something. And then she looks up at the clock, and \\'Hurry up,\\'\\nshe says. \\'Tell them to get me a taxi,\\' and she begins a-shoving\\non of her hat in front of the glass, and she was down in two\\nticks, almost as quick as I was, and I seed her going down the\\nsteps and into the taxi, and I heard her call out what I told\\nyou.\"\\nThe small boy stopped and replenished his lungs. Tommy continued\\nto stare at him. At that moment Julius rejoined him. He held an\\nopen letter in his hand.\\n\"I say, Hersheimmer\"--Tommy turned to him--\"Tuppence has gone off\\nsleuthing on her own.\"\\n\"Shucks!\"\\n\"Yes, she has. She went off in a taxi to Charing Cross in the\\ndeuce of a hurry after getting a telegram.\" His eye fell on the\\nletter in Julius\\'s hand. \"Oh; she left a note for you. That\\'s\\nall right. Where\\'s she off to?\"\\nAlmost unconsciously, he held out his hand for the letter, but\\nJulius folded it up and placed it in his pocket. He seemed a\\ntrifle embarrassed.\\n\"I guess this is nothing to do with it. It\\'s about something\\nelse--something I asked her that she was to let me know about.\"\\n\"Oh!\" Tommy looked puzzled, and seemed waiting for more.\\n\"See here,\" said Julius suddenly, \"I\\'d better put you wise. I\\nasked Miss Tuppence to marry me this morning.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tommy mechanically. He felt dazed. Julius\\'s words\\nwere totally unexpected. For the moment they benumbed his brain.\\n\"I\\'d like to tell you,\" continued Julius, \"that before I\\nsuggested anything of the kind to Miss Tuppence, I made it clear\\nthat I didn\\'t want to butt in in any way between her and you----\"\\nTommy roused himself.\\n\"That\\'s all right,\" he said quickly. \"Tuppence and I have been\\npals for years. Nothing more.\" He lit a cigarette with a hand\\nthat shook ever so little. \"That\\'s quite all right. Tuppence\\nalways said that she was looking out for----\"\\nHe stopped abruptly, his face crimsoning, but Julius was in no\\nway discomposed.\\n\"Oh, I guess it\\'ll be the dollars that\\'ll do the trick. Miss\\nTuppence put me wise to that right away. There\\'s no humbug about\\nher. We ought to gee along together very well.\"\\nTommy looked at him curiously for a minute, as though he were\\nabout to speak, then changed his mind and said nothing. Tuppence\\nand Julius! Well, why not? Had she not lamented the fact that\\nshe knew no rich men? Had she not openly avowed her intention of\\nmarrying for money if she ever had the chance? Her meeting with\\nthe young American millionaire had given her the chance--and it\\nwas unlikely she would be slow to avail herself of it. She was\\nout for money. She had always said so. Why blame her because\\nshe had been true to her creed?\\nNevertheless, Tommy did blame her. He was filled with a\\npassionate and utterly illogical resentment. It was all very\\nwell to SAY things like that--but a REAL girl would never marry\\nfor money. Tuppence was utterly cold-blooded and selfish, and he\\nwould be delighted if he never saw her again! And it was a\\nrotten world!\\nJulius\\'s voice broke in on these meditations.\\n\"Yes, we ought to get along together very well. I\\'ve heard that\\na girl always refuses you once--a sort of convention.\"\\nTommy caught his arm.\\n\"Refuses? Did you say REFUSES?\"\\n\"Sure thing. Didn\\'t I tell you that? She just rapped out a \\'no\\'\\nwithout any kind of reason to it. The eternal feminine, the Huns\\ncall it, I\\'ve heard. But she\\'ll come round right enough. Likely\\nenough, I hustled her some----\"\\nBut Tommy interrupted regardless of decorum.\\n\"What did she say in that note?\" he demanded fiercely.\\nThe obliging Julius handed it to him.\\n\"There\\'s no earthly clue in it as to where she\\'s gone,\" he\\nassured Tommy. \"But you might as well see for yourself if you\\ndon\\'t believe me.\"\\nThe note, in Tuppence\\'s well-known schoolboy writing, ran as\\nfollows:\\n\"DEAR JULIUS,\\n\"It\\'s always better to have things in black and white. I don\\'t\\nfeel I can be bothered to think of marriage until Tommy is found.\\nLet\\'s leave it till then.\\n\"Yours affectionately,\\n\"TUPPENCE.\"\\nTommy handed it back, his eyes shining. His feelings had\\nundergone a sharp reaction. He now felt that Tuppence was all\\nthat was noble and disinterested. Had she not refused Julius\\nwithout hesitation? True, the note betokened signs of weakening,\\nbut he could excuse that. It read almost like a bribe to Julius\\nto spur him on in his efforts to find Tommy, but he supposed she\\nhad not really meant it that way. Darling Tuppence, there was not\\na girl in the world to touch her! When he saw her----His thoughts\\nwere brought up with a sudden jerk.\\n\"As you say,\" he remarked, pulling himself together, \"there\\'s not\\na hint here as to what she\\'s up to. Hi--Henry!\"\\nThe small boy came obediently. Tommy produced five shillings.\\n\"One thing more. Do you remember what the young lady did with\\nthe telegram?\"\\nHenry gasped and spoke.\\n\"She crumpled it up into a ball and threw it into the grate, and\\nmade a sort of noise like \\'Whoop!\\' sir.\"\\n\"Very graphic, Henry,\" said Tommy. \"Here\\'s your five shillings.\\nCome on, Julius. We must find that telegram.\"\\nThey hurried upstairs. Tuppence had left the key in her door.\\nThe room was as she had left it. In the fireplace was a crumpled\\nball of orange and white. Tommy disentangled it and smoothed out\\nthe telegram.\\n\"Come at once, Moat House, Ebury, Yorkshire, great\\ndevelopments--TOMMY.\"\\nThey looked at each other in stupefaction. Julius spoke first:\\n\"You didn\\'t send it?\"\\n\"Of course not. What does it mean?\"\\n\"I guess it means the worst,\" said Julius quietly. \"They\\'ve got\\nher.\"\\n\"WHAT?\"\\n\"Sure thing! They signed your name, and she fell into the trap\\nlike a lamb.\"\\n\"My God! What shall we do?\"\\n\"Get busy, and go after her! Right now! There\\'s no time to\\nwaste. It\\'s almighty luck that she didn\\'t take the wire with her.\\nIf she had we\\'d probably never have traced her. But we\\'ve got to\\nhustle. Where\\'s that Bradshaw?\"\\nThe energy of Julius was infectious. Left to himself, Tommy\\nwould probably have sat down to think things out for a good\\nhalf-hour before he decided on a plan of action. But with Julius\\nHersheimmer about, hustling was inevitable.\\nAfter a few muttered imprecations he handed the Bradshaw to Tommy\\nas being more conversant with its mysteries. Tommy abandoned it\\nin favour of an A.B.C.\\n\"Here we are. Ebury, Yorks. From King\\'s Cross. Or St. Pancras.\\n(Boy must have made a mistake. It was King\\'s Cross, not CHARING\\nCross.) 12.50, that\\'s the train she went by. 2.10, that\\'s gone.\\n3.20 is the next--and a damned slow train too.\"\\n\"What about the car?\"\\nTommy shook his head.\\n\"Send it up if you like, but we\\'d better stick to the train. The\\ngreat thing is to keep calm.\"\\nJulius groaned.\\n\"That\\'s so. But it gets my goat to think of that innocent young\\ngirl in danger!\"\\nTommy nodded abstractedly. He was thinking. In a moment or two,\\nhe said:\\n\"I say, Julius, what do they want her for, anyway?\"\\n\"Eh? I don\\'t get you?\"\\n\"What I mean is that I don\\'t think it\\'s their game to do her any\\nharm,\" explained Tommy, puckering his brow with the strain of his\\nmental processes. \"She\\'s a hostage, that\\'s what she is. She\\'s in\\nno immediate danger, because if we tumble on to anything, she\\'d\\nbe damned useful to them. As long as they\\'ve got her, they\\'ve got\\nthe whip hand of us. See?\"\\n\"Sure thing,\" said Julius thoughtfully. \"That\\'s so.\"\\n\"Besides,\" added Tommy, as an afterthought, \"I\\'ve great faith in\\nTuppence.\"\\nThe journey was wearisome, with many stops, and crowded\\ncarriages. They had to change twice, once at Doncaster, once at a\\nsmall junction. Ebury was a deserted station with a solitary\\nporter, to whom Tommy addressed himself:\\n\"Can you tell me the way to the Moat House?\"\\n\"The Moat House? It\\'s a tidy step from here. The big house near\\nthe sea, you mean?\"\\nTommy assented brazenly. After listening to the porter\\'s\\nmeticulous but perplexing directions, they prepared to leave the\\nstation. It was beginning to rain, and they turned up the collars\\nof their coats as they trudged through the slush of the road.\\nSuddenly Tommy halted.\\n\"Wait a moment.\" He ran back to the station and tackled the\\nporter anew.\\n\"Look here, do you remember a young lady who arrived by an\\nearlier train, the 12.50 from London? She\\'d probably ask you the\\nway to the Moat House.\"\\nHe described Tuppence as well as he could, but the porter shook\\nhis head. Several people had arrived by the train in question.\\nHe could not call to mind one young lady in particular. But he\\nwas quite certain that no one had asked him the way to the Moat\\nHouse.\\nTommy rejoined Julius, and explained. Depression was settling on\\nhim like a leaden weight. He felt convinced that their quest was\\ngoing to be unsuccessful. The enemy had over three hours\\' start.\\nThree hours was more than enough for Mr. Brown. He would not\\nignore the possibility of the telegram having been found.\\nThe way seemed endless. Once they took the wrong turning and\\nwent nearly half a mile out of their direction. It was past seven\\no\\'clock when a small boy told them that \"t\\' Moat House\" was just\\npast the next corner.\\nA rusty iron gate swinging dismally on its hinges! An overgrown\\ndrive thick with leaves. There was something about the place\\nthat struck a chill to both their hearts. They went up the\\ndeserted drive. The leaves deadened their footsteps. The\\ndaylight was almost gone. It was like walking in a world of\\nghosts. Overhead the branches flapped and creaked with a mournful\\nnote. Occasionally a sodden leaf drifted silently down, startling\\nthem with its cold touch on their cheek.\\nA turn of the drive brought them in sight of the house. That,\\ntoo, seemed empty and deserted. The shutters were closed, the\\nsteps up to the door overgrown with moss. Was it indeed to this\\ndesolate spot that Tuppence had been decoyed? It seemed hard to\\nbelieve that a human footstep had passed this way for months.\\nJulius jerked the rusty bell handle. A jangling peal rang\\ndiscordantly, echoing through the emptiness within. No one came.\\nThey rang again and again--but there was no sign of life. Then\\nthey walked completely round the house. Everywhere silence, and\\nshuttered windows. If they could believe the evidence of their\\neyes the place was empty.\\n\"Nothing doing,\" said Julius.\\nThey retraced their steps slowly to the gate.\\n\"There must be a village handy,\" continued the young American.\\n\"We\\'d better make inquiries there. They\\'ll know something about\\nthe place, and whether there\\'s been anyone there lately.\"\\n\"Yes, that\\'s not a bad idea.\"\\nProceeding up the road, they soon came to a little hamlet. On the\\noutskirts of it, they met a workman swinging his bag of tools,\\nand Tommy stopped him with a question.\\n\"The Moat House? It\\'s empty. Been empty for years. Mrs;\\nSweeny\\'s got the key if you want to go over it--next to the post\\noffice.\"\\nTommy thanked him. They soon found the post office, which was\\nalso a sweet and general fancy shop, and knocked at the door of\\nthe cottage next to it. A clean, wholesome-looking woman opened\\nit. She readily produced the key of the Moat House.\\n\"Though I doubt if it\\'s the kind of place to suit you, sir. In a\\nterrible state of repair. Ceilings leaking and all. \\'Twould need\\na lot of money spent on it.\"\\n\"Thanks,\" said Tommy cheerily. \"I dare say it\\'ll be a washout,\\nbut houses are scarce nowadays.\"\\n\"That they are,\" declared the woman heartily. \"My daughter and\\nson-in-law have been looking for a decent cottage for I don\\'t\\nknow how long. It\\'s all the war. Upset things terribly, it has.\\nBut excuse me, sir, it\\'ll be too dark for you to see much of the\\nhouse. Hadn\\'t you better wait until to-morrow?\"\\n\"That\\'s all right. We\\'ll have a look around this evening,\\nanyway. We\\'d have been here before only we lost our way. What\\'s\\nthe best place to stay at for the night round here?\"\\nMrs. Sweeny looked doubtful.\\n\"There\\'s the Yorkshire Arms, but it\\'s not much of a place for\\ngentlemen like you.\"\\n\"Oh, it will do very well. Thanks. By the way, you\\'ve not had a\\nyoung lady here asking for this key to-day?\"\\nThe woman shook her head.\\n\"No one\\'s been over the place for a long time.\"\\n\"Thanks very much.\"\\nThey retraced their steps to the Moat House. As the front door\\nswung back on its hinges, protesting loudly, Julius struck a\\nmatch and examined the floor carefully. Then he shook his head.\\n\"I\\'d swear no one\\'s passed this way. Look at the dust. Thick.\\nNot a sign of a footmark.\"\\nThey wandered round the deserted house. Everywhere the same\\ntale. Thick layers of dust apparently undisturbed.\\n\"This gets me,\" said Julius. \"I don\\'t believe Tuppence was ever\\nin this house.\"\\n\"She must have been.\"\\nJulius shook his head without replying.\\n\"We\\'ll go over it again to-morrow,\" said Tommy. \"Perhaps we\\'ll\\nsee more in the daylight.\"\\nOn the morrow they took up the search once more, and were\\nreluctantly forced to the conclusion that the house had not been\\ninvaded for some considerable time. They might have left the\\nvillage altogether but for a fortunate discovery of Tommy\\'s. As\\nthey were retracing their steps to the gate, he gave a sudden\\ncry, and stooping, picked something up from among the leaves, and\\nheld it out to Julius. It was a small gold brooch.\\n\"That\\'s Tuppence\\'s!\"\\n\"Are you sure?\"\\n\"Absolutely. I\\'ve often seen her wear it.\"\\nJulius drew a deep breath.\\n\"I guess that settles it. She came as far as here, anyway.\\nWe\\'ll make that pub our head-quarters, and raise hell round here\\nuntil we find her. Somebody MUST have seen her.\"\\nForthwith the campaign began. Tommy and Julius worked separately\\nand together, but the result was the same. Nobody answering to\\nTuppence\\'s description had been seen in the vicinity. They were\\nbaffled--but not discouraged. Finally they altered their\\ntactics. Tuppence had certainly not remained long in the\\nneighbourhood of the Moat House. That pointed to her having been\\novercome and carried away in a car. They renewed inquiries. Had\\nanyone seen a car standing somewhere near the Moat House that\\nday? Again they met with no success.\\nJulius wired to town for his own car, and they scoured the\\nneighbourhood daily with unflagging zeal. A grey limousine on\\nwhich they had set high hopes was traced to Harrogate, and turned\\nout to be the property of a highly respectable maiden lady!\\nEach day saw them set out on a new quest. Julius was like a\\nhound on the leash. He followed up the slenderest clue. Every\\ncar that had passed through the village on the fateful day was\\ntracked down. He forced his way into country properties and\\nsubmitted the owners of the motors to a searching\\ncross-examination. His apologies were as thorough as his methods,\\nand seldom failed in disarming the indignation of his victims;\\nbut, as day succeeded day, they were no nearer to discovering\\nTuppence\\'s whereabouts. So well had the abduction been planned\\nthat the girl seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.\\nAnd another preoccupation was weighing on Tommy\\'s mind.\\n\"Do you know how long we\\'ve been here?\" he asked one morning as\\nthey sat facing each other at breakfast. \"A week! We\\'re no\\nnearer to finding Tuppence, and NEXT SUNDAY IS THE 29TH!\"\\n\"Shucks!\" said Julius thoughtfully. \"I\\'d almost forgotten about\\nthe 29th. I\\'ve been thinking of nothing but Tuppence.\"\\n\"So have I. At least, I hadn\\'t forgotten about the 29th, but it\\ndidn\\'t seem to matter a damn in comparison to finding Tuppence.\\nBut to-day\\'s the 23rd, and time\\'s getting short. If we\\'re ever\\ngoing to get hold of her at all, we must do it before the\\n29th--her life won\\'t be worth an hour\\'s purchase afterwards. The\\nhostage game will be played out by then. I\\'m beginning to feel\\nthat we\\'ve made a big mistake in the way we\\'ve set about this.\\nWe\\'ve wasted time and we\\'re no forrader.\"\\n\"I\\'m with you there. We\\'ve been a couple of mutts, who\\'ve bitten\\noff a bigger bit than they can chew. I\\'m going to quit fooling\\nright away!\"\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\"I\\'ll tell you. I\\'m going to do what we ought to have done a\\nweek ago. I\\'m going right back to London to put the case in the\\nhands of your British police. We fancied ourselves as sleuths.\\nSleuths! It was a piece of damn-fool foolishness! I\\'m through!\\nI\\'ve had enough of it. Scotland Yard for me!\"\\n\"You\\'re right,\" said Tommy slowly. \"I wish to God we\\'d gone\\nthere right away.\"\\n\"Better late than never. We\\'ve been like a couple of babes\\nplaying \\'Here we go round the Mulberry Bush.\\' Now I\\'m going\\nright along to Scotland Yard to ask them to take me by the hand\\nand show me the way I should go. I guess the professional always\\nscores over the amateur in the end. Are you coming along with\\nme?\"\\nTommy shook his head.\\n\"What\\'s the good? One of us is enough. I might as well stay\\nhere and nose round a bit longer. Something MIGHT turn up. One\\nnever knows.\"\\n\"Sure thing. Well, so long. I\\'ll be back in a couple of shakes\\nwith a few inspectors along. I shall tell them to pick out their\\nbrightest and best.\"\\nBut the course of events was not to follow the plan Julius had\\nlaid down. Later in the day Tommy received a wire:\\n\"Join me Manchester Midland Hotel. Important news--JULIUS.\"\\nAt 7:30 that night Tommy alighted from a slow cross-country\\ntrain. Julius was on the platform.\\n\"Thought you\\'d come by this train if you weren\\'t out when my wire\\narrived.\"\\nTommy grasped him by the arm.\\n\"What is it? Is Tuppence found?\"\\nJulius shook his head.\\n\"No. But I found this waiting in London. Just arrived.\"\\nHe handed the telegraph form to the other. Tommy\\'s eyes opened\\nas he read:\\n\"Jane Finn found. Come Manchester Midland Hotel\\nimmediately--PEEL EDGERTON.\"\\nJulius took the form back and folded it up.\\n\"Queer,\" he said thoughtfully. \"I thought that lawyer chap had\\nquit!\"\\nCHAPTER XIX\\nJANE FINN\\n\"MY train got in half an hour ago,\" explained Julius, as he led\\nthe way out of the station. \"I reckoned you\\'d come by this\\nbefore I left London, and wired accordingly to Sir James. He\\'s\\nbooked rooms for us, and will be round to dine at eight.\"\\n\"What made you think he\\'d ceased to take any interest in the\\ncase?\" asked Tommy curiously.\\n\"What he said,\" replied Julius dryly. \"The old bird\\'s as close\\nas an oyster! Like all the darned lot of them, he wasn\\'t going to\\ncommit himself till he was sure he could deliver the goods.\"\\n\"I wonder,\" said Tommy thoughtfully.\\nJulius turned on him.\\n\"You wonder what?\"\\n\"Whether that was his real reason.\"\\n\"Sure. You bet your life it was.\"\\nTommy shook his head unconvinced.\\nSir James arrived punctually at eight o\\'clock, and Julius\\nintroduced Tommy. Sir James shook hands with him warmly.\\n\"I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Mr. Beresford. I have\\nheard so much about you from Miss Tuppence\"--he smiled\\ninvoluntarily--\"that it really seems as though I already know you\\nquite well.\"\\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Tommy with his cheerful grin. He scanned\\nthe great lawyer eagerly. Like Tuppence, he felt the magnetism\\nof the other\\'s personality. He was reminded of Mr. Carter. The\\ntwo men, totally unlike so far as physical resemblance went,\\nproduced a similar effect. Beneath the weary manner of the one\\nand the professional reserve of the other, lay the same quality\\nof mind, keen-edged like a rapier.\\nIn the meantime he was conscious of Sir James\\'s close scrutiny.\\nWhen the lawyer dropped his eyes the young man had the feeling\\nthat the other had read him through and through like an open\\nbook. He could not but wonder what the final judgment was, but\\nthere was little chance of learning that. Sir James took in\\neverything, but gave out only what he chose. A proof of that\\noccurred almost at once.\\nImmediately the first greetings were over Julius broke out into a\\nflood of eager questions. How had Sir James managed to track the\\ngirl? Why had he not let them know that he was still working on\\nthe case? And so on.\\nSir James stroked his chin and smiled. At last he said:\\n\"Just so, just so. Well, she\\'s found. And that\\'s the great\\nthing, isn\\'t it? Eh! Come now, that\\'s the great thing?\"\\n\"Sure it is. But just how did you strike her trail? Miss\\nTuppence and I thought you\\'d quit for good and all.\"\\n\"Ah!\" The lawyer shot a lightning glance at him, then resumed\\noperations on his chin. \"You thought that, did you? Did you\\nreally? H\\'m, dear me.\"\\n\"But I guess I can take it we were wrong,\" pursued Julius.\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know that I should go so far as to say that. But\\nit\\'s certainly fortunate for all parties that we\\'ve managed to\\nfind the young lady.\"\\n\"But where is she?\" demanded Julius, his thoughts flying off on\\nanother tack. \"I thought you\\'d be sure to bring her along?\"\\n\"That would hardly be possible,\" said Sir James gravely.\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Because the young lady was knocked down in a street accident,\\nand has sustained slight injuries to the head. She was taken to\\nthe infirmary, and on recovering consciousness gave her name as\\nJane Finn. When--ah!--I heard that, I arranged for her to be\\nremoved to the house of a doctor--a friend of mine, and wired at\\nonce for you. She relapsed into unconsciousness and has not\\nspoken since.\"\\n\"She\\'s not seriously hurt?\"\\n\"Oh, a bruise and a cut or two; really, from a medical point of\\nview, absurdly slight injuries to have produced such a condition.\\nHer state is probably to be attributed to the mental shock\\nconsequent on recovering her memory.\"\\n\"It\\'s come back?\" cried Julius excitedly.\\nSir James tapped the table rather impatiently.\\n\"Undoubtedly, Mr. Hersheimmer, since she was able to give her\\nreal name. I thought you had appreciated that point.\"\\n\"And you just happened to be on the spot,\" said Tommy. \"Seems\\nquite like a fairy tale.\"\\nBut Sir James was far too wary to be drawn.\\n\"Coincidences are curious things,\" he said dryly.\\nNevertheless Tommy was now certain of what he had before only\\nsuspected. Sir James\\'s presence in Manchester was not accidental.\\nFar from abandoning the case, as Julius supposed, he had by some\\nmeans of his own successfully run the missing girl to earth. The\\nonly thing that puzzled Tommy was the reason for all this\\nsecrecy. He concluded that it was a foible of the legal mind.\\nJulius was speaking.\\n\"After dinner,\" he announced, \"I shall go right away and see\\nJane.\"\\n\"That will be impossible, I fear,\" said Sir James. \"It is very\\nunlikely they would allow her to see visitors at this time of\\nnight. I should suggest to-morrow morning about ten o\\'clock.\"\\nJulius flushed. There was something in Sir James which always\\nstirred him to antagonism. It was a conflict of two masterful\\npersonalities.\\n\"All the same, I reckon I\\'ll go round there to-night and see if I\\ncan\\'t ginger them up to break through their silly rules.\"\\n\"It will be quite useless, Mr. Hersheimmer.\"\\nThe words came out like the crack of a pistol, and Tommy looked\\nup with a start. Julius was nervous and excited. The hand with\\nwhich he raised his glass to his lips shook slightly, but his\\neyes held Sir James\\'s defiantly. For a moment the hostility\\nbetween the two seemed likely to burst into flame, but in the end\\nJulius lowered his eyes, defeated.\\n\"For the moment, I reckon you\\'re the boss.\"\\n\"Thank you,\" said the other. \"We will say ten o\\'clock then?\"\\nWith consummate ease of manner he turned to Tommy. \"I must\\nconfess, Mr. Beresford, that it was something of a surprise to me\\nto see you here this evening. The last I heard of you was that\\nyour friends were in grave anxiety on your behalf. Nothing had\\nbeen heard of you for some days, and Miss Tuppence was inclined\\nto think you had got into difficulties.\"\\n\"I had, sir!\" Tommy grinned reminiscently. \"I was never in a\\ntighter place in my life.\"\\nHelped out by questions from Sir James, he gave an abbreviated\\naccount of his adventures. The lawyer looked at him with renewed\\ninterest as he brought the tale to a close.\\n\"You got yourself out of a tight place very well,\" he said\\ngravely. \"I congratulate you. You displayed a great deal of\\ningenuity and carried your part through well.\"\\nTommy blushed, his face assuming a prawnlike hue at the praise.\\n\"I couldn\\'t have got away but for the girl, sir.\"\\n\"No.\" Sir James smiled a little. \"It was lucky for you she\\nhappened to--er--take a fancy to you.\" Tommy appeared about to\\nprotest, but Sir James went on. \"There\\'s no doubt about her being\\none of the gang, I suppose?\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid not, sir. I thought perhaps they were keeping her\\nthere by force, but the way she acted didn\\'t fit in with that.\\nYou see, she went back to them when she could have got away.\"\\nSir James nodded thoughtfully.\\n\"What did she say? Something about wanting to be taken to\\nMarguerite?\"\\n\"Yes, sir. I suppose she meant Mrs. Vandemeyer.\"\\n\"She always signed herself Rita Vandemeyer. All her friends\\nspoke of her as Rita. Still, I suppose the girl must have been\\nin the habit of calling her by her full name. And, at the moment\\nshe was crying out to her, Mrs. Vandemeyer was either dead or\\ndying! Curious! There are one or two points that strike me as\\nbeing obscure--their sudden change of attitude towards yourself,\\nfor instance. By the way, the house was raided, of course?\"\\n\"Yes, sir, but they\\'d all cleared out.\"\\n\"Naturally,\" said Sir James dryly.\\n\"And not a clue left behind.\"\\n\"I wonder----\" The lawyer tapped the table thoughtfully.\\nSomething in his voice made Tommy look up. Would this man\\'s eyes\\nhave seen something where theirs had been blind? He spoke\\nimpulsively:\\n\"I wish you\\'d been there, sir, to go over the house!\"\\n\"I wish I had,\" said Sir James quietly. He sat for a moment in\\nsilence. Then he looked up. \"And since then? What have you been\\ndoing?\"\\nFor a moment, Tommy stared at him. Then it dawned on him that of\\ncourse the lawyer did not know.\\n\"I forgot that you didn\\'t know about Tuppence,\" he said slowly.\\nThe sickening anxiety, forgotten for a while in the excitement of\\nknowing Jane Finn was found at last, swept over him again.\\nThe lawyer laid down his knife and fork sharply.\\n\"Has anything happened to Miss Tuppence?\" His voice was\\nkeen-edged.\\n\"She\\'s disappeared,\" said Julius.\\n\"When?\"\\n\"A week ago.\"\\n\"How?\"\\nSir James\\'s questions fairly shot out. Between them Tommy and\\nJulius gave the history of the last week and their futile search.\\nSir James went at once to the root of the matter.\\n\"A wire signed with your name? They knew enough of you both for\\nthat. They weren\\'t sure of how much you had learnt in that house.\\nTheir kidnapping of Miss Tuppence is the counter-move to your\\nescape. If necessary they could seal your lips with a threat of\\nwhat might happen to her.\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"That\\'s just what I thought, sir.\"\\nSir James looked at him keenly. \"You had worked that out, had\\nyou? Not bad--not at all bad. The curious thing is that they\\ncertainly did not know anything about you when they first held\\nyou prisoner. You are sure that you did not in any way disclose\\nyour identity?\"\\nTommy shook his head.\\n\"That\\'s so,\" said Julius with a nod. \"Therefore I reckon some\\none put them wise--and not earlier than Sunday afternoon.\"\\n\"Yes, but who?\"\\n\"That almighty omniscient Mr. Brown, of course!\"\\nThere was a faint note of derision in the American\\'s voice which\\nmade Sir James look up sharply.\\n\"You don\\'t believe in Mr. Brown, Mr. Hersheimmer?\"\\n\"No, sir, I do not,\" returned the young American with emphasis.\\n\"Not as such, that is to say. I reckon it out that he\\'s a\\nfigurehead--just a bogy name to frighten the children with. The\\nreal head of this business is that Russian chap Kramenin. I\\nguess he\\'s quite capable of running revolutions in three\\ncountries at once if he chose! The man Whittington is probably\\nthe head of the English branch.\"\\n\"I disagree with you,\" said Sir James shortly. \"Mr. Brown\\nexists.\" He turned to Tommy. \"Did you happen to notice where\\nthat wire was handed in?\"\\n\"No, sir, I\\'m afraid I didn\\'t.\"\\n\"H\\'m. Got it with you?\"\\n\"It\\'s upstairs, sir, in my kit.\"\\n\"I\\'d like to have a look at it sometime. No hurry. You\\'ve\\nwasted a week\"--Tommy hung his head--\"a day or so more is\\nimmaterial. We\\'ll deal with Miss Jane Finn first. Afterwards,\\nwe\\'ll set to work to rescue Miss Tuppence from bondage. I don\\'t\\nthink she\\'s in any immediate danger. That is, so long as they\\ndon\\'t know that we\\'ve got Jane Finn, and that her memory has\\nreturned. We must keep that dark at all costs. You understand?\"\\nThe other two assented, and, after making arrangements for\\nmeeting on the morrow, the great lawyer took his leave.\\nAt ten o\\'clock, the two young men were at the appointed spot. Sir\\nJames had joined them on the doorstep. He alone appeared\\nunexcited. He introduced them to the doctor.\\n\"Mr. Hersheimmer--Mr. Beresford--Dr. Roylance. How\\'s the\\npatient?\"\\n\"Going on well. Evidently no idea of the flight of time. Asked\\nthis morning how many had been saved from the Lusitania. Was it\\nin the papers yet? That, of course, was only what was to be\\nexpected. She seems to have something on her mind, though.\"\\n\"I think we can relieve her anxiety. May we go up?\"\\n\"Certainly.\"\\nTommy\\'s heart beat sensibly faster as they followed the doctor\\nupstairs. Jane Finn at last! The long-sought, the mysterious,\\nthe elusive Jane Finn! How wildly improbable success had seemed!\\nAnd here in this house, her memory almost miraculously restored,\\nlay the girl who held the future of England in her hands. A half\\ngroan broke from Tommy\\'s lips. If only Tuppence could have been\\nat his side to share in the triumphant conclusion of their joint\\nventure! Then he put the thought of Tuppence resolutely aside.\\nHis confidence in Sir James was growing. There was a man who\\nwould unerringly ferret out Tuppence\\'s whereabouts. In the\\nmeantime Jane Finn! And suddenly a dread clutched at his heart.\\nIt seemed too easy.... Suppose they should find her dead ...\\nstricken down by the hand of Mr. Brown?\\nIn another minute he was laughing at these melodramatic fancies.\\nThe doctor held open the door of a room and they passed in. On\\nthe white bed, bandages round her head, lay the girl. Somehow the\\nwhole scene seemed unreal. It was so exactly what one expected\\nthat it gave the effect of being beautifully staged.\\nThe girl looked from one to the other of them with large\\nwondering eyes. Sir James spoke first.\\n\"Miss Finn,\" he said, \"this is your cousin, Mr. Julius P.\\nHersheimmer.\"\\nA faint flush flitted over the girl\\'s face, as Julius stepped\\nforward and took her hand.\\n\"How do, Cousin Jane?\" he said lightly.\\nBut Tommy caught the tremor in his voice.\\n\"Are you really Uncle Hiram\\'s son?\" she asked wonderingly.\\nHer voice, with the slight warmth of the Western accent, had an\\nalmost thrilling quality. It seemed vaguely familiar to Tommy,\\nbut he thrust the impression aside as impossible.\\n\"Sure thing.\"\\n\"We used to read about Uncle Hiram in the papers,\" continued the\\ngirl, in her low soft tones. \"But I never thought I\\'d meet you\\none day. Mother figured it out that Uncle Hiram would never get\\nover being mad with her.\"\\n\"The old man was like that,\" admitted Julius. \"But I guess the\\nnew generation\\'s sort of different. Got no use for the family\\nfeud business. First thing I thought about, soon as the war was\\nover, was to come along and hunt you up.\"\\nA shadow passed over the girl\\'s face.\\n\"They\\'ve been telling me things--dreadful things--that my memory\\nwent, and that there are years I shall never know about--years\\nlost out of my life.\"\\n\"You didn\\'t realize that yourself?\"\\nThe girl\\'s eyes opened wide.\\n\"Why, no. It seems to me as though it were no time since we were\\nbeing hustled into those boats. I can see it all now.\" She\\nclosed her eyes with a shudder.\\nJulius looked across at Sir James, who nodded.\\n\"Don\\'t worry any. It isn\\'t worth it. Now, see here, Jane,\\nthere\\'s something we want to know about. There was a man aboard\\nthat boat with some mighty important papers on him, and the big\\nguns in this country have got a notion that he passed on the\\ngoods to you. Is that so?\"\\nThe girl hesitated, her glance shifting to the other two. Julius\\nunderstood.\\n\"Mr. Beresford is commissioned by the British Government to get\\nthose papers back. Sir James Peel Edgerton is an English Member\\nof Parliament, and might be a big gun in the Cabinet if he liked.\\nIt\\'s owing to him that we\\'ve ferreted you out at last. So you can\\ngo right ahead and tell us the whole story. Did Danvers give you\\nthe papers?\"\\n\"Yes. He said they\\'d have a better chance with me, because they\\nwould save the women and children first.\"\\n\"Just as we thought,\" said Sir James.\\n\"He said they were very important--that they might make all the\\ndifference to the Allies. But, if it\\'s all so long ago, and the\\nwar\\'s over, what does it matter now?\"\\n\"I guess history repeats itself, Jane. First there was a great\\nhue and cry over those papers, then it all died down, and now the\\nwhole caboodle\\'s started all over again--for rather different\\nreasons. Then you can hand them over to us right away?\"\\n\"But I can\\'t.\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"I haven\\'t got them.\"\\n\"You--haven\\'t--got them?\" Julius punctuated the words with\\nlittle pauses.\\n\"No--I hid them.\"\\n\"You hid them?\"\\n\"Yes. I got uneasy. People seemed to be watching me. It scared\\nme--badly.\" She put her hand to her head. \"It\\'s almost the last\\nthing I remember before waking up in the hospital....\"\\n\"Go on,\" said Sir James, in his quiet penetrating tones. \"What do\\nyou remember?\"\\nShe turned to him obediently.\\n\"It was at Holyhead. I came that way--I don\\'t remember why....\"\\n\"That doesn\\'t matter. Go on.\"\\n\"In the confusion on the quay I slipped away. Nobody saw me. I\\ntook a car. Told the man to drive me out of the town. I watched\\nwhen we got on the open road. No other car was following us. I\\nsaw a path at the side of the road. I told the man to wait.\"\\nShe paused, then went on. \"The path led to the cliff, and down\\nto the sea between big yellow gorse bushes--they were like golden\\nflames. I looked round. There wasn\\'t a soul in sight. But just\\nlevel with my head there was a hole in the rock. It was quite\\nsmall--I could only just get my hand in, but it went a long way\\nback. I took the oilskin packet from round my neck and shoved it\\nright in as far as I could. Then I tore off a bit of gorse--My!\\nbut it did prick--and plugged the hole with it so that you\\'d\\nnever guess there was a crevice of any kind there. Then I marked\\nthe place carefully in my own mind, so that I\\'d find it again.\\nThere was a queer boulder in the path just there--for all the\\nworld like a dog sitting up begging. Then I went back to the\\nroad. The car was waiting, and I drove back. I just caught the\\ntrain. I was a bit ashamed of myself for fancying things maybe,\\nbut, by and by, I saw the man opposite me wink at a woman who was\\nsitting next to me, and I felt scared again, and was glad the\\npapers were safe. I went out in the corridor to get a little air.\\nI thought I\\'d slip into another carriage. But the woman called\\nme back, said I\\'d dropped something, and when I stooped to look,\\nsomething seemed to hit me--here.\" She placed her hand to the\\nback of her head. \"I don\\'t remember anything more until I woke up\\nin the hospital.\"\\nThere was a pause.\\n\"Thank you, Miss Finn.\" It was Sir James who spoke. \"I hope we\\nhave not tired you?\"\\n\"Oh, that\\'s all right. My head aches a little, but otherwise I\\nfeel fine.\"\\nJulius stepped forward and took her hand again.\\n\"So long, Cousin Jane. I\\'m going to get busy after those papers,\\nbut I\\'ll be back in two shakes of a dog\\'s tail, and I\\'ll tote you\\nup to London and give you the time of your young life before we\\ngo back to the States! I mean it--so hurry up and get well.\"\\nCHAPTER XX\\nTOO LATE\\nIN the street they held an informal council of war. Sir James had\\ndrawn a watch from his pocket. \"The boat train to Holyhead stops\\nat Chester at 12.14. If you start at once I think you can catch\\nthe connection.\"\\nTommy looked up, puzzled.\\n\"Is there any need to hurry, sir? To-day is only the 24th.\"\\n\"I guess it\\'s always well to get up early in the morning,\" said\\nJulius, before the lawyer had time to reply. \"We\\'ll make tracks\\nfor the depot right away.\"\\nA little frown had settled on Sir James\\'s brow.\\n\"I wish I could come with you. I am due to speak at a meeting at\\ntwo o\\'clock. It is unfortunate.\"\\nThe reluctance in his tone was very evident. It was clear, on\\nthe other hand, that Julius was easily disposed to put up with\\nthe loss of the other\\'s company.\\n\"I guess there\\'s nothing complicated about this deal,\" he\\nremarked. \"Just a game of hide-and-seek, that\\'s all.\"\\n\"I hope so,\" said Sir James.\\n\"Sure thing. What else could it be?\"\\n\"You are still young, Mr. Hersheimmer. At my age you will\\nprobably have learnt one lesson. \\'Never underestimate your\\nadversary.\\' \"\\nThe gravity of his tone impressed Tommy, but had little effect\\nupon Julius.\\n\"You think Mr. Brown might come along and take a hand? If he\\ndoes, I\\'m ready for him.\" He slapped his pocket. \"I carry a gun.\\nLittle Willie here travels round with me everywhere.\" He\\nproduced a murderous-looking automatic, and tapped it\\naffectionately before returning it to its home. \"But he won\\'t be\\nneeded this trip. There\\'s nobody to put Mr. Brown wise.\"\\nThe lawyer shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"There was nobody to put Mr. Brown wise to the fact that Mrs.\\nVandemeyer meant to betray him. Nevertheless, MRS. VANDEMEYER\\nDIED WITHOUT SPEAKING.\"\\nJulius was silenced for once, and Sir James added on a lighter\\nnote:\\n\"I only want to put you on your guard. Good-bye, and good luck.\\nTake no unnecessary risks once the papers are in your hands. If\\nthere is any reason to believe that you have been shadowed,\\ndestroy them at once. Good luck to you. The game is in your\\nhands now.\" He shook hands with them both.\\nTen minutes later the two young men were seated in a first-class\\ncarriage en route for Chester.\\nFor a long time neither of them spoke. When at length Julius\\nbroke the silence, it was with a totally unexpected remark.\\n\"Say,\" he observed thoughtfully, \"did you ever make a darned fool\\nof yourself over a girl\\'s face?\"\\nTommy, after a moment\\'s astonishment, searched his mind.\\n\"Can\\'t say I have,\" he replied at last. \"Not that I can\\nrecollect, anyhow. Why?\"\\n\"Because for the last two months I\\'ve been making a sentimental\\nidiot of myself over Jane! First moment I clapped eyes on her\\nphotograph my heart did all the usual stunts you read about in\\nnovels. I guess I\\'m ashamed to admit it, but I came over here\\ndetermined to find her and fix it all up, and take her back as\\nMrs. Julius P. Hersheimmer!\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tommy, amazed.\\nJulius uncrossed his legs brusquely and continued:\\n\"Just shows what an almighty fool a man can make of himself! One\\nlook at the girl in the flesh, and I was cured!\"\\nFeeling more tongue-tied than ever, Tommy ejaculated \"Oh!\" again.\\n\"No disparagement to Jane, mind you,\" continued the other. \"She\\'s\\na real nice girl, and some fellow will fall in love with her\\nright away.\"\\n\"I thought her a very good-looking girl,\" said Tommy, finding his\\ntongue.\\n\"Sure she is. But she\\'s not like her photo one bit. At least I\\nsuppose she is in a way--must be--because I recognized her right\\noff. If I\\'d seen her in a crowd I\\'d have said \\'There\\'s a girl\\nwhose face I know\\' right away without any hesitation. But there\\nwas something about that photo\"--Julius shook his head, and\\nheaved a sigh--\"I guess romance is a mighty queer thing!\"\\n\"It must be,\" said Tommy coldly, \"if you can come over here in\\nlove with one girl, and propose to another within a fortnight.\"\\nJulius had the grace to look discomposed.\\n\"Well, you see, I\\'d got a sort of tired feeling that I\\'d never\\nfind Jane--and that it was all plumb foolishness anyway. And\\nthen--oh, well, the French, for instance, are much more sensible\\nin the way they look at things. They keep romance and marriage\\napart----\"\\nTommy flushed.\\n\"Well, I\\'m damned! If that\\'s----\"\\nJulius hastened to interrupt.\\n\"Say now, don\\'t be hasty. I don\\'t mean what you mean. I take it\\nAmericans have a higher opinion of morality than you have even.\\nWhat I meant was that the French set about marriage in a\\nbusinesslike way--find two people who are suited to one another,\\nlook after the money affairs, and see the whole thing\\npractically, and in a businesslike spirit.\"\\n\"If you ask me,\" said Tommy, \"we\\'re all too damned businesslike\\nnowadays. We\\'re always saying, \\'Will it pay?\\' The men are bad\\nenough, and the girls are worse!\"\\n\"Cool down, son. Don\\'t get so heated.\"\\n\"I feel heated,\" said Tommy.\\nJulius looked at him and judged it wise to say no more.\\nHowever, Tommy had plenty of time to cool down before they\\nreached Holyhead, and the cheerful grin had returned to his\\ncountenance as they alighted at their destination.\\nAfter consultation, and with the aid of a road map, they were\\nfairly well agreed as to direction, so were able to hire a taxi\\nwithout more ado and drive out on the road leading to Treaddur\\nBay. They instructed the man to go slowly, and watched narrowly\\nso as not to miss the path. They came to it not long after\\nleaving the town, and Tommy stopped the car promptly, asked in a\\ncasual tone whether the path led down to the sea, and hearing it\\ndid paid off the man in handsome style.\\nA moment later the taxi was slowly chugging back to Holyhead.\\nTommy and Julius watched it out of sight, and then turned to the\\nnarrow path.\\n\"It\\'s the right one, I suppose?\" asked Tommy doubtfully. \"There\\nmust be simply heaps along here.\"\\n\"Sure it is. Look at the gorse. Remember what Jane said?\"\\nTommy looked at the swelling hedges of golden blossom which\\nbordered the path on either side, and was convinced.\\nThey went down in single file, Julius leading. Twice Tommy\\nturned his head uneasily. Julius looked back.\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know. I\\'ve got the wind up somehow. Keep fancying\\nthere\\'s some one following us.\"\\n\"Can\\'t be,\" said Julius positively. \"We\\'d see him.\"\\nTommy had to admit that this was true. Nevertheless, his sense\\nof uneasiness deepened. In spite of himself he believed in the\\nomniscience of the enemy.\\n\"I rather wish that fellow would come along,\" said Julius. He\\npatted his pocket. \"Little William here is just aching for\\nexercise!\"\\n\"Do you always carry it--him--with you?\" inquired Tommy with\\nburning curiosity.\\n\"Most always. I guess you never know what might turn up.\"\\nTommy kept a respectful silence. He was impressed by little\\nWilliam. It seemed to remove the menace of Mr. Brown farther\\naway.\\nThe path was now running along the side of the cliff, parallel to\\nthe sea. Suddenly Julius came to such an abrupt halt that Tommy\\ncannoned into him.\\n\"What\\'s up?\" he inquired.\\n\"Look there. If that doesn\\'t beat the band!\"\\nTommy looked. Standing out half obstructing the path was a huge\\nboulder which certainly bore a fanciful resemblance to a\\n\"begging\" terrier.\\n\"Well,\" said Tommy, refusing to share Julius\\'s emotion, \"it\\'s\\nwhat we expected to see, isn\\'t it?\"\\nJulius looked at him sadly and shook his head.\\n\"British phlegm! Sure we expected it--but it kind of rattles me,\\nall the same, to see it sitting there just where we expected to\\nfind it!\"\\nTommy, whose calm was, perhaps, more assumed than natural, moved\\nhis feet impatiently.\\n\"Push on. What about the hole?\"\\nThey scanned the cliff-side narrowly. Tommy heard himself saying\\nidiotically:\\n\"The gorse won\\'t be there after all these years.\"\\nAnd Julius replied solemnly:\\n\"I guess you\\'re right.\"\\nTommy suddenly pointed with a shaking hand.\\n\"What about that crevice there?\"\\nJulius replied in an awestricken voice:\\n\"That\\'s it--for sure.\"\\nThey looked at each other.\\n\"When I was in France,\" said Tommy reminiscently, \"whenever my\\nbatman failed to call me, he always said that he had come over\\nqueer. I never believed it. But whether he felt it or not,\\nthere IS such a sensation. I\\'ve got it now! Badly!\"\\nHe looked at the rock with a kind of agonized passion.\\n\"Damn it!\" he cried. \"It\\'s impossible! Five years! Think of\\nit! Bird\\'s-nesting boys, picnic parties, thousands of people\\npassing! It can\\'t be there! It\\'s a hundred to one against its\\nbeing there! It\\'s against all reason!\"\\nIndeed, he felt it to be impossible--more, perhaps, because he\\ncould not believe in his own success where so many others had\\nfailed. The thing was too easy, therefore it could not be. The\\nhole would be empty.\\nJulius looked at him with a widening smile.\\n\"I guess you\\'re rattled now all right,\" he drawled with some\\nenjoyment. \"Well, here goes!\" He thrust his hand into the\\ncrevice, and made a slight grimace. \"It\\'s a tight fit. Jane\\'s\\nhand must be a few sizes smaller than mine. I don\\'t feel\\nanything--no--say, what\\'s this? Gee whiz!\" And with a flourish\\nhe waved aloft a small discoloured packet. \"It\\'s the goods all\\nright. Sewn up in oilskin. Hold it while I get my penknife.\"\\nThe unbelievable had happened. Tommy held the precious packet\\ntenderly between his hands. They had succeeded!\\n\"It\\'s queer,\" he murmured idly, \"you\\'d think the stitches would\\nhave rotted. They look just as good as new.\"\\nThey cut them carefully and ripped away the oilskin. Inside was\\na small folded sheet of paper. With trembling fingers they\\nunfolded it. The sheet was blank! They stared at each other,\\npuzzled.\\n\"A dummy?\" hazarded Julius. \"Was Danvers just a decoy?\"\\nTommy shook his head. That solution did not satisfy him.\\nSuddenly his face cleared.\\n\"I\\'ve got it! SYMPATHETIC INK!\"\\n\"You think so?\"\\n\"Worth trying anyhow. Heat usually does the trick. Get some\\nsticks. We\\'ll make a fire.\"\\nIn a few minutes the little fire of twigs and leaves was blazing\\nmerrily. Tommy held the sheet of paper near the glow. The paper\\ncurled a little with the heat. Nothing more.\\nSuddenly Julius grasped his arm, and pointed to where characters\\nwere appearing in a faint brown colour.\\n\"Gee whiz! You\\'ve got it! Say, that idea of yours was great. It\\nnever occurred to me.\"\\nTommy held the paper in position some minutes longer until he\\njudged the heat had done its work. Then he withdrew it. A moment\\nlater he uttered a cry.\\nAcross the sheet in neat brown printing ran the words: WITH THE\\nCOMPLIMENTS OF MR. BROWN.\\nCHAPTER XXI\\nTOMMY MAKES A DISCOVERY\\nFOR a moment or two they stood staring at each other stupidly,\\ndazed with the shock. Somehow, inexplicably, Mr. Brown had\\nforestalled them. Tommy accepted defeat quietly. Not so Julius.\\n\"How in tarnation did he get ahead of us? That\\'s what beats me!\"\\nhe ended up.\\nTommy shook his head, and said dully:\\n\"It accounts for the stitches being new. We might have\\nguessed....\"\\n\"Never mind the darned stitches. How did he get ahead of us? We\\nhustled all we knew. It\\'s downright impossible for anyone to get\\nhere quicker than we did. And, anyway, how did he know? Do you\\nreckon there was a dictaphone in Jane\\'s room? I guess there must\\nhave been.\"\\nBut Tommy\\'s common sense pointed out objections.\\n\"No one could have known beforehand that she was going to be in\\nthat house--much less that particular room.\"\\n\"That\\'s so,\" admitted Julius. \"Then one of the nurses was a\\ncrook and listened at the door. How\\'s that?\"\\n\"I don\\'t see that it matters anyway,\" said Tommy wearily. \"He may\\nhave found out some months ago, and removed the papers,\\nthen----No, by Jove, that won\\'t wash! They\\'d have been published\\nat once.\"\\n\"Sure thing they would! No, some one\\'s got ahead of us to-day by\\nan hour or so. But how they did it gets my goat.\"\\n\"I wish that chap Peel Edgerton had been with us,\" said Tommy\\nthoughtfully.\\n\"Why?\" Julius stared. \"The mischief was done when we came.\"\\n\"Yes----\" Tommy hesitated. He could not explain his own\\nfeeling--the illogical idea that the K.C.\\'s presence would\\nsomehow have averted the catastrophe. He reverted to his former\\npoint of view. \"It\\'s no good arguing about how it was done. The\\ngame\\'s up. We\\'ve failed. There\\'s only one thing for me to do.\"\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\n\"Get back to London as soon as possible. Mr. Carter must be\\nwarned. It\\'s only a matter of hours now before the blow falls.\\nBut, at any rate, he ought to know the worst.\"\\nThe duty was an unpleasant one, but Tommy had no intention of\\nshirking it. He must report his failure to Mr. Carter. After\\nthat his work was done. He took the midnight mail to London.\\nJulius elected to stay the night at Holyhead.\\nHalf an hour after arrival, haggard and pale, Tommy stood before\\nhis chief.\\n\"I\\'ve come to report, sir. I\\'ve failed--failed badly.\"\\nMr. Carter eyed him sharply.\\n\"You mean that the treaty----\"\\n\"Is in the hands of Mr. Brown, sir.\"\\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Carter quietly. The expression on his face did\\nnot change, but Tommy caught the flicker of despair in his eyes.\\nIt convinced him as nothing else had done that the outlook was\\nhopeless.\\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Carter after a minute or two, \"we mustn\\'t sag at\\nthe knees, I suppose. I\\'m glad to know definitely. We must do\\nwhat we can.\"\\nThrough Tommy\\'s mind flashed the assurance: \"It\\'s hopeless, and\\nhe knows it\\'s hopeless!\"\\nThe other looked up at him.\\n\"Don\\'t take it to heart, lad,\" he said kindly. \"You did your\\nbest. You were up against one of the biggest brains of the\\ncentury. And you came very near success. Remember that.\"\\n\"Thank you, sir. It\\'s awfully decent of you.\"\\n\"I blame myself. I have been blaming myself ever since I heard\\nthis other news.\"\\nSomething in his tone attracted Tommy\\'s attention. A new fear\\ngripped at his heart.\\n\"Is there--something more, sir?\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid so,\" said Mr. Carter gravely. He stretched out his\\nhand to a sheet on the table.\\n\"Tuppence----?\" faltered Tommy.\\n\"Read for yourself.\"\\nThe typewritten words danced before his eyes. The description of\\na green toque, a coat with a handkerchief in the pocket marked\\nP.L.C. He looked an agonized question at Mr. Carter. The latter\\nreplied to it:\\n\"Washed up on the Yorkshire coast--near Ebury. I\\'m afraid--it\\nlooks very much like foul play.\"\\n\"My God!\" gasped Tommy. \"TUPPENCE! Those devils--I\\'ll never\\nrest till I\\'ve got even with them! I\\'ll hunt them down!\\nI\\'ll----\"\\nThe pity on Mr. Carter\\'s face stopped him.\\n\"I know what you feel like, my poor boy. But it\\'s no good.\\nYou\\'ll waste your strength uselessly. It may sound harsh, but my\\nadvice to you is: Cut your losses. Time\\'s merciful. You\\'ll\\nforget.\"\\n\"Forget Tuppence? Never!\"\\nMr. Carter shook his head.\\n\"So you think now. Well, it won\\'t bear thinking of--that brave\\nlittle girl! I\\'m sorry about the whole business--confoundedly\\nsorry.\"\\nTommy came to himself with a start.\\n\"I\\'m taking up your time, sir,\" he said with an effort. \"There\\'s\\nno need for you to blame yourself. I dare say we were a couple\\nof young fools to take on such a job. You warned us all right.\\nBut I wish to God I\\'d been the one to get it in the neck.\\nGood-bye, sir.\"\\nBack at the Ritz, Tommy packed up his few belongings\\nmechanically, his thoughts far away. He was still bewildered by\\nthe introduction of tragedy into his cheerful commonplace\\nexistence. What fun they had had together, he and Tuppence! And\\nnow--oh, he couldn\\'t believe it--it couldn\\'t be true!\\nTUPPENCE--DEAD! Little Tuppence, brimming over with life! It was\\na dream, a horrible dream. Nothing more.\\nThey brought him a note, a few kind words of sympathy from Peel\\nEdgerton, who had read the news in the paper. (There had been a\\nlarge headline: EX-V.A.D. FEARED DROWNED.) The letter ended with\\nthe offer of a post on a ranch in the Argentine, where Sir James\\nhad considerable interests.\\n\"Kind old beggar,\" muttered Tommy, as he flung it aside.\\nThe door opened, and Julius burst in with his usual violence. He\\nheld an open newspaper in his hand.\\n\"Say, what\\'s all this? They seem to have got some fool idea\\nabout Tuppence.\"\\n\"It\\'s true,\" said Tommy quietly.\\n\"You mean they\\'ve done her in?\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"I suppose when they got the treaty she--wasn\\'t any good to them\\nany longer, and they were afraid to let her go.\"\\n\"Well, I\\'m darned!\" said Julius. \"Little Tuppence. She sure was\\nthe pluckiest little girl----\"\\nBut suddenly something seemed to crack in Tommy\\'s brain. He rose\\nto his feet.\\n\"Oh, get out! You don\\'t really care, damn you! You asked her to\\nmarry you in your rotten cold-blooded way, but I LOVED her. I\\'d\\nhave given the soul out of my body to save her from harm. I\\'d\\nhave stood by without a word and let her marry you, because you\\ncould have given her the sort of time she ought to have had, and\\nI was only a poor devil without a penny to bless himself with.\\nBut it wouldn\\'t have been because I didn\\'t care!\"\\n\"See here,\" began Julius temperately.\\n\"Oh, go to the devil! I can\\'t stand your coming here and talking\\nabout \\'little Tuppence.\\' Go and look after your cousin.\\nTuppence is my girl! I\\'ve always loved her, from the time we\\nplayed together as kids. We grew up and it was just the same. I\\nshall never forget when I was in hospital, and she came in in\\nthat ridiculous cap and apron! It was like a miracle to see the\\ngirl I loved turn up in a nurse\\'s kit----\"\\nBut Julius interrupted him.\\n\"A nurse\\'s kit! Gee whiz! I must be going to Colney Hatch! I\\ncould swear I\\'ve seen Jane in a nurse\\'s cap too. And that\\'s\\nplumb impossible! No, by gum, I\\'ve got it! It was her I saw\\ntalking to Whittington at that nursing home in Bournemouth. She\\nwasn\\'t a patient there! She was a nurse!\"\\n\"I dare say,\" said Tommy angrily, \"she\\'s probably been in with\\nthem from the start. I shouldn\\'t wonder if she stole those\\npapers from Danvers to begin with.\"\\n\"I\\'m darned if she did!\" shouted Julius. \"She\\'s my cousin, and\\nas patriotic a girl as ever stepped.\"\\n\"I don\\'t care a damn what she is, but get out of here!\" retorted\\nTommy also at the top of his voice.\\nThe young men were on the point of coming to blows. But\\nsuddenly, with an almost magical abruptness, Julius\\'s anger\\nabated.\\n\"All right, son,\" he said quietly, \"I\\'m going. I don\\'t blame you\\nany for what you\\'ve been saying. It\\'s mighty lucky you did say\\nit. I\\'ve been the most almighty blithering darned idiot that\\nit\\'s possible to imagine. Calm down\"--Tommy had made an impatient\\ngesture--\"I\\'m going right away now--going to the London and North\\nWestern Railway depot, if you want to know.\"\\n\"I don\\'t care a damn where you\\'re going,\" growled Tommy.\\nAs the door closed behind Julius, he returned to his suit-case.\\n\"That\\'s the lot,\" he murmured, and rang the bell.\\n\"Take my luggage down.\"\\n\"Yes, sir. Going away, sir?\"\\n\"I\\'m going to the devil,\" said Tommy, regardless of the menial\\'s\\nfeelings.\\nThat functionary, however, merely replied respectfully:\\n\"Yes, sir. Shall I call a taxi?\"\\nTommy nodded.\\nWhere was he going? He hadn\\'t the faintest idea. Beyond a fixed\\ndetermination to get even with Mr. Brown he had no plans. He\\nre-read Sir James\\'s letter, and shook his head. Tuppence must be\\navenged. Still, it was kind of the old fellow.\\n\"Better answer it, I suppose.\" He went across to the\\nwriting-table. With the usual perversity of bedroom stationery,\\nthere were innumerable envelopes and no paper. He rang. No one\\ncame. Tommy fumed at the delay. Then he remembered that there\\nwas a good supply in Julius\\'s sitting-room. The American had\\nannounced his immediate departure, there would be no fear of\\nrunning up against him. Besides, he wouldn\\'t mind if he did. He\\nwas beginning to be rather ashamed of the things he had said. Old\\nJulius had taken them jolly well. He\\'d apologize if he found him\\nthere.\\nBut the room was deserted. Tommy walked across to the\\nwriting-table, and opened the middle drawer. A photograph,\\ncarelessly thrust in face upwards, caught his eye. For a moment\\nhe stood rooted to the ground. Then he took it out, shut the\\ndrawer, walked slowly over to an arm-chair, and sat down still\\nstaring at the photograph in his hand.\\nWhat on earth was a photograph of the French girl Annette doing\\nin Julius Hersheimmer\\'s writing-table?\\nCHAPTER XXII\\nIN DOWNING STREET\\nTHE Prime Minister tapped the desk in front of him with nervous\\nfingers. His face was worn and harassed. He took up his\\nconversation with Mr. Carter at the point it had broken off. \"I\\ndon\\'t understand,\" he said. \"Do you really mean that things are\\nnot so desperate after all?\"\\n\"So this lad seems to think.\"\\n\"Let\\'s have a look at his letter again.\"\\nMr. Carter handed it over. It was written in a sprawling boyish\\nhand.\\n\"DEAR MR. CARTER,\\n\"Something\\'s turned up that has given me a jar. Of course I may\\nbe simply making an awful ass of myself, but I don\\'t think so. If\\nmy conclusions are right, that girl at Manchester was just a\\nplant. The whole thing was prearranged, sham packet and all, with\\nthe object of making us think the game was up--therefore I fancy\\nthat we must have been pretty hot on the scent.\\n\"I think I know who the real Jane Finn is, and I\\'ve even got an\\nidea where the papers are. That last\\'s only a guess, of course,\\nbut I\\'ve a sort of feeling it\\'ll turn out right. Anyhow, I\\nenclose it in a sealed envelope for what it\\'s worth. I\\'m going to\\nask you not to open it until the very last moment, midnight on\\nthe 28th, in fact. You\\'ll understand why in a minute. You see,\\nI\\'ve figured it out that those things of Tuppence\\'s are a plant\\ntoo, and she\\'s no more drowned than I am. The way I reason is\\nthis: as a last chance they\\'ll let Jane Finn escape in the hope\\nthat she\\'s been shamming this memory stunt, and that once she\\nthinks she\\'s free she\\'ll go right away to the cache. Of course\\nit\\'s an awful risk for them to take, because she knows all about\\nthem--but they\\'re pretty desperate to get hold of that treaty.\\nBUT IF THEY KNOW THAT THE PAPERS HAVE BEEN RECOVERED BY US,\\nneither of those two girls\\' lives will be worth an hour\\'s\\npurchase. I must try and get hold of Tuppence before Jane\\nescapes.\\n\"I want a repeat of that telegram that was sent to Tuppence at\\nthe Ritz. Sir James Peel Edgerton said you would be able to\\nmanage that for me. He\\'s frightfully clever.\\n\"One last thing--please have that house in Soho watched day and\\nnight.\\n\"Yours, etc.,\\n\"THOMAS BERESFORD.\"\\nThe Prime Minister looked up.\\n\"The enclosure?\"\\nMr. Carter smiled dryly.\\n\"In the vaults of the Bank. I am taking no chances.\"\\n\"You don\\'t think\"--the Prime Minister hesitated a minute--\"that\\nit would be better to open it now? Surely we ought to secure the\\ndocument, that is, provided the young man\\'s guess turns out to be\\ncorrect, at once. We can keep the fact of having done so quite\\nsecret.\"\\n\"Can we? I\\'m not so sure. There are spies all round us. Once\\nit\\'s known I wouldn\\'t give that\"--he snapped his fingers--\"for\\nthe life of those two girls. No, the boy trusted me, and I\\nshan\\'t let him down.\"\\n\"Well, well, we must leave it at that, then. What\\'s he like,\\nthis lad?\"\\n\"Outwardly, he\\'s an ordinary clean-limbed, rather block-headed\\nyoung Englishman. Slow in his mental processes. On the other\\nhand, it\\'s quite impossible to lead him astray through his\\nimagination. He hasn\\'t got any--so he\\'s difficult to deceive. He\\nworries things out slowly, and once he\\'s got hold of anything he\\ndoesn\\'t let go. The little lady\\'s quite different. More\\nintuition and less common sense. They make a pretty pair working\\ntogether. Pace and stamina.\"\\n\"He seems confident,\" mused the Prime Minister.\\n\"Yes, and that\\'s what gives me hope. He\\'s the kind of diffident\\nyouth who would have to be VERY sure before he ventured an\\nopinion at all.\"\\nA half smile came to the other\\'s lips.\\n\"And it is this--boy who will defeat the master criminal of our\\ntime?\"\\n\"This--boy, as you say! But I sometimes fancy I see a shadow\\nbehind.\"\\n\"You mean?\"\\n\"Peel Edgerton.\"\\n\"Peel Edgerton?\" said the Prime Minister in astonishment.\\n\"Yes. I see his hand in THIS.\" He struck the open letter. \"He\\'s\\nthere--working in the dark, silently, unobtrusively. I\\'ve always\\nfelt that if anyone was to run Mr. Brown to earth, Peel Edgerton\\nwould be the man. I tell you he\\'s on the case now, but doesn\\'t\\nwant it known. By the way, I got rather an odd request from him\\nthe other day.\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"He sent me a cutting from some American paper. It referred to a\\nman\\'s body found near the docks in New York about three weeks\\nago. He asked me to collect any information on the subject I\\ncould.\"\\n\"Well?\"\\nCarter shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"I couldn\\'t get much. Young fellow about thirty-five--poorly\\ndressed--face very badly disfigured. He was never identified.\"\\n\"And you fancy that the two matters are connected in some way?\"\\n\"Somehow I do. I may be wrong, of course.\"\\nThere was a pause, then Mr. Carter continued:\\n\"I asked him to come round here. Not that we\\'ll get anything out\\nof him he doesn\\'t want to tell. His legal instincts are too\\nstrong. But there\\'s no doubt he can throw light on one or two\\nobscure points in young Beresford\\'s letter. Ah, here he is!\"\\nThe two men rose to greet the new-comer. A half whimsical thought\\nflashed across the Premier\\'s mind. \"My successor, perhaps!\"\\n\"We\\'ve had a letter from young Beresford,\" said Mr. Carter,\\ncoming to the point at once. \"You\\'ve seen him, I suppose?\"\\n\"You suppose wrong,\" said the lawyer.\\n\"Oh!\" Mr. Carter was a little nonplussed.\\nSir James smiled, and stroked his chin.\\n\"He rang me up,\" he volunteered.\\n\"Would you have any objection to telling us exactly what passed\\nbetween you?\"\\n\"Not at all. He thanked me for a certain letter which I had\\nwritten to him--as a matter of fact, I had offered him a job.\\nThen he reminded me of something I had said to him at Manchester\\nrespecting that bogus telegram which lured Miss Cowley away. I\\nasked him if anything untoward had occurred. He said it\\nhad--that in a drawer in Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s room he had discovered\\na photograph.\" The laywer{sic} paused, then continued: \"I asked\\nhim if the photograph bore the name and address of a Californian\\nphotographer. He replied: \\'You\\'re on to it, sir. It had.\\' Then\\nhe went on to tell me something I DIDN\\'T know. The original of\\nthat photograph was the French girl, Annette, who saved his\\nlife.\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"Exactly. I asked the young man with some curiosity what he had\\ndone with the photograph. He replied that he had put it back\\nwhere he found it.\" The lawyer paused again. \"That was good, you\\nknow--distinctly good. He can use his brains, that young fellow.\\nI congratulated him. The discovery was a providential one. Of\\ncourse, from the moment that the girl in Manchester was proved to\\nbe a plant everything was altered. Young Beresford saw that for\\nhimself without my having to tell it him. But he felt he couldn\\'t\\ntrust his judgment on the subject of Miss Cowley. Did I think\\nshe was alive? I told him, duly weighing the evidence, that\\nthere was a very decided chance in favour of it. That brought us\\nback to the telegram.\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"I advised him to apply to you for a copy of the original wire.\\nIt had occurred to me as probable that, after Miss Cowley flung\\nit on the floor, certain words might have been erased and altered\\nwith the express intention of setting searchers on a false\\ntrail.\"\\nCarter nodded. He took a sheet from his pocket, and read aloud:\\n\"Come at once, Astley Priors, Gatehouse, Kent. Great\\ndevelopments--TOMMY.\\n\"Very simple,\" said Sir James, \"and very ingenious. Just a few\\nwords to alter, and the thing was done. And the one important\\nclue they overlooked.\"\\n\"What was that?\"\\n\"The page-boy\\'s statement that Miss Cowley drove to Charing\\nCross. They were so sure of themselves that they took it for\\ngranted he had made a mistake.\"\\n\"Then young Beresford is now?\"\\n\"At Gatehouse, Kent, unless I am much mistaken.\"\\nMr. Carter looked at him curiously.\\n\"I rather wonder you\\'re not there too, Peel Edgerton?\"\\n\"Ah, I\\'m busy on a case.\"\\n\"I thought you were on your holiday?\"\\n\"Oh, I\\'ve not been briefed. Perhaps it would be more correct to\\nsay I\\'m preparing a case. Any more facts about that American\\nchap for me?\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid not. Is it important to find out who he was?\"\\n\"Oh, I know who he was,\" said Sir James easily. \"I can\\'t prove\\nit yet--but I know.\"\\nThe other two asked no questions. They had an instinct that it\\nwould be mere waste of breath.\\n\"But what I don\\'t understand,\" said the Prime-Minister suddenly,\\n\"is how that photograph came to be in Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s drawer?\"\\n\"Perhaps it never left it,\" suggested the lawyer gently.\\n\"But the bogus inspector? Inspector Brown?\"\\n\"Ah!\" said Sir James thoughtfully. He rose to his feet. \"I\\nmustn\\'t keep you. Go on with the affairs of the nation. I must\\nget back to--my case.\"\\nTwo days later Julius Hersheimmer returned from Manchester. A\\nnote from Tommy lay on his table:\\n\"DEAR HERSHEIMMER,\\n\"Sorry I lost my temper. In case I don\\'t see you again,\\ngood-bye. I\\'ve been offered a job in the Argentine, and might as\\nwell take it. \"Yours,\\n\"TOMMY BERESFORD.\"\\nA peculiar smile lingered for a moment on Julius\\'s face. He threw\\nthe letter into the waste-paper basket.\\n\"The darned fool!\" he murmured.\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\nA RACE AGAINST TIME\\nAFTER ringing up Sir James, Tommy\\'s next procedure was to make a\\ncall at South Audley Mansions. He found Albert discharging his\\nprofessional duties, and introduced himself without more ado as a\\nfriend of Tuppence\\'s. Albert unbent immediately.\\n\"Things has been very quiet here lately,\" he said wistfully.\\n\"Hope the young lady\\'s keeping well, sir?\"\\n\"That\\'s just the point, Albert. She\\'s disappeared.\" You don\\'t\\nmean as the crooks have got her?\"\\n\"In the Underworld?\"\\n\"No, dash it all, in this world!\"\\n\"It\\'s a h\\'expression, sir,\" explained Albert. \"At the pictures\\nthe crooks always have a restoorant in the Underworld. But do\\nyou think as they\\'ve done her in, sir?\"\\n\"I hope not. By the way, have you by any chance an aunt, a\\ncousin, a grandmother, or any other suitable female relation who\\nmight be represented as being likely to kick the bucket?\"\\nA delighted grin spread slowly over Albert\\'s countenance.\\n\"I\\'m on, sir. My poor aunt what lives in the country has been\\nmortal bad for a long time, and she\\'s asking for me with her\\ndying breath.\"\\nTommy nodded approval.\\n\"Can you report this in the proper quarter and meet me at Charing\\nCross in an hour\\'s time?\"\\n\"I\\'ll be there, sir. You can count on me.\"\\nAs Tommy had judged, the faithful Albert proved an invaluable\\nally. The two took up their quarters at the inn in Gatehouse. To\\nAlbert fell the task of collecting information There was no\\ndifficulty about it.\\nAstley Priors was the property of a Dr. Adams. The doctor no\\nlonger practiced, had retired, the landlord believed, but he took\\na few private patients--here the good fellow tapped his forehead\\nknowingly--\"balmy ones! You understand!\" The doctor was a\\npopular figure in the village, subscribed freely to all the local\\nsports--\"a very pleasant, affable gentleman.\" Been there long?\\nOh, a matter of ten years or so--might be longer. Scientific\\ngentleman, he was. Professors and people often came down from\\ntown to see him. Anyway, it was a gay house, always visitors.\\nIn the face of all this volubility, Tommy felt doubts. Was it\\npossible that this genial, well-known figure could be in reality\\na dangerous criminal? His life seemed so open and aboveboard. No\\nhint of sinister doings. Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake?\\nTommy felt a cold chill at the thought.\\nThen he remembered the private patients--\"balmy ones.\" He\\ninquired carefully if there was a young lady amongst them,\\ndescribing Tuppence. But nothing much seemed to be known about\\nthe patients--they were seldom seen outside the grounds. A\\nguarded description of Annette also failed to provoke\\nrecognition.\\nAstley Priors was a pleasant red-brick edifice, surrounded by\\nwell-wooded grounds which effectually shielded the house from\\nobservation from the road.\\nOn the first evening Tommy, accompanied by Albert, explored the\\ngrounds. Owing to Albert\\'s insistence they dragged themselves\\nalong painfully on their stomachs, thereby producing a great deal\\nmore noise than if they had stood upright. In any case, these\\nprecautions were totally unnecessary. The grounds, like those of\\nany other private house after nightfall, seemed untenanted.\\nTommy had imagined a possible fierce watchdog. Albert\\'s fancy ran\\nto a puma, or a tame cobra. But they reached a shrubbery near\\nthe house quite unmolested.\\nThe blinds of the dining-room window were up. There was a large\\ncompany assembled round the table. The port was passing from\\nhand to hand. It seemed a normal, pleasant company. Through the\\nopen window scraps of conversation floated out disjointedly on\\nthe night air. It was a heated discussion on county cricket!\\nAgain Tommy felt that cold chill of uncertainty. It seemed\\nimpossible to believe that these people were other than they\\nseemed. Had he been fooled once more? The fair-bearded,\\nspectacled gentleman who sat at the head of the table looked\\nsingularly honest and normal.\\nTommy slept badly that night. The following morning the\\nindefatigable Albert, having cemented an alliance with the\\ngreengrocer\\'s boy, took the latter\\'s place and ingratiated\\nhimself with the cook at Malthouse. He returned with the\\ninformation that she was undoubtedly \"one of the crooks,\" but\\nTommy mistrusted the vividness of his imagination. Questioned,\\nhe could adduce nothing in support of his statement except his\\nown opinion that she wasn\\'t the usual kind. You could see that\\nat a glance.\\nThe substitution being repeated (much to the pecuniary advantage\\nof the real greengrocer\\'s boy) on the following day, Albert\\nbrought back the first piece of hopeful news. There WAS a French\\nyoung lady staying in the house. Tommy put his doubts aside.\\nHere was confirmation of his theory. But time pressed. To-day\\nwas the 27th. The 29th was the much-talked-of \"Labour Day,\"\\nabout which all sorts of rumours were running riot. Newspapers\\nwere getting agitated. Sensational hints of a Labour coup d\\'etat\\nwere freely reported. The Government said nothing. It knew and\\nwas prepared. There were rumours of dissension among the Labour\\nleaders. They were not of one mind. The more far-seeing among\\nthem realized that what they proposed might well be a death-blow\\nto the England that at heart they loved. They shrank from the\\nstarvation and misery a general strike would entail, and were\\nwilling to meet the Government half-way. But behind them were\\nsubtle, insistent forces at work, urging the memories of old\\nwrongs, deprecating the weakness of half-and-half measures,\\nfomenting misunderstandings.\\nTommy felt that, thanks to Mr. Carter, he understood the position\\nfairly accurately. With the fatal document in the hands of Mr.\\nBrown, public opinion would swing to the side of the Labour\\nextremists and revolutionists. Failing that, the battle was an\\neven chance. The Government with a loyal army and police force\\nbehind them might win--but at a cost of great suffering. But\\nTommy nourished another and a preposterous dream. With Mr. Brown\\nunmasked and captured he believed, rightly or wrongly, that the\\nwhole organization would crumble ignominiously and\\ninstantaneously. The strange permeating influence of the unseen\\nchief held it together. Without him, Tommy believed an instant\\npanic would set in; and, the honest men left to themselves, an\\neleventh-hour reconciliation would be possible.\\n\"This is a one-man show,\" said Tommy to himself. \"The thing to do\\nis to get hold of the man.\"\\nIt was partly in furtherance of this ambitious design that he had\\nrequested Mr. Carter not to open the sealed envelope. The draft\\ntreaty was Tommy\\'s bait. Every now and then he was aghast at his\\nown presumption. How dared he think that he had discovered what\\nso many wiser and clever men had overlooked? Nevertheless, he\\nstuck tenaciously to his idea.\\nThat evening he and Albert once more penetrated the grounds of\\nAstley Priors. Tommy\\'s ambition was somehow or other to gain\\nadmission to the house itself. As they approached cautiously,\\nTommy gave a sudden gasp.\\nOn the second floor window some one standing between the window\\nand the light in the room threw a silhouette on the blind. It was\\none Tommy would have recognized anywhere! Tuppence was in that\\nhouse!\\nHe clutched Albert by the shoulder.\\n\"Stay here! When I begin to sing, watch that window.\"\\nHe retreated hastily to a position on the main drive, and began\\nin a deep roar, coupled with an unsteady gait, the following\\nditty:\\nI am a Soldier A jolly British Soldier;\\nYou can see that I\\'m a Soldier by my feet . . .\\nIt had been a favourite on the gramophone in Tuppence\\'s hospital\\ndays. He did not doubt but that she would recognize it and draw\\nher own conclusions. Tommy had not a note of music in his voice,\\nbut his lungs were excellent. The noise he produced was terrific.\\nPresently an unimpeachable butler, accompanied by an equally\\nunimpeachable footman, issued from the front door. The butler\\nremonstrated with him. Tommy continued to sing, addressing the\\nbutler affectionately as \"dear old whiskers.\" The footman took\\nhim by one arm, the butler by the other. They ran him down the\\ndrive, and neatly out of the gate. The butler threatened him with\\nthe police if he intruded again. It was beautifully done--soberly\\nand with perfect decorum. Anyone would have sworn that the butler\\nwas a real butler, the footman a real footman--only, as it\\nhappened, the butler was Whittington!\\nTommy retired to the inn and waited for Albert\\'s return. At last\\nthat worthy made his appearance.\\n\"Well?\" cried Tommy eagerly.\\n\"It\\'s all right. While they was a-running of you out the window\\nopened, and something was chucked out.\" He handed a scrap of\\npaper to Tommy. \"It was wrapped round a letterweight.\"\\nOn the paper were scrawled three words: \"To-morrow--same time.\"\\n\"Good egg!\" cried Tommy. \"We\\'re getting going.\"\\n\"I wrote a message on a piece of paper, wrapped it round a stone,\\nand chucked it through the window,\" continued Albert\\nbreathlessly.\\nTommy groaned.\\n\"Your zeal will be the undoing of us, Albert. What did you say?\"\\n\"Said we was a-staying at the inn. If she could get away, to\\ncome there and croak like a frog.\"\\n\"She\\'ll know that\\'s you,\" said Tommy with a sigh of relief. \"Your\\nimagination runs away with you, you know, Albert. Why, you\\nwouldn\\'t recognize a frog croaking if you heard it.\"\\nAlbert looked rather crest-fallen.\\n\"Cheer up,\" said Tommy. \"No harm done. That butler\\'s an old\\nfriend of mine--I bet he knew who I was, though he didn\\'t let on.\\nIt\\'s not their game to show suspicion. That\\'s why we\\'ve found it\\nfairly plain sailing. They don\\'t want to discourage me\\naltogether. On the other hand, they don\\'t want to make it too\\neasy. I\\'m a pawn in their game, Albert, that\\'s what I am. You\\nsee, if the spider lets the fly walk out too easily, the fly\\nmight suspect it was a put-up job. Hence the usefulness of that\\npromising youth, Mr. T. Beresford, who\\'s blundered in just at the\\nright moment for them. But later, Mr. T. Beresford had better\\nlook out!\"\\nTommy retired for the night in a state of some elation. He had\\nelaborated a careful plan for the following evening. He felt sure\\nthat the inhabitants of Astley Priors would not interfere with\\nhim up to a certain point. It was after that that Tommy proposed\\nto give them a surprise.\\nAbout twelve o\\'clock, however, his calm was rudely shaken. He was\\ntold that some one was demanding him in the bar. The applicant\\nproved to be a rude-looking carter well coated with mud.\\n\"Well, my good fellow, what is it?\" asked Tommy.\\n\"Might this be for you, sir?\" The carter held out a very dirty\\nfolded note, on the outside of which was written: \"Take this to\\nthe gentleman at the inn near Astley Priors. He will give you\\nten shillings.\"\\nThe handwriting was Tuppence\\'s. Tommy appreciated her\\nquick-wittedness in realizing that he might be staying at the inn\\nunder an assumed name. He snatched at it.\\n\"That\\'s all right.\"\\nThe man withheld it.\\n\"What about my ten shillings?\"\\nTommy hastily produced a ten-shilling note, and the man\\nrelinquished his find. Tommy unfastened it.\\n\"DEAR TOMMY,\\n\"I knew it was you last night. Don\\'t go this evening. They\\'ll be\\nlying in wait for you. They\\'re taking us away this morning. I\\nheard something about Wales--Holyhead, I think. I\\'ll drop this on\\nthe road if I get a chance. Annette told me how you\\'d escaped.\\nBuck up.\\n\"Yours,\\n\"TWOPENCE.\"\\nTommy raised a shout for Albert before he had even finished\\nperusing this characteristic epistle.\\n\"Pack my bag! We\\'re off!\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\" The boots of Albert could be heard racing upstairs.\\nHolyhead? Did that mean that, after all----Tommy was puzzled. He\\nread on slowly.\\nThe boots of Albert continued to be active on the floor above.\\nSuddenly a second shout came from below.\\n\"Albert! I\\'m a damned fool! Unpack that bag!\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\nTommy smoothed out the note thoughtfully.\\n\"Yes, a damned fool,\" he said softly. \"But so\\'s some one else!\\nAnd at last I know who it is!\"\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\nJULIUS TAKES A HAND\\nIN his suite at Claridge\\'s, Kramenin reclined on a couch and\\ndictated to his secretary in sibilant Russian.\\nPresently the telephone at the secretary\\'s elbow purred, and he\\ntook up the receiver, spoke for a minute or two, then turned to\\nhis employer.\\n\"Some one below is asking for you.\"\\n\"Who is it?\"\\n\"He gives the name of Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer.\"\\n\"Hersheimmer,\" repeated Kramenin thoughtfully. \"I have heard\\nthat name before.\"\\n\"His father was one of the steel kings of America,\" explained the\\nsecretary, whose business it was to know everything. \"This young\\nman must be a millionaire several times over.\"\\nThe other\\'s eyes narrowed appreciatively.\\n\"You had better go down and see him, Ivan. Find out what he\\nwants.\"\\nThe secretary obeyed, closing the door noiselessly behind him. In\\na few minutes he returned.\\n\"He declines to state his business--says it is entirely private\\nand personal, and that he must see you.\"\\n\"A millionaire several times over,\" murmured Kramenin. \"Bring\\nhim up, my dear Ivan.\"\\nThe secretary left the room once more, and returned escorting\\nJulius.\\n\"Monsieur Kramenin?\" said the latter abruptly.\\nThe Russian, studying him attentively with his pale venomous\\neyes, bowed.\\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" said the American. \"I\\'ve got some very\\nimportant business I\\'d like to talk over with you, if I can see\\nyou alone.\" He looked pointedly at the other.\\n\"My secretary, Monsieur Grieber, from whom I have no secrets.\"\\n\"That may be so--but I have,\" said Julius dryly. \"So I\\'d be\\nobliged if you\\'d tell him to scoot.\"\\n\"Ivan,\" said the Russian softly, \"perhaps you would not mind\\nretiring into the next room----\"\\n\"The next room won\\'t do,\" interrupted Julius. \"I know these\\nducal suites--and I want this one plumb empty except for you and\\nme. Send him round to a store to buy a penn\\'orth of peanuts.\"\\nThough not particularly enjoying the American\\'s free and easy\\nmanner of speech, Kramenin was devoured by curiosity. \"Will your\\nbusiness take long to state?\"\\n\"Might be an all night job if you caught on.\"\\n\"Very good, Ivan. I shall not require you again this evening. Go\\nto the theatre--take a night off.\"\\n\"Thank you, your excellency.\"\\nThe secretary bowed and departed.\\nJulius stood at the door watching his retreat. Finally, with a\\nsatisfied sigh, he closed it, and came back to his position in\\nthe centre of the room.\\n\"Now, Mr. Hersheimmer, perhaps you will be so kind as to come to\\nthe point?\"\\n\"I guess that won\\'t take a minute,\" drawled Julius. Then, with\\nan abrupt change of manner: \"Hands up--or I shoot!\"\\nFor a moment Kramenin stared blindly into the big automatic,\\nthen, with almost comical haste, he flung up his hands above his\\nhead. In that instant Julius had taken his measure. The man he\\nhad to deal with was an abject physical coward--the rest would be\\neasy.\\n\"This is an outrage,\" cried the Russian in a high hysterical\\nvoice. \"An outrage! Do you mean to kill me?\"\\n\"Not if you keep your voice down. Don\\'t go edging sideways\\ntowards that bell. That\\'s better.\"\\n\"What do you want? Do nothing rashly. Remember my life is of\\nthe utmost value to my country. I may have been maligned----\"\\n\"I reckon,\" said Julius, \"that the man who let daylight into you\\nwould be doing humanity a good turn. But you needn\\'t worry any.\\nI\\'m not proposing to kill you this trip--that is, if you\\'re\\nreasonable.\"\\nThe Russian quailed before the stern menace in the other\\'s eyes.\\nHe passed his tongue over his dry lips.\\n\"What do you want? Money?\"\\n\"No. I want Jane Finn.\"\\n\"Jane Finn? I--never heard of her!\"\\n\"You\\'re a darned liar! You know perfectly who I mean.\"\\n\"I tell you I\\'ve never heard of the girl.\"\\n\"And I tell you,\" retorted Julius, \"that Little Willie here is\\njust hopping mad to go off!\"\\nThe Russian wilted visibly.\\n\"You wouldn\\'t dare----\"\\n\"Oh, yes, I would, son!\"\\nKramenin must have recognized something in the voice that carried\\nconviction, for he said sullenly:\\n\"Well? Granted I do know who you mean--what of it?\"\\n\"You will tell me now--right here--where she is to be found.\"\\nKramenin shook his head.\\n\"I daren\\'t.\"\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\"I daren\\'t. You ask an impossibility.\"\\n\"Afraid, eh? Of whom? Mr. Brown? Ah, that tickles you up!\\nThere is such a person, then? I doubted it. And the mere\\nmention of him scares you stiff!\"\\n\"I have seen him,\" said the Russian slowly. \"Spoken to him face\\nto face. I did not know it until afterwards. He was one of a\\ncrowd. I should not know him again. Who is he really? I do not\\nknow. But I know this--he is a man to fear.\"\\n\"He\\'ll never know,\" said Julius.\\n\"He knows everything--and his vengeance is swift. Even\\nI--Kramenin!--would not be exempt!\"\\n\"Then you won\\'t do as I ask you?\"\\n\"You ask an impossibility.\"\\n\"Sure that\\'s a pity for you,\" said Julius cheerfully. \"But the\\nworld in general will benefit.\" He raised the revolver.\\n\"Stop,\" shrieked the Russian. \"You cannot mean to shoot me?\"\\n\"Of course I do. I\\'ve always heard you Revolutionists held life\\ncheap, but it seems there\\'s a difference when it\\'s your own life\\nin question. I gave you just one chance of saving your dirty\\nskin, and that you wouldn\\'t take!\"\\n\"They would kill me!\"\\n\"Well,\" said Julius pleasantly, \"it\\'s up to you. But I\\'ll just\\nsay this. Little Willie here is a dead cert, and if I was you I\\'d\\ntake a sporting chance with Mr. Brown!\"\\n\"You will hang if you shoot me,\" muttered the Russian\\nirresolutely.\\n\"No, stranger, that\\'s where you\\'re wrong. You forget the\\ndollars. A big crowd of solicitors will get busy, and they\\'ll get\\nsome high-brow doctors on the job, and the end of it all will be\\nthat they\\'ll say my brain was unhinged. I shall spend a few\\nmonths in a quiet sanatorium, my mental health will improve, the\\ndoctors will declare me sane again, and all will end happily for\\nlittle Julius. I guess I can bear a few months\\' retirement in\\norder to rid the world of you, but don\\'t you kid yourself I\\'ll\\nhang for it!\"\\nThe Russian believed him. Corrupt himself, he believed\\nimplicitly in the power of money. He had read of American murder\\ntrials running much on the lines indicated by Julius. He had\\nbought and sold justice himself. This virile young American, with\\nthe significant drawling voice, had the whip hand of him.\\n\"I\\'m going to count five,\" continued Julius, \"and I guess, if you\\nlet me get past four, you needn\\'t worry any about Mr. Brown.\\nMaybe he\\'ll send some flowers to the funeral, but YOU won\\'t smell\\nthem! Are you ready? I\\'ll begin. One--two three--four----\"\\nThe Russian interrupted with a shriek:\\n\"Do not shoot. I will do all you wish.\"\\nJulius lowered the revolver.\\n\"I thought you\\'d hear sense. Where is the girl?\"\\n\"At Gatehouse, in Kent. Astley Priors, the place is called.\"\\n\"Is she a prisoner there?\"\\n\"She\\'s not allowed to leave the house--though it\\'s safe enough\\nreally. The little fool has lost her memory, curse her!\"\\n\"That\\'s been annoying for you and your friends, I reckon. What\\nabout the other girl, the one you decoyed away over a week ago?\"\\n\"She\\'s there too,\" said the Russian sullenly.\\n\"That\\'s good,\" said Julius. \"Isn\\'t it all panning out\\nbeautifully? And a lovely night for the run!\"\\n\"What run?\" demanded Kramenin, with a stare.\\n\"Down to Gatehouse, sure. I hope you\\'re fond of motoring?\"\\n\"What do you mean? I refuse to go.\"\\n\"Now don\\'t get mad. You must see I\\'m not such a kid as to leave\\nyou here. You\\'d ring up your friends on that telephone first\\nthing! Ah!\" He observed the fall on the other\\'s face. \"You\\nsee, you\\'d got it all fixed. No, sir, you\\'re coming along with\\nme. This your bedroom next door here? Walk right in. Little\\nWillie and I will come behind. Put on a thick coat, that\\'s\\nright. Fur lined? And you a Socialist! Now we\\'re ready. We\\nwalk downstairs and out through the hall to where my car\\'s\\nwaiting. And don\\'t you forget I\\'ve got you covered every inch of\\nthe way. I can shoot just as well through my coat pocket. One\\nword, or a glance even, at one of those liveried menials, and\\nthere\\'ll sure be a strange face in the Sulphur and Brimstone\\nWorks!\"\\nTogether they descended the stairs, and passed out to the waiting\\ncar. The Russian was shaking with rage. The hotel servants\\nsurrounded them. A cry hovered on his lips, but at the last\\nminute his nerve failed him. The American was a man of his word.\\nWhen they reached the car, Julius breathed a sigh of relief. The\\ndanger-zone was passed. Fear had successfully hypnotized the man\\nby his side.\\n\"Get in,\" he ordered. Then as he caught the other\\'s sidelong\\nglance, \"No, the chauffeur won\\'t help you any. Naval man. Was on\\na submarine in Russia when the Revolution broke out. A brother of\\nhis was murdered by your people. George!\"\\n\"Yes, sir?\" The chauffeur turned his head.\\n\"This gentleman is a Russian Bolshevik. We don\\'t want to shoot\\nhim, but it may be necessary. You understand?\"\\n\"Perfectly, sir.\"\\n\"I want to go to Gatehouse in Kent. Know the road at all?\"\\n\"Yes, sir, it will be about an hour and a half\\'s run.\"\\n\"Make it an hour. I\\'m in a hurry.\"\\n\"I\\'ll do my best, sir.\" The car shot forward through the\\ntraffic.\\nJulius ensconced himself comfortably by the side of his victim.\\nHe kept his hand in the pocket of his coat, but his manner was\\nurbane to the last degree.\\n\"There was a man I shot once in Arizona----\" he began cheerfully.\\nAt the end of the hour\\'s run the unfortunate Kramenin was more\\ndead than alive. In succession to the anecdote of the Arizona\\nman, there had been a tough from \\'Frisco, and an episode in the\\nRockies. Julius\\'s narrative style, if not strictly accurate, was\\npicturesque!\\nSlowing down, the chauffeur called over his shoulder that they\\nwere just coming into Gatehouse. Julius bade the Russian direct\\nthem. His plan was to drive straight up to the house. There\\nKramenin was to ask for the two girls. Julius explained to him\\nthat Little Willie would not be tolerant of failure. Kramenin, by\\nthis time, was as putty in the other\\'s hands. The terrific pace\\nthey had come had still further unmanned him. He had given\\nhimself up for dead at every corner.\\nThe car swept up the drive, and stopped before the porch. The\\nchauffeur looked round for orders.\\n\"Turn the car first, George. Then ring the bell, and get back to\\nyour place. Keep the engine going, and be ready to scoot like\\nhell when I give the word.\"\\n\"Very good, sir.\"\\nThe front door was opened by the butler. Kramenin felt the\\nmuzzle of the revolver pressed against his ribs.\\n\"Now,\" hissed Julius. \"And be careful.\"\\nThe Russian beckoned. His lips were white, and his voice was not\\nvery steady:\\n\"It is I--Kramenin! Bring down the girl at once! There is no\\ntime to lose!\"\\nWhittington had come down the steps. He uttered an exclamation\\nof astonishment at seeing the other.\\n\"You! What\\'s up? Surely you know the plan----\"\\nKramenin interrupted him, using the words that have created many\\nunnecessary panics:\\n\"We have been betrayed! Plans must be abandoned. We must save\\nour own skins. The girl! And at once! It\\'s our only chance.\"\\nWhittington hesitated, but for hardly a moment.\\n\"You have orders--from HIM?\"\\n\"Naturally! Should I be here otherwise? Hurry! There is no\\ntime to be lost. The other little fool had better come too.\"\\nWhittington turned and ran back into the house. The agonizing\\nminutes went by. Then--two figures hastily huddled in cloaks\\nappeared on the steps and were hustled into the car. The smaller\\nof the two was inclined to resist and Whittington shoved her in\\nunceremoniously. Julius leaned forward, and in doing so the\\nlight from the open door lit up his face. Another man on the\\nsteps behind Whittington gave a startled exclamation. Concealment\\nwas at an end.\\n\"Get a move on, George,\" shouted Julius.\\nThe chauffeur slipped in his clutch, and with a bound the car\\nstarted.\\nThe man on the steps uttered an oath. His hand went to his\\npocket. There was a flash and a report. The bullet just missed\\nthe taller girl by an inch.\\n\"Get down, Jane,\" cried Julius. \"Flat on the bottom of the car.\"\\nHe thrust her sharply forward, then standing up, he took careful\\naim and fired.\\n\"Have you hit him?\" cried Tuppence eagerly.\\n\"Sure,\" replied Julius. \"He isn\\'t killed, though. Skunks like\\nthat take a lot of killing. Are you all right, Tuppence?\"\\n\"Of course I am. Where\\'s Tommy? And who\\'s this?\" She indicated\\nthe shivering Kramenin.\\n\"Tommy\\'s making tracks for the Argentine. I guess he thought\\nyou\\'d turned up your toes. Steady through the gate, George!\\nThat\\'s right. It\\'ll take \\'em at least five minutes to get busy\\nafter us. They\\'ll use the telephone, I guess, so look out for\\nsnares ahead--and don\\'t take the direct route. Who\\'s this, did\\nyou say, Tuppence? Let me present Monsieur Kramenin. I\\npersuaded him to come on the trip for his health.\"\\nThe Russian remained mute, still livid with terror.\\n\"But what made them let us go?\" demanded Tuppence suspiciously.\\n\"I reckon Monsieur Kramenin here asked them so prettily they just\\ncouldn\\'t refuse!\"\\nThis was too much for the Russian. He burst out vehemently:\\n\"Curse you--curse you! They know now that I betrayed them. My\\nlife won\\'t be safe for an hour in this country.\"\\n\"That\\'s so,\" assented Julius. \"I\\'d advise you to make tracks for\\nRussia right away.\"\\n\"Let me go, then,\" cried the other. \"I have done what you asked.\\nWhy do you still keep me with you?\"\\n\"Not for the pleasure of your company. I guess you can get right\\noff now if you want to. I thought you\\'d rather I tooled you back\\nto London.\"\\n\"You may never reach London,\" snarled the other. \"Let me go here\\nand now.\"\\n\"Sure thing. Pull up, George. The gentleman\\'s not making the\\nreturn trip. If I ever come to Russia, Monsieur Kramenin, I shall\\nexpect a rousing welcome, and----\"\\nBut before Julius had finished his speech, and before the car had\\nfinally halted, the Russian had swung himself out and disappeared\\ninto the night.\\n\"Just a mite impatient to leave us,\" commented Julius, as the car\\ngathered way again. \"And no idea of saying good-bye politely to\\nthe ladies. Say, Jane, you can get up on the seat now.\"\\nFor the first time the girl spoke.\\n\"How did you \\'persuade\\' him?\" she asked.\\nJulius tapped his revolver.\\n\"Little Willie here takes the credit!\"\\n\"Splendid!\" cried the girl. The colour surged into her face, her\\neyes looked admiringly at Julius.\\n\"Annette and I didn\\'t know what was going to happen to us,\" said\\nTuppence. \"Old Whittington hurried us off. We thought it was\\nlambs to the slaughter.\"\\n\"Annette,\" said Julius. \"Is that what you call her?\"\\nHis mind seemed to be trying to adjust itself to a new idea.\\n\"It\\'s her name,\" said Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide.\\n\"Shucks!\" retorted Julius. \"She may think it\\'s her name, because\\nher memory\\'s gone, poor kid. But it\\'s the one real and original\\nJane Finn we\\'ve got here.\"\\n\"What?\" cried Tuppence.\\nBut she was interrupted. With an angry spurt, a bullet embedded\\nitself in the upholstery of the car just behind her head.\\n\"Down with you,\" cried Julius. \"It\\'s an ambush. These guys have\\ngot busy pretty quickly. Push her a bit, George.\"\\nThe car fairly leapt forward. Three more shots rang out, but\\nwent happily wide. Julius, upright, leant over the back of the\\ncar.\\n\"Nothing to shoot at,\" he announced gloomily. \"But I guess\\nthere\\'ll be another little picnic soon. Ah!\"\\nHe raised his hand to his cheek.\\n\"You are hurt?\" said Annette quickly.\\n\"Only a scratch.\"\\nThe girl sprang to her feet.\\n\"Let me out! Let me out, I say! Stop the car. It is me they\\'re\\nafter. I\\'m the one they want. You shall not lose your lives\\nbecause of me. Let me go.\" She was fumbling with the fastenings\\nof the door.\\nJulius took her by both arms, and looked at her. She had spoken\\nwith no trace of foreign accent.\\n\"Sit down, kid,\" he said gently. \"I guess there\\'s nothing wrong\\nwith your memory. Been fooling them all the time, eh?\"\\nThe girl looked at him, nodded, and then suddenly burst into\\ntears. Julius patted her on the shoulder.\\n\"There, there--just you sit tight. We\\'re not going to let you\\nquit.\"\\nThrough her sobs the girl said indistinctly:\\n\"You\\'re from home. I can tell by your voice. It makes me\\nhome-sick.\"\\n\"Sure I\\'m from home. I\\'m your cousin--Julius Hersheimmer. I\\ncame over to Europe on purpose to find you--and a pretty dance\\nyou\\'ve led me.\"\\nThe car slackened speed. George spoke over his shoulder:\\n\"Cross-roads here, sir. I\\'m not sure of the way.\"\\nThe car slowed down till it hardly moved. As it did so a figure\\nclimbed suddenly over the back, and plunged head first into the\\nmidst of them.\\n\"Sorry,\" said Tommy, extricating himself.\\nA mass of confused exclamations greeted him. He replied to them\\nseverally:\\n\"Was in the bushes by the drive. Hung on behind. Couldn\\'t let\\nyou know before at the pace you were going. It was all I could\\ndo to hang on. Now then, you girls, get out!\"\\n\"Get out?\"\\n\"Yes. There\\'s a station just up that road. Train due in three\\nminutes. You\\'ll catch it if you hurry.\"\\n\"What the devil are you driving at?\" demanded Julius. \"Do you\\nthink you can fool them by leaving the car?\"\\n\"You and I aren\\'t going to leave the car. Only the girls.\"\\n\"You\\'re crazed, Beresford. Stark staring mad! You can\\'t let\\nthose girls go off alone. It\\'ll be the end of it if you do.\"\\nTommy turned to Tuppence.\\n\"Get out at once, Tuppence. Take her with you, and do just as I\\nsay. No one will do you any harm. You\\'re safe. Take the train\\nto London. Go straight to Sir James Peel Edgerton. Mr. Carter\\nlives out of town, but you\\'ll be safe with him.\"\\n\"Darn you!\" cried Julius. \"You\\'re mad. Jane, you stay where you\\nare.\"\\nWith a sudden swift movement, Tommy snatched the revolver from\\nJulius\\'s hand, and levelled it at him.\\n\"Now will you believe I\\'m in earnest? Get out, both of you, and\\ndo as I say--or I\\'ll shoot!\"\\nTuppence sprang out, dragging the unwilling Jane after her.\\n\"Come on, it\\'s all right. If Tommy\\'s sure--he\\'s sure. Be quick.\\nWe\\'ll miss the train.\"\\nThey started running.\\nJulius\\'s pent-up rage burst forth.\\n\"What the hell----\"\\nTommy interrupted him.\\n\"Dry up! I want a few words with you, Mr. Julius Hersheimmer.\"\\nCHAPTER\\nXXV\\nJANE\\'S STORY\\nHER arm through Jane\\'s, dragging her along, Tuppence reached the\\nstation. Her quick ears caught the sound of the approaching\\ntrain.\\n\"Hurry up,\" she panted, \"or we\\'ll miss it.\"\\nThey arrived on the platform just as the train came to a\\nstandstill. Tuppence opened the door of an empty first-class\\ncompartment, and the two girls sank down breathless on the padded\\nseats.\\nA man looked in, then passed on to the next carriage. Jane\\nstarted nervously. Her eyes dilated with terror. She looked\\nquestioningly at Tuppence.\\n\"Is he one of them, do you think?\" she breathed.\\nTuppence shook her head.\\n\"No, no. It\\'s all right.\" She took Jane\\'s hand in hers. \"Tommy\\nwouldn\\'t have told us to do this unless he was sure we\\'d be all\\nright.\"\\n\"But he doesn\\'t know them as I do!\" The girl shivered. \"You\\ncan\\'t understand. Five years! Five long years! Sometimes I\\nthought I should go mad.\"\\n\"Never mind. It\\'s all over.\"\\n\"Is it?\"\\nThe train was moving now, speeding through the night at a\\ngradually increasing rate. Suddenly Jane Finn started up.\\n\"What was that? I thought I saw a face--looking in through the\\nwindow.\"\\n\"No, there\\'s nothing. See.\" Tuppence went to the window, and\\nlifting the strap let the pane down.\\n\"You\\'re sure?\"\\n\"Quite sure.\"\\nThe other seemed to feel some excuse was necessary:\\n\"I guess I\\'m acting like a frightened rabbit, but I can\\'t help\\nit. If they caught me now they\\'d----\" Her eyes opened wide and\\nstaring.\\n\"DON\\'T!\" implored Tuppence. \"Lie back, and DON\\'T THINK. You can\\nbe quite sure that Tommy wouldn\\'t have said it was safe if it\\nwasn\\'t.\"\\n\"My cousin didn\\'t think so. He didn\\'t want us to do this.\"\\n\"No,\" said Tuppence, rather embarrassed.\\n\"What are you thinking of?\" said Jane sharply.\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Your voice was so--queer!\"\\n\"I WAS thinking of something,\" confessed Tuppence. \"But I don\\'t\\nwant to tell you--not now. I may be wrong, but I don\\'t think so.\\nIt\\'s just an idea that came into my head a long time ago. Tommy\\'s\\ngot it too--I\\'m almost sure he has. But don\\'t YOU\\nworry--there\\'ll be time enough for that later. And it mayn\\'t be\\nso at all! Do what I tell you--lie back and don\\'t think of\\nanything.\"\\n\"I\\'ll try.\" The long lashes drooped over the hazel eyes.\\nTuppence, for her part, sat bolt upright--much in the attitude of\\na watchful terrier on guard. In spite of herself she was\\nnervous. Her eyes flashed continually from one window to the\\nother. She noted the exact position of the communication cord.\\nWhat it was that she feared, she would have been hard put to it\\nto say. But in her own mind she was far from feeling the\\nconfidence displayed in her words. Not that she disbelieved in\\nTommy, but occasionally she was shaken with doubts as to whether\\nanyone so simple and honest as he was could ever be a match for\\nthe fiendish subtlety of the arch-criminal.\\nIf they once reached Sir James Peel Edgerton in safety, all would\\nbe well. But would they reach him? Would not the silent forces\\nof Mr. Brown already be assembling against them? Even that last\\npicture of Tommy, revolver in hand, failed to comfort her. By\\nnow he might be overpowered, borne down by sheer force of\\nnumbers.... Tuppence mapped out her plan of campaign.\\nAs the train at length drew slowly into Charing Cross, Jane Finn\\nsat up with a start.\\n\"Have we arrived? I never thought we should!\"\\n\"Oh, I thought we\\'d get to London all right. If there\\'s going to\\nbe any fun, now is when it will begin. Quick, get out. We\\'ll nip\\ninto a taxi.\"\\nIn another minute they were passing the barrier, had paid the\\nnecessary fares, and were stepping into a taxi.\\n\"King\\'s Cross,\" directed Tuppence. Then she gave a jump. A man\\nlooked in at the window, just as they started. She was almost\\ncertain it was the same man who had got into the carriage next to\\nthem. She had a horrible feeling of being slowly hemmed in on\\nevery side.\\n\"You see,\" she explained to Jane, \"if they think we\\'re going to\\nSir James, this will put them off the scent. Now they\\'ll imagine\\nwe\\'re going to Mr. Carter. His country place is north of London\\nsomewhere.\"\\nCrossing Holborn there was a block, and the taxi was held up.\\nThis was what Tuppence had been waiting for.\\n\"Quick,\" she whispered. \"Open the right-hand door!\"\\nThe two girls stepped out into the traffic. Two minutes later\\nthey were seated in another taxi and were retracing their steps,\\nthis time direct to Carlton House Terrace.\\n\"There,\" said Tuppence, with great satisfaction, \"this ought to\\ndo them. I can\\'t help thinking that I\\'m really rather clever!\\nHow that other taxi man will swear! But I took his number, and\\nI\\'ll send him a postal order to-morrow, so that he won\\'t lose by\\nit if he happens to be genuine. What\\'s this thing\\nswerving----Oh!\"\\nThere was a grinding noise and a bump. Another taxi had collided\\nwith them.\\nIn a flash Tuppence was out on the pavement. A policeman was\\napproaching. Before he arrived Tuppence had handed the driver\\nfive shillings, and she and Jane had merged themselves in the\\ncrowd.\\n\"It\\'s only a step or two now,\" said Tuppence breathlessly. The\\naccident had taken place in Trafalgar Square.\\n\"Do you think the collision was an accident, or done\\ndeliberately?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know. It might have been either.\"\\nHand-in-hand, the two girls hurried along.\\n\"It may be my fancy,\" said Tuppence suddenly, \"but I feel as\\nthough there was some one behind us.\"\\n\"Hurry!\" murmured the other. \"Oh, hurry!\"\\nThey were now at the corner of Carlton House Terrace, and their\\nspirits lightened. Suddenly a large and apparently intoxicated\\nman barred their way.\\n\"Good evening, ladies,\" he hiccupped. \"Whither away so fast?\"\\n\"Let us pass, please,\" said Tuppence imperiously.\\n\"Just a word with your pretty friend here.\" He stretched out an\\nunsteady hand, and clutched Jane by the shoulder. Tuppence heard\\nother footsteps behind. She did not pause to ascertain whether\\nthey were friends or foes. Lowering her head, she repeated a\\nmanoeuvre of childish days, and butted their aggressor full in\\nthe capacious middle. The success of these unsportsmanlike\\ntactics was immediate. The man sat down abruptly on the pavement.\\nTuppence and Jane took to their heels. The house they sought was\\nsome way down. Other footsteps echoed behind them. Their breath\\nwas coming in choking gasps as they reached Sir James\\'s door.\\nTuppence seized the bell and Jane the knocker.\\nThe man who had stopped them reached the foot of the steps. For a\\nmoment he hesitated, and as he did so the door opened. They fell\\ninto the hall together. Sir James came forward from the library\\ndoor.\\n\"Hullo! What\\'s this?\"\\nHe stepped forward, and put his arm round Jane as she swayed\\nuncertainly. He half carried her into the library, and laid her\\non the leather couch. From a tantalus on the table he poured out\\na few drops of brandy, and forced her to drink them. With a sigh\\nshe sat up, her eyes still wild and frightened.\\n\"It\\'s all right. Don\\'t be afraid, my child. You\\'re quite safe.\"\\nHer breath came more normally, and the colour was returning to\\nher cheeks. Sir James looked at Tuppence quizzically.\\n\"So you\\'re not dead, Miss Tuppence, any more than that Tommy boy\\nof yours was!\"\\n\"The Young Adventurers take a lot of killing,\" boasted Tuppence.\\n\"So it seems,\" said Sir James dryly. \"Am I right in thinking\\nthat the joint venture has ended in success, and that this\"--he\\nturned to the girl on the couch--\"is Miss Jane Finn?\"\\nJane sat up.\\n\"Yes,\" she said quietly, \"I am Jane Finn. I have a lot to tell\\nyou.\"\\n\"When you are stronger----\"\\n\"No--now!\" Her voice rose a little. \"I shall feel safer when I\\nhave told everything.\"\\n\"As you please,\" said the lawyer.\\nHe sat down in one of the big arm-chairs facing the couch. In a\\nlow voice Jane began her story.\\n\"I came over on the Lusitania to take up a post in Paris. I was\\nfearfully keen about the war, and just dying to help somehow or\\nother. I had been studying French, and my teacher said they were\\nwanting help in a hospital in Paris, so I wrote and offered my\\nservices, and they were accepted. I hadn\\'t got any folk of my\\nown, so it made it easy to arrange things.\\n\"When the Lusitania was torpedoed, a man came up to me. I\\'d\\nnoticed him more than once--and I\\'d figured it out in my own mind\\nthat he was afraid of somebody or something. He asked me if I\\nwas a patriotic American, and told me he was carrying papers\\nwhich were just life or death to the Allies. He asked me to take\\ncharge of them. I was to watch for an advertisement in the Times.\\nIf it didn\\'t appear, I was to take them to the American\\nAmbassador.\\n\"Most of what followed seems like a nightmare still. I see it in\\nmy dreams sometimes.... I\\'ll hurry over that part. Mr. Danvers\\nhad told me to watch out. He might have been shadowed from New\\nYork, but he didn\\'t think so. At first I had no suspicions, but\\non the boat to Holyhead I began to get uneasy. There was one\\nwoman who had been very keen to look after me, and chum up with\\nme generally--a Mrs. Vandemeyer. At first I\\'d been only grateful\\nto her for being so kind to me; but all the time I felt there was\\nsomething about her I didn\\'t like, and on the Irish boat I saw\\nher talking to some queer-looking men, and from the way they\\nlooked I saw that they were talking about me. I remembered that\\nshe\\'d been quite near me on the Lusitania when Mr. Danvers gave\\nme the packet, and before that she\\'d tried to talk to him once or\\ntwice. I began to get scared, but I didn\\'t quite see what to do.\\n\"I had a wild idea of stopping at Holyhead, and not going on to\\nLondon that day, but I soon saw that that would be plumb\\nfoolishness. The only thing was to act as though I\\'d noticed\\nnothing, and hope for the best. I couldn\\'t see how they could\\nget me if I was on my guard. One thing I\\'d done already as a\\nprecaution--ripped open the oilskin packet and substituted blank\\npaper, and then sewn it up again. So, if anyone did manage to rob\\nme of it, it wouldn\\'t matter.\\n\"What to do with the real thing worried me no end. Finally I\\nopened it out flat--there were only two sheets--and laid it\\nbetween two of the advertisement pages of a magazine. I stuck the\\ntwo pages together round the edge with some gum off an envelope.\\nI carried the magazine carelessly stuffed into the pocket of my\\nulster.\\n\"At Holyhead I tried to get into a carriage with people that\\nlooked all right, but in a queer way there seemed always to be a\\ncrowd round me shoving and pushing me just the way I didn\\'t want\\nto go. There was something uncanny and frightening about it. In\\nthe end I found myself in a carriage with Mrs. Vandemeyer after\\nall. I went out into the corridor, but all the other carriages\\nwere full, so I had to go back and sit down. I consoled myself\\nwith the thought that there were other people in the\\ncarriage--there was quite a nice-looking man and his wife sitting\\njust opposite. So I felt almost happy about it until just outside\\nLondon. I had leaned back and closed my eyes. I guess they\\nthought I was asleep, but my eyes weren\\'t quite shut, and\\nsuddenly I saw the nice-looking man get something out of his bag\\nand hand it to Mrs. Vandemeyer, and as he did so he WINKED....\\n\"I can\\'t tell you how that wink sort of froze me through and\\nthrough. My only thought was to get out in the corridor as quick\\nas ever I could. I got up, trying to look natural and easy.\\nPerhaps they saw something--I don\\'t know--but suddenly Mrs.\\nVandemeyer said \\'Now,\\' and flung something over my nose and mouth\\nas I tried to scream. At the same moment I felt a terrific blow\\non the back of my head....\"\\nShe shuddered. Sir James murmured something sympathetically. In\\na minute she resumed:\\n\"I don\\'t know how long it was before I came back to\\nconsciousness. I felt very ill and sick. I was lying on a dirty\\nbed. There was a screen round it, but I could hear two people\\ntalking in the room. Mrs. Vandemeyer was one of them. I tried to\\nlisten, but at first I couldn\\'t take much in. When at last I did\\nbegin to grasp what was going on--I was just terrified! I wonder\\nI didn\\'t scream right out there and then.\\n\"They hadn\\'t found the papers. They\\'d got the oilskin packet\\nwith the blanks, and they were just mad! They didn\\'t know\\nwhether I\\'d changed the papers, or whether Danvers had been\\ncarrying a dummy message, while the real one was sent another\\nway. They spoke of\"--she closed her eyes--\"torturing me to find\\nout!\\n\"I\\'d never known what fear--really sickening fear--was before!\\nOnce they came to look at me. I shut my eyes and pretended to be\\nstill unconscious, but I was afraid they\\'d hear the beating of my\\nheart. However, they went away again. I began thinking madly.\\nWhat could I do? I knew I wouldn\\'t be able to stand up against\\ntorture very long.\\n\"Suddenly something put the thought of loss of memory into my\\nhead. The subject had always interested me, and I\\'d read an awful\\nlot about it. I had the whole thing at my finger-tips. If only I\\ncould succeed in carrying the bluff through, it might save me. I\\nsaid a prayer, and drew a long breath. Then I opened my eyes and\\nstarted babbling in FRENCH!\\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer came round the screen at once. Her face was so\\nwicked I nearly died, but I smiled up at her doubtfully, and\\nasked her in French where I was.\\n\"It puzzled her, I could see. She called the man she had been\\ntalking to. He stood by the screen with his face in shadow. He\\nspoke to me in French. His voice was very ordinary and quiet,\\nbut somehow, I don\\'t know why, he scared me worse than the woman.\\nI felt he\\'d seen right through me, but I went on playing my part.\\nI asked again where I was, and then went on that there was\\nsomething I MUST remember--MUST remember--only for the moment it\\nwas all gone. I worked myself up to be more and more distressed.\\nHe asked me my name. I said I didn\\'t know--that I couldn\\'t\\nremember anything at all.\\n\"Suddenly he caught my wrist, and began twisting it. The pain\\nwas awful. I screamed. He went on. I screamed and screamed, but\\nI managed to shriek out things in French. I don\\'t know how long\\nI could have gone on, but luckily I fainted. The last thing I\\nheard was his voice saying: \\'That\\'s not bluff! Anyway, a kid of\\nher age wouldn\\'t know enough.\\' I guess he forgot American girls\\nare older for their age than English ones, and take more interest\\nin scientific subjects.\\n\"When I came to, Mrs. Vandemeyer was sweet as honey to me. She\\'d\\nhad her orders, I guess. She spoke to me in French--told me I\\'d\\nhad a shock and been very ill. I should be better soon. I\\npretended to be rather dazed--murmured something about the\\n\\'doctor\\' having hurt my wrist. She looked relieved when I said\\nthat.\\n\"By and by she went out of the room altogether. I was suspicious\\nstill, and lay quite quiet for some time. In the end, however, I\\ngot up and walked round the room, examining it. I thought that\\neven if anyone WAS watching me from somewhere, it would seem\\nnatural enough under the circumstances. It was a squalid, dirty\\nplace. There were no windows, which seemed queer. I guessed the\\ndoor would be locked, but I didn\\'t try it. There were some\\nbattered old pictures on the walls, representing scenes from\\nFaust.\"\\nJane\\'s two listeners gave a simultaneous \"Ah!\" The girl nodded.\\n\"Yes--it was the place in Soho where Mr. Beresford was\\nimprisoned. Of course, at the time I didn\\'t even know if I was in\\nLondon. One thing was worrying me dreadfully, but my heart gave\\na great throb of relief when I saw my ulster lying carelessly\\nover the back of a chair. AND THE MAGAZINE WAS STILL ROLLED UP IN\\nTHE POCKET!\\n\"If only I could be certain that I was not being overlooked! I\\nlooked carefully round the walls. There didn\\'t seem to be a\\npeep-hole of any kind--nevertheless I felt kind of sure there\\nmust be. All of a sudden I sat down on the edge of the table, and\\nput my face in my hands, sobbing out a \\'Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!\\'\\nI\\'ve got very sharp ears. I distinctly heard the rustle of a\\ndress, and slight creak. That was enough for me. I was being\\nwatched!\\n\"I lay down on the bed again, and by and by Mrs. Vandemeyer\\nbrought me some supper. She was still sweet as they make them. I\\nguess she\\'d been told to win my confidence. Presently she\\nproduced the oilskin packet, and asked me if I recognized it,\\nwatching me like a lynx all the time.\\n\"I took it and turned it over in a puzzled sort of way. Then I\\nshook my head. I said that I felt I OUGHT to remember something\\nabout it, that it was just as though it was all coming back, and\\nthen, before I could get hold of it, it went again. Then she told\\nme that I was her niece, and that I was to call her \\'Aunt Rita.\\'\\nI did obediently, and she told me not to worry--my memory would\\nsoon come back.\\n\"That was an awful night. I\\'d made my plan whilst I was waiting\\nfor her. The papers were safe so far, but I couldn\\'t take the\\nrisk of leaving them there any longer. They might throw that\\nmagazine away any minute. I lay awake waiting until I judged it\\nmust be about two o\\'clock in the morning. Then I got up as\\nsoftly as I could, and felt in the dark along the left-hand wall.\\nVery gently, I unhooked one of the pictures from its\\nnail--Marguerite with her casket of jewels. I crept over to my\\ncoat and took out the magazine, and an odd envelope or two that I\\nhad shoved in. Then I went to the washstand, and damped the\\nbrown paper at the back of the picture all round. Presently I was\\nable to pull it away. I had already torn out the two\\nstuck-together pages from the magazine, and now I slipped them\\nwith their precious enclosure between the picture and its brown\\npaper backing. A little gum from the envelopes helped me to stick\\nthe latter up again. No one would dream the picture had ever been\\ntampered with. I rehung it on the wall, put the magazine back in\\nmy coat pocket, and crept back to bed. I was pleased with my\\nhiding-place. They\\'d never think of pulling to pieces one of\\ntheir own pictures. I hoped that they\\'d come to the conclusion\\nthat Danvers had been carrying a dummy all along, and that, in\\nthe end, they\\'d let me go.\\n\"As a matter of fact, I guess that\\'s what they did think at\\nfirst, and, in a way, it was dangerous for me. I learnt\\nafterwards that they nearly did away with me then and\\nthere--there was never much chance of their \\'letting me go\\'--but\\nthe first man, who was the boss, preferred to keep me alive on\\nthe chance of my having hidden them, and being able to tell where\\nif I recovered my memory. They watched me constantly for weeks.\\nSometimes they\\'d ask me questions by the hour--I guess there was\\nnothing they didn\\'t know about the third degree!--but somehow I\\nmanaged to hold my own. The strain of it was awful, though . . .\\n\"They took me back to Ireland, and over every step of the Journey\\nagain, in case I\\'d hidden it somewhere en route. Mrs. Vandemeyer\\nand another woman never left me for a moment. They spoke of me as\\na young relative of Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s whose mind was affected by\\nthe shock of the Lusitania. There was no one I could appeal to\\nfor help without giving myself away to THEM, and if I risked it\\nand failed--and Mrs. Vandemeyer looked so rich, and so\\nbeautifully dressed, that I felt convinced they\\'d take her word\\nagainst mine, and think it was part of my mental trouble to think\\nmyself \\'persecuted\\'--I felt that the horrors in store for me\\nwould be too awful once they knew I\\'d been only shamming.\"\\nSir James nodded comprehendingly.\\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer was a woman of great personality. With that and\\nher social position she would have had little difficulty in\\nimposing her point of view in preference to yours. Your\\nsensational accusations against her would not easily have found\\ncredence.\"\\n\"That\\'s what I thought. It ended in my being sent to a\\nsanatorium at Bournemouth. I couldn\\'t make up my mind at first\\nwhether it was a sham affair or genuine. A hospital nurse had\\ncharge of me. I was a special patient. She seemed so nice and\\nnormal that at last I determined to confide in her. A merciful\\nprovidence just saved me in time from falling into the trap. My\\ndoor happened to be ajar, and I heard her talking to some one in\\nthe passage. SHE WAS ONE OF THEM! They still fancied it might be\\na bluff on my part, and she was put in charge of me to make sure!\\nAfter that, my nerve went completely. I dared trust nobody.\\n\"I think I almost hypnotized myself. After a while, I almost\\nforgot that I was really Jane Finn. I was so bent on playing the\\npart of Janet Vandemeyer that my nerves began to play me tricks.\\nI became really ill--for months I sank into a sort of stupor. I\\nfelt sure I should die soon, and that nothing really mattered. A\\nsane person shut up in a lunatic asylum often ends by becoming\\ninsane, they say. I guess I was like that. Playing my part had\\nbecome second nature to me. I wasn\\'t even unhappy in the\\nend--just apathetic. Nothing seemed to matter. And the years\\nwent on.\\n\"And then suddenly things seemed to change. Mrs. Vandemeyer came\\ndown from London. She and the doctor asked me questions,\\nexperimented with various treatments. There was some talk of\\nsending me to a specialist in Paris. In the end, they did not\\ndare risk it. I overheard something that seemed to show that\\nother people--friends--were looking for me. I learnt later that\\nthe nurse who had looked after me went to Paris, and consulted a\\nspecialist, representing herself to be me. He put her through\\nsome searching tests, and exposed her loss of memory to be\\nfraudulent; but she had taken a note of his methods and\\nreproduced them on me. I dare say I couldn\\'t have deceived the\\nspecialist for a minute--a man who has made a lifelong study of a\\nthing is unique--but I managed once again to hold my own with\\nthem. The fact that I\\'d not thought of myself as Jane Finn for so\\nlong made it easier.\\n\"One night I was whisked off to London at a moment\\'s notice. They\\ntook me back to the house in Soho. Once I got away from the\\nsanatorium I felt different--as though something in me that had\\nbeen buried for a long time was waking up again.\\n\"They sent me in to wait on Mr. Beresford. (Of course I didn\\'t\\nknow his name then.) I was suspicious--I thought it was another\\ntrap. But he looked so honest, I could hardly believe it.\\nHowever, I was careful in all I said, for I knew we could be\\noverheard. There\\'s a small hole, high up in the wall.\\n\"But on the Sunday afternoon a message was brought to the house.\\nThey were all very disturbed. Without their knowing, I listened.\\nWord had come that he was to be killed. I needn\\'t tell the next\\npart, because you know it. I thought I\\'d have time to rush up\\nand get the papers from their hiding-place, but I was caught. So\\nI screamed out that he was escaping, and I said I wanted to go\\nback to Marguerite. I shouted the name three times very loud. I\\nknew the others would think I meant Mrs. Vandemeyer, but I hoped\\nit might make Mr. Beresford think of the picture. He\\'d unhooked\\none the first day--that\\'s what made me hesitate to trust him.\"\\nShe paused.\\n\"Then the papers,\" said Sir James slowly, \"are still at the back\\nof the picture in that room.\"\\n\"Yes.\" The girl had sunk back on the sofa exhausted with the\\nstrain of the long story.\\nSir James rose to his feet. He looked at his watch.\\n\"Come,\" he said, \"we must go at once.\"\\n\"To-night?\" queried Tuppence, surprised.\\n\"To-morrow may be too late,\" said Sir James gravely. \"Besides, by\\ngoing to-night we have the chance of capturing that great man and\\nsuper-criminal--Mr. Brown!\"\\nThere was dead silence, and Sir James continued:\\n\"You have been followed here--not a doubt of it. When we leave\\nthe house we shall be followed again, but not molested, FOR IT IS\\nMR. BROWN\\'S PLAN THAT WE ARE TO LEAD HIM. But the Soho house is\\nunder police supervision night and day. There are several men\\nwatching it. When we enter that house, Mr. Brown will not draw\\nback--he will risk all, on the chance of obtaining the spark to\\nfire his mine. And he fancies the risk not great--since he will\\nenter in the guise of a friend!\"\\nTuppence flushed, then opened her mouth impulsively.\\n\"But there\\'s something you don\\'t know--that we haven\\'t told you.\"\\nHer eyes dwelt on Jane in perplexity.\\n\"What is that?\" asked the other sharply. \"No hesitations, Miss\\nTuppence. We need to be sure of our going.\"\\nBut Tuppence, for once, seemed tongue-tied.\\n\"It\\'s so difficult--you see, if I\\'m wrong--oh, it would be\\ndreadful.\" She made a grimace at the unconscious Jane. \"Never\\nforgive me,\" she observed cryptically.\\n\"You want me to help you out, eh?\"\\n\"Yes, please. YOU know who Mr. Brown is, don\\'t you?\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Sir James gravely. \"At last I do.\"\\n\"At last?\" queried Tuppence doubtfully. \"Oh, but I thought----\"\\nShe paused.\\n\"You thought correctly, Miss Tuppence. I have been morally\\ncertain of his identity for some time--ever since the night of\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s mysterious death.\"\\n\"Ah!\" breathed Tuppence.\\n\"For there we are up against the logic of facts. There are only\\ntwo solutions. Either the chloral was administered by her own\\nhand, which theory I reject utterly, or else----\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"Or else it was administered in the brandy you gave her. Only\\nthree people touched that brandy--you, Miss Tuppence, I myself,\\nand one other--Mr. Julius Hersheimmer!\"\\nJane Finn stirred and sat up, regarding the speaker with wide\\nastonished eyes.\\n\"At first, the thing seemed utterly impossible. Mr. Hersheimmer,\\nas the son of a prominent millionaire, was a well-known figure in\\nAmerica. It seemed utterly impossible that he and Mr. Brown\\ncould be one and the same. But you cannot escape from the logic\\nof facts. Since the thing was so--it must be accepted. Remember\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s sudden and inexplicable agitation. Another\\nproof, if proof was needed.\\n\"I took an early opportunity of giving you a hint. From some\\nwords of Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s at Manchester, I gathered that you had\\nunderstood and acted on that hint. Then I set to work to prove\\nthe impossible possible. Mr. Beresford rang me up and told me,\\nwhat I had already suspected, that the photograph of Miss Jane\\nFinn had never really been out of Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s\\npossession----\"\\nBut the girl interrupted. Springing to her feet, she cried out\\nangrily:\\n\"What do you mean? What are you trying to suggest? That Mr.\\nBrown is JULIUS? Julius--my own cousin!\"\\n\"No, Miss Finn,\" said Sir James unexpectedly. \"Not your cousin.\\nThe man who calls himself Julius Hersheimmer is no relation to\\nyou whatsoever.\"\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\nMR. BROWN\\nSIR James\\'s words came like a bomb-shell. Both girls looked\\nequally puzzled. The lawyer went across to his desk, and returned\\nwith a small newspaper cutting, which he handed to Jane.\\nTuppence read it over her shoulder. Mr. Carter would have\\nrecognized it. It referred to the mysterious man found dead in\\nNew York.\\n\"As I was saying to Miss Tuppence,\" resumed the lawyer, \"I set to\\nwork to prove the impossible possible. The great stumbling-block\\nwas the undeniable fact that Julius Hersheimmer was not an\\nassumed name. When I came across this paragraph my problem was\\nsolved. Julius Hersheimmer set out to discover what had become of\\nhis cousin. He went out West, where he obtained news of her and\\nher photograph to aid him in his search. On the eve of his\\ndeparture from New York he was set upon and murdered. His body\\nwas dressed in shabby clothes, and the face disfigured to prevent\\nidentification. Mr. Brown took his place. He sailed immediately\\nfor England. None of the real Hersheimmer\\'s friends or intimates\\nsaw him before he sailed--though indeed it would hardly have\\nmattered if they had, the impersonation was so perfect. Since\\nthen he had been hand and glove with those sworn to hunt him\\ndown. Every secret of theirs has been known to him. Only once\\ndid he come near disaster. Mrs. Vandemeyer knew his secret. It\\nwas no part of his plan that that huge bribe should ever be\\noffered to her. But for Miss Tuppence\\'s fortunate change of\\nplan, she would have been far away from the flat when we arrived\\nthere. Exposure stared him in the face. He took a desperate\\nstep, trusting in his assumed character to avert suspicion. He\\nnearly succeeded--but not quite.\"\\n\"I can\\'t believe it,\" murmured Jane. \"He seemed so splendid.\"\\n\"The real Julius Hersheimmer WAS a splendid fellow! And Mr. Brown\\nis a consummate actor. But ask Miss Tuppence if she also has not\\nhad her suspicions.\"\\nJane turned mutely to Tuppence. The latter nodded.\\n\"I didn\\'t want to say it, Jane--I knew it would hurt you. And,\\nafter all, I couldn\\'t be sure. I still don\\'t understand why, if\\nhe\\'s Mr. Brown, he rescued us.\"\\n\"Was it Julius Hersheimmer who helped you to escape?\"\\nTuppence recounted to Sir James the exciting events of the\\nevening, ending up: \"But I can\\'t see WHY!\"\\n\"Can\\'t you? I can. So can young Beresford, by his actions. As a\\nlast hope Jane Finn was to be allowed to escape--and the escape\\nmust be managed so that she harbours no suspicions of its being a\\nput-up job. They\\'re not averse to young Beresford\\'s being in the\\nneighbourhood, and, if necessary, communicating with you. They\\'ll\\ntake care to get him out of the way at the right minute. Then\\nJulius Hersheimmer dashes up and rescues you in true melodramatic\\nstyle. Bullets fly--but don\\'t hit anybody. What would have\\nhappened next? You would have driven straight to the house in\\nSoho and secured the document which Miss Finn would probably have\\nentrusted to her cousin\\'s keeping. Or, if he conducted the\\nsearch, he would have pretended to find the hiding-place already\\nrifled. He would have had a dozen ways of dealing with the\\nsituation, but the result would have been the same. And I rather\\nfancy some accident would have happened to both of you. You see,\\nyou know rather an inconvenient amount. That\\'s a rough outline.\\nI admit I was caught napping; but somebody else wasn\\'t.\"\\n\"Tommy,\" said Tuppence softly.\\n\"Yes. Evidently when the right moment came to get rid of him--he\\nwas too sharp for them. All the same, I\\'m not too easy in my\\nmind about him.\"\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Because Julius Hersheimmer is Mr. Brown,\" said Sir James dryly.\\n\"And it takes more than one man and a revolver to hold up Mr.\\nBrown....\"\\nTuppence paled a little.\\n\"What can we do?\"\\n\"Nothing until we\\'ve been to the house in Soho. If Beresford has\\nstill got the upper hand, there\\'s nothing to fear. If otherwise,\\nour enemy will come to find us, and he will not find us\\nunprepared!\" From a drawer in the desk, he took a service\\nrevolver, and placed it in his coat pocket.\\n\"Now we\\'re ready. I know better than even to suggest going\\nwithout you, Miss Tuppence----\"\\n\"I should think so indeed!\"\\n\"But I do suggest that Miss Finn should remain here. She will be\\nperfectly safe, and I am afraid she is absolutely worn out with\\nall she has been through.\"\\nBut to Tuppence\\'s surprise Jane shook her head.\\n\"No. I guess I\\'m going too. Those papers were my trust. I must\\ngo through with this business to the end. I\\'m heaps better now\\nanyway.\"\\nSir James\\'s car was ordered round. During the short drive\\nTuppence\\'s heart beat tumultuously. In spite of momentary qualms\\nof uneasiness respecting Tommy, she could not but feel\\nexultation. They were going to win!\\nThe car drew up at the corner of the square and they got out. Sir\\nJames went up to a plain-clothes man who was on duty with several\\nothers, and spoke to him. Then he rejoined the girls.\\n\"No one has gone into the house so far. It is being watched at\\nthe back as well, so they are quite sure of that. Anyone who\\nattempts to enter after we have done so will be arrested\\nimmediately. Shall we go in?\"\\nA policeman produced a key. They all knew Sir James well. They\\nhad also had orders respecting Tuppence. Only the third member\\nof the party was unknown to them. The three entered the house,\\npulling the door to behind them. Slowly they mounted the rickety\\nstairs. At the top was the ragged curtain hiding the recess where\\nTommy had hidden that day. Tuppence had heard the story from\\nJane in her character of \"Annette.\" She looked at the tattered\\nvelvet with interest. Even now she could almost swear it\\nmoved--as though some one was behind it. So strong was the\\nillusion that she almost fancied she could make out the outline\\nof a form.... Supposing Mr. Brown--Julius--was there waiting....\\nImpossible of course! Yet she almost went back to put the\\ncurtain aside and make sure....\\nNow they were entering the prison room. No place for anyone to\\nhide here, thought Tuppence, with a sigh of relief, then chided\\nherself indignantly. She must not give way to this foolish\\nfancying--this curious insistent feeling that MR. BROWN WAS IN\\nTHE HOUSE.... Hark! what was that? A stealthy footstep on the\\nstairs? There WAS some one in the house! Absurd! She was\\nbecoming hysterical.\\nJane had gone straight to the picture of Marguerite. She\\nunhooked it with a steady hand. The dust lay thick upon it, and\\nfestoons of cobwebs lay between it and the wall. Sir James\\nhanded her a pocket-knife, and she ripped away the brown paper\\nfrom the back.... The advertisement page of a magazine fell out.\\nJane picked it up. Holding apart the frayed inner edges she\\nextracted two thin sheets covered with writing!\\nNo dummy this time! The real thing!\\n\"We\\'ve got it,\" said Tuppence. \"At last....\"\\nThe moment was almost breathless in its emotion. Forgotten the\\nfaint creakings, the imagined noises of a minute ago. None of\\nthem had eyes for anything but what Jane held in her hand.\\nSir James took it, and scrutinized it attentively.\\n\"Yes,\" he said quietly, \"this is the ill-fated draft treaty!\"\\n\"We\\'ve succeeded,\" said Tuppence. There was awe and an almost\\nwondering unbelief in her voice.\\nSir James echoed her words as he folded the paper carefully and\\nput it away in his pocket-book, then he looked curiously round\\nthe dingy room.\\n\"It was here that our young friend was confined for so long, was\\nit not?\" he said. \"A truly sinister room. You notice the\\nabsence of windows, and the thickness of the close-fitting door.\\nWhatever took place here would never be heard by the outside\\nworld.\"\\nTuppence shivered. His words woke a vague alarm in her. What if\\nthere WAS some one concealed in the house? Some one who might bar\\nthat door on them, and leave them to die like rats in a trap?\\nThen she realized the absurdity of her thought. The house was\\nsurrounded by police who, if they failed to reappear, would not\\nhesitate to break in and make a thorough search. She smiled at\\nher own foolishness--then looked up with a start to find Sir\\nJames watching her. He gave her an emphatic little nod.\\n\"Quite right, Miss Tuppence. You scent danger. So do I. So does\\nMiss Finn.\"\\n\"Yes,\" admitted Jane. \"It\\'s absurd--but I can\\'t help it.\"\\nSir James nodded again.\\n\"You feel--as we all feel--THE PRESENCE OF MR. BROWN. Yes\"--as\\nTuppence made a movement--\"not a doubt of it--MR. BROWN IS\\nHERE....\"\\n\"In this house?\"\\n\"In this room.... You don\\'t understand? I AM MR. BROWN....\"\\nStupefied, unbelieving, they stared at him. The very lines of\\nhis face had changed. It was a different man who stood before\\nthem. He smiled a slow cruel smile.\\n\"Neither of you will leave this room alive! You said just now we\\nhad succeeded. I have succeeded! The draft treaty is mine.\" His\\nsmile grew wider as he looked at Tuppence. \"Shall I tell you how\\nit will be? Sooner or later the police will break in, and they\\nwill find three victims of Mr. Brown--three, not two, you\\nunderstand, but fortunately the third will not be dead, only\\nwounded, and will be able to describe the attack with a wealth of\\ndetail! The treaty? It is in the hands of Mr. Brown. So no one\\nwill think of searching the pockets of Sir James Peel Edgerton!\"\\nHe turned to Jane.\\n\"You outwitted me. I make my acknowledgments. But you will not\\ndo it again.\"\\nThere was a faint sound behind him, but, intoxicated with\\nsuccess, he did not turn his head.\\nHe slipped his hand into his pocket.\\n\"Checkmate to the Young Adventurers,\" he said, and slowly raised\\nthe big automatic.\\nBut, even as he did so, he felt himself seized from behind in a\\ngrip of iron. The revolver was wrenched from his hand, and the\\nvoice of Julius Hersheimmer said drawlingly:\\n\"I guess you\\'re caught redhanded with the goods upon you.\"\\nThe blood rushed to the K.C.\\'s face, but his self-control was\\nmarvellous, as he looked from one to the other of his two\\ncaptors. He looked longest at Tommy.\\n\"You,\" he said beneath his breath. \"YOU! I might have known.\"\\nSeeing that he was disposed to offer no resistance, their grip\\nslackened. Quick as a flash his left hand, the hand which bore\\nthe big signet ring, was raised to his lips....\\n\" \\'Ave, Caesar! te morituri salutant,\\' \" he said, still looking\\nat Tommy.\\nThen his face changed, and with a long convulsive shudder he fell\\nforward in a crumpled heap, whilst an odour of bitter almonds\\nfilled the air.\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\nA SUPPER PARTY AT THE SAVOY\\nTHE supper party given by Mr. Julius Hersheimmer to a few friends\\non the evening of the 30th will long be remembered in catering\\ncircles. It took place in a private room, and Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s\\norders were brief and forcible. He gave carte blanche--and when\\na millionaire gives carte blanche he usually gets it!\\nEvery delicacy out of season was duly provided. Waiters carried\\nbottles of ancient and royal vintage with loving care. The floral\\ndecorations defied the seasons, and fruits of the earth as far\\napart as May and November found themselves miraculously side by\\nside. The list of guests was small and select. The American\\nAmbassador, Mr. Carter, who had taken the liberty, he said, of\\nbringing an old friend, Sir William Beresford, with him,\\nArchdeacon Cowley, Dr. Hall, those two youthful adventurers, Miss\\nPrudence Cowley and Mr. Thomas Beresford, and last, but not\\nleast, as guest of honour, Miss Jane Finn.\\nJulius had spared no pains to make Jane\\'s appearance a success. A\\nmysterious knock had brought Tuppence to the door of the\\napartment she was sharing with the American girl. It was Julius.\\nIn his hand he held a cheque.\\n\"Say, Tuppence,\" he began, \"will you do me a good turn? Take\\nthis, and get Jane regularly togged up for this evening. You\\'re\\nall coming to supper with me at the Savoy. See? Spare no\\nexpense. You get me?\"\\n\"Sure thing,\" mimicked Tuppence. \"We shall enjoy ourselves. It\\nwill be a pleasure dressing Jane. She\\'s the loveliest thing I\\'ve\\never seen.\"\\n\"That\\'s so,\" agreed Mr. Hersheimmer fervently.\\nHis fervour brought a momentary twinkle to Tuppence\\'s eye.\\n\"By the way, Julius,\" she remarked demurely, \"I--haven\\'t given\\nyou my answer yet.\"\\n\"Answer?\" said Julius. His face paled.\\n\"You know--when you asked me to--marry you,\" faltered Tuppence,\\nher eyes downcast in the true manner of the early Victorian\\nheroine, \"and wouldn\\'t take no for an answer. I\\'ve thought it\\nwell over----\"\\n\"Yes?\" said Julius. The perspiration stood on his forehead.\\nTuppence relented suddenly.\\n\"You great idiot!\" she said. \"What on earth induced you to do\\nit? I could see at the time you didn\\'t care a twopenny dip for\\nme!\"\\n\"Not at all. I had--and still have--the highest sentiments of\\nesteem and respect--and admiration for you----\"\\n\"H\\'m!\" said Tuppence. \"Those are the kind of sentiments that\\nvery soon go to the wall when the other sentiment comes along!\\nDon\\'t they, old thing?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know what you mean,\" said Julius stiffly, but a large\\nand burning blush overspread his countenance.\\n\"Shucks!\" retorted Tuppence. She laughed, and closed the door,\\nreopening it to add with dignity: \"Morally, I shall always\\nconsider I have been jilted!\"\\n\"What was it?\" asked Jane as Tuppence rejoined her.\\n\"Julius.\"\\n\"What did he want?\"\\n\"Really, I think, he wanted to see you, but I wasn\\'t going to let\\nhim. Not until to-night, when you\\'re going to burst upon every\\none like King Solomon in his glory! Come on! WE\\'RE GOING TO\\nSHOP!\"\\nTo most people the 29th, the much-heralded \"Labour Day,\" had\\npassed much as any other day. Speeches were made in the Park and\\nTrafalgar Square. Straggling processions, singing the Red Flag,\\nwandered through the streets in a more or less aimless manner.\\nNewspapers which had hinted at a general strike, and the\\ninauguration of a reign of terror, were forced to hide their\\ndiminished heads. The bolder and more astute among them sought to\\nprove that peace had been effected by following their counsels.\\nIn the Sunday papers a brief notice of the sudden death of Sir\\nJames Peel Edgerton, the famous K.C., had appeared. Monday\\'s\\npaper dealt appreciatively with the dead man\\'s career. The exact\\nmanner of his sudden death was never made public.\\nTommy had been right in his forecast of the situation. It had\\nbeen a one-man show. Deprived of their chief, the organization\\nfell to pieces. Kramenin had made a precipitate return to Russia,\\nleaving England early on Sunday morning. The gang had fled from\\nAstley Priors in a panic, leaving behind, in their haste, various\\ndamaging documents which compromised them hopelessly. With these\\nproofs of conspiracy in their hands, aided further by a small\\nbrown diary taken from the pocket of the dead man which had\\ncontained a full and damning resume of the whole plot, the\\nGovernment had called an eleventh-hour conference. The Labour\\nleaders were forced to recognize that they had been used as a\\ncat\\'s paw. Certain concessions were made by the Government, and\\nwere eagerly accepted. It was to be Peace, not War!\\nBut the Cabinet knew by how narrow a margin they had escaped\\nutter disaster. And burnt in on Mr. Carter\\'s brain was the\\nstrange scene which had taken place in the house in Soho the\\nnight before.\\nHe had entered the squalid room to find that great man, the\\nfriend of a lifetime, dead--betrayed out of his own mouth. From\\nthe dead man\\'s pocket-book he had retrieved the ill-omened draft\\ntreaty, and then and there, in the presence of the other three,\\nit had been reduced to ashes.... England was saved!\\nAnd now, on the evening of the 30th, in a private room at the\\nSavoy, Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was receiving his guests.\\nMr. Carter was the first to arrive. With him was a\\ncholeric-looking old gentleman, at sight of whom Tommy flushed up\\nto the roots of his hair. He came forward.\\n\"Ha!\" said the old gentleman, surveying him apoplectically. \"So\\nyou\\'re my nephew, are you? Not much to look at--but you\\'ve done\\ngood work, it seems. Your mother must have brought you up well\\nafter all. Shall we let bygones be bygones, eh? You\\'re my heir,\\nyou know; and in future I propose to make you an allowance--and\\nyou can look upon Chalmers Park as your home.\"\\n\"Thank you, sir, it\\'s awfully decent of you.\"\\n\"Where\\'s this young lady I\\'ve been hearing such a lot about?\"\\nTommy introduced Tuppence.\\n\"Ha!\" said Sir William, eyeing her. \"Girls aren\\'t what they used\\nto be in my young days.\"\\n\"Yes, they are,\" said Tuppence. \"Their clothes are different,\\nperhaps, but they themselves are just the same.\"\\n\"Well, perhaps you\\'re right. Minxes then--minxes now!\"\\n\"That\\'s it,\" said Tuppence. \"I\\'m a frightful minx myself.\"\\n\"I believe you,\" said the old gentleman, chuckling, and pinched\\nher ear in high good-humour. Most young women were terrified of\\nthe \"old bear,\" as they termed him. Tuppence\\'s pertness\\ndelighted the old misogynist.\\nThen came the timid archdeacon, a little bewildered by the\\ncompany in which he found himself, glad that his daughter was\\nconsidered to have distinguished herself, but unable to help\\nglancing at her from time to time with nervous apprehension. But\\nTuppence behaved admirably. She forbore to cross her legs, set a\\nguard upon her tongue, and steadfastly refused to smoke.\\nDr. Hall came next, and he was followed by the American\\nAmbassador.\\n\"We might as well sit down,\" said Julius, when he had introduced\\nall his guests to each other. \"Tuppence, will you \"\\nHe indicated the place of honour with a wave of his hand.\\nBut Tuppence shook her head.\\n\"No--that\\'s Jane\\'s place! When one thinks of how she\\'s held out\\nall these years, she ought to be made the queen of the feast\\nto-night.\"\\nJulius flung her a grateful glance, and Jane came forward shyly\\nto the allotted seat. Beautiful as she had seemed before, it was\\nas nothing to the loveliness that now went fully adorned.\\nTuppence had performed her part faithfully. The model gown\\nsupplied by a famous dressmaker had been entitled \"A tiger lily.\"\\nIt was all golds and reds and browns, and out of it rose the pure\\ncolumn of the girl\\'s white throat, and the bronze masses of hair\\nthat crowned her lovely head. There was admiration in every eye,\\nas she took her seat.\\nSoon the supper party was in full swing, and with one accord\\nTommy was called upon for a full and complete explanation.\\n\"You\\'ve been too darned close about the whole business,\" Julius\\naccused him. \"You let on to me that you were off to the\\nArgentine--though I guess you had your reasons for that. The idea\\nof both you and Tuppence casting me for the part of Mr. Brown\\njust tickles me to death!\"\\n\"The idea was not original to them,\" said Mr. Carter gravely. \"It\\nwas suggested, and the poison very carefully instilled, by a\\npast-master in the art. The paragraph in the New York paper\\nsuggested the plan to him, and by means of it he wove a web that\\nnearly enmeshed you fatally.\"\\n\"I never liked him,\" said Julius. \"I felt from the first that\\nthere was something wrong about him, and I always suspected that\\nit was he who silenced Mrs. Vandemeyer so appositely. But it\\nwasn\\'t till I heard that the order for Tommy\\'s execution came\\nright on the heels of our interview with him that Sunday that I\\nbegan to tumble to the fact that he was the big bug himself.\"\\n\"I never suspected it at all,\" lamented Tuppence. \"I\\'ve always\\nthought I was so much cleverer than Tommy--but he\\'s undoubtedly\\nscored over me handsomely.\"\\nJulius agreed.\\n\"Tommy\\'s been the goods this trip! And, instead of sitting there\\nas dumb as a fish, let him banish his blushes, and tell us all\\nabout it.\"\\n\"Hear! hear!\"\\n\"There\\'s nothing to tell,\" said Tommy, acutely uncomfortable. \"I\\nwas an awful mug--right up to the time I found that photograph of\\nAnnette, and realized that she was Jane Finn. Then I remembered\\nhow persistently she had shouted out that word \\'Marguerite\\'--and\\nI thought of the pictures, and--well, that\\'s that. Then of course\\nI went over the whole thing to see where I\\'d made an ass of\\nmyself.\"\\n\"Go on,\" said Mr. Carter, as Tommy showed signs of taking refuge\\nin silence once more.\\n\"That business about Mrs. Vandemeyer had worried me when Julius\\ntold me about it. On the face of it, it seemed that he or Sir\\nJames must have done the trick. But I didn\\'t know which.\\nFinding that photograph in the drawer, after that story of how it\\nhad been got from him by Inspector Brown, made me suspect Julius.\\nThen I remembered that it was Sir James who had discovered the\\nfalse Jane Finn. In the end, I couldn\\'t make up my mind--and\\njust decided to take no chances either way. I left a note for\\nJulius, in case he was Mr. Brown, saying I was off to the\\nArgentine, and I dropped Sir James\\'s letter with the offer of the\\njob by the desk so that he would see it was a genuine stunt.\\nThen I wrote my letter to Mr. Carter and rang up Sir James.\\nTaking him into my confidence would be the best thing either way,\\nso I told him everything except where I believed the papers to be\\nhidden. The way he helped me to get on the track of Tuppence and\\nAnnette almost disarmed me, but not quite. I kept my mind open\\nbetween the two of them. And then I got a bogus note from\\nTuppence--and I knew!\"\\n\"But how?\"\\nTommy took the note in question from his pocket and passed it\\nround the table.\\n\"It\\'s her handwriting all right, but I knew it wasn\\'t from her\\nbecause of the signature. She\\'d never spell her name \\'Twopence,\\'\\nbut anyone who\\'d never seen it written might quite easily do so.\\nJulius HAD seen it--he showed me a note of hers to him once--but\\nSIR JAMES HADN\\'T! After that everything was plain sailing. I sent\\noff Albert post-haste to Mr. Carter. I pretended to go away, but\\ndoubled back again. When Julius came bursting up in his car, I\\nfelt it wasn\\'t part of Mr. Brown\\'s plan--and that there would\\nprobably be trouble. Unless Sir James was actually caught in the\\nact, so to speak, I knew Mr. Carter would never believe it of him\\non my bare word----\"\\n\"I didn\\'t,\" interposed Mr. Carter ruefully.\\n\"That\\'s why I sent the girls off to Sir James. I was sure they\\'d\\nfetch up at the house in Soho sooner or later. I threatened\\nJulius with the revolver, because I wanted Tuppence to repeat\\nthat to Sir James, so that he wouldn\\'t worry about us. The moment\\nthe girls were out of sight I told Julius to drive like hell for\\nLondon, and as we went along I told him the whole story. We got\\nto the Soho house in plenty of time and met Mr. Carter outside.\\nAfter arranging things with him we went in and hid behind the\\ncurtain in the recess. The policemen had orders to say, if they\\nwere asked, that no one had gone into the house. That\\'s all.\"\\nAnd Tommy came to an abrupt halt.\\nThere was silence for a moment.\\n\"By the way,\" said Julius suddenly, \"you\\'re all wrong about that\\nphotograph of Jane. It WAS taken from me, but I found it again.\"\\n\"Where?\" cried Tuppence.\\n\"In that little safe on the wall in Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s bedroom.\"\\n\"I knew you found something,\" said Tuppence reproachfully. \"To\\ntell you the truth, that\\'s what started me off suspecting you.\\nWhy didn\\'t you say?\"\\n\"I guess I was a mite suspicious too. It had been got away from\\nme once, and I determined I wouldn\\'t let on I\\'d got it until a\\nphotographer had made a dozen copies of it!\"\\n\"We all kept back something or other,\" said Tuppence\\nthoughtfully. \"I suppose secret service work makes you like\\nthat!\"\\nIn the pause that ensued, Mr. Carter took from his pocket a small\\nshabby brown book.\\n\"Beresford has just said that I would not have believed Sir James\\nPeel Edgerton to be guilty unless, so to speak, he was caught in\\nthe act. That is so. Indeed, not until I read the entries in\\nthis little book could I bring myself fully to credit the amazing\\ntruth. This book will pass into the possession of Scotland Yard,\\nbut it will never be publicly exhibited. Sir James\\'s long\\nassociation with the law would make it undesirable. But to you,\\nwho know the truth, I propose to read certain passages which will\\nthrow some light on the extraordinary mentality of this great\\nman.\"\\nHe opened the book, and turned the thin pages.\\n\". . . It is madness to keep this book. I know that. It is\\ndocumentary evidence against me. But I have never shrunk from\\ntaking risks. And I feel an urgent need for self-expression....\\nThe book will only be taken from my dead body....\\n\". . . From an early age I realized that I had exceptional\\nabilities. Only a fool underestimates his capabilities. My brain\\npower was greatly above the average. I know that I was born to\\nsucceed. My appearance was the only thing against me. I was\\nquiet and insignificant--utterly nondescript....\\n\". . . When I was a boy I heard a famous murder trial. I was\\ndeeply impressed by the power and eloquence of the counsel for\\nthe defence. For the first time I entertained the idea of taking\\nmy talents to that particular market.... Then I studied the\\ncriminal in the dock.... The man was a fool--he had been\\nincredibly, unbelievably stupid. Even the eloquence of his\\ncounsel was hardly likely to save him. I felt an immeasurable\\ncontempt for him.... Then it occurred to me that the criminal\\nstandard was a low one. It was the wastrels, the failures, the\\ngeneral riff-raff of civilization who drifted into crime....\\nStrange that men of brains had never realized its extraordinary\\nopportunities.... I played with the idea.... What a magnificent\\nfield--what unlimited possibilities! It made my brain reel....\\n\". . . I read standard works on crime and criminals. They all\\nconfirmed my opinion. Degeneracy, disease--never the deliberate\\nembracing of a career by a far-seeing man. Then I considered.\\nSupposing my utmost ambitions were realized--that I was called to\\nthe bar, and rose to the height of my profession? That I entered\\npolitics--say, even, that I became Prime Minister of England?\\nWhat then? Was that power? Hampered at every turn by my\\ncolleagues, fettered by the democratic system of which I should\\nbe the mere figurehead! No--the power I dreamed of was absolute!\\nAn autocrat! A dictator! And such power could only be obtained\\nby working outside the law. To play on the weaknesses of human\\nnature, then on the weaknesses of nations--to get together and\\ncontrol a vast organization, and finally to overthrow the\\nexisting order, and rule! The thought intoxicated me....\\n\". . . I saw that I must lead two lives. A man like myself is\\nbound to attract notice. I must have a successful career which\\nwould mask my true activities.... Also I must cultivate a\\npersonality. I modelled myself upon famous K.C.\\'s. I reproduced\\ntheir mannerisms, their magnetism. If I had chosen to be an\\nactor, I should have been the greatest actor living! No\\ndisguises--no grease paint--no false beards! Personality! I put\\nit on like a glove! When I shed it, I was myself, quiet,\\nunobtrusive, a man like every other man. I called myself Mr.\\nBrown. There are hundreds of men called Brown--there are\\nhundreds of men looking just like me....\\n\". . . I succeeded in my false career. I was bound to succeed. I\\nshall succeed in the other. A man like me cannot fail....\\n\". . . I have been reading a life of Napoleon. He and I have\\nmuch in common....\\n\". . . I make a practice of defending criminals. A man should\\nlook after his own people....\\n\". . . Once or twice I have felt afraid. The first time was in\\nItaly. There was a dinner given. Professor D----, the great\\nalienist, was present. The talk fell on insanity. He said, \\'A\\ngreat many men are mad, and no one knows it. They do not know it\\nthemselves.\\' I do not understand why he looked at me when he\\nsaid that. His glance was strange.... I did not like it....\\n\". . . The war has disturbed me.... I thought it would further my\\nplans. The Germans are so efficient. Their spy system, too, was\\nexcellent. The streets are full of these boys in khaki. All\\nempty-headed young fools.... Yet I do not know.... They won the\\nwar.... It disturbs me....\\n\". . . My plans are going well.... A girl butted in--I do not\\nthink she really knew anything.... But we must give up the\\nEsthonia.... No risks now....\\n\". . . . All goes well. The loss of memory is vexing. It cannot\\nbe a fake. No girl could deceive ME! . . .\\n\". . .The 29th.... That is very soon....\" Mr. Carter paused.\\n\"I will not read the details of the coup that was planned. But\\nthere are just two small entries that refer to the three of you.\\nIn the light of what happened they are interesting.\\n\". . . By inducing the girl to come to me of her own accord, I\\nhave succeeded in disarming her. But she has intuitive flashes\\nthat might be dangerous.... She must be got out of the way.... I\\ncan do nothing with the American. He suspects and dislikes me.\\nBut he cannot know. I fancy my armour is impregnable....\\nSometimes I fear I have underestimated the other boy. He is not\\nclever, but it is hard to blind his eyes to facts....\"\\nMr. Carter shut the book.\\n\"A great man,\" he said. \"Genius, or insanity, who can say?\"\\nThere was silence.\\nThen Mr. Carter rose to his feet.\\n\"I will give you a toast. The Joint Venture which has so amply\\njustified itself by success!\"\\nIt was drunk with acclamation.\\n\"There\\'s something more we want to hear,\" continued Mr. Carter.\\nHe looked at the American Ambassador. \"I speak for you also, I\\nknow. We\\'ll ask Miss Jane Finn to tell us the story that only\\nMiss Tuppence has heard so far--but before we do so we\\'ll drink\\nher health. The health of one of the bravest of America\\'s\\ndaughters, to whom is due the thanks and gratitude of two great\\ncountries!\"\\nCHAPTER XXVIII\\nAND AFTER\\n\"THAT was a mighty good toast, Jane,\" said Mr. Hersheimmer, as he\\nand his cousin were being driven back in the Rolls-Royce to the\\nRitz.\\n\"The one to the joint venture?\"\\n\"No--the one to you. There isn\\'t another girl in the world who\\ncould have carried it through as you did. You were just\\nwonderful!\"\\nJane shook her head.\\n\"I don\\'t feel wonderful. At heart I\\'m just tired and\\nlonesome--and longing for my own country.\"\\n\"That brings me to something I wanted to say. I heard the\\nAmbassador telling you his wife hoped you would come to them at\\nthe Embassy right away. That\\'s good enough, but I\\'ve got another\\nplan. Jane--I want you to marry me! Don\\'t get scared and say no\\nat once. You can\\'t love me right away, of course, that\\'s\\nimpossible. But I\\'ve loved you from the very moment I set eyes\\non your photo--and now I\\'ve seen you I\\'m simply crazy about you!\\nIf you\\'ll only marry me, I won\\'t worry you any--you shall take\\nyour own time. Maybe you\\'ll never come to love me, and if that\\'s\\nthe case I\\'ll manage to set you free. But I want the right to\\nlook after you, and take care of you.\"\\n\"That\\'s what I want,\" said the girl wistfully. \"Some one who\\'ll\\nbe good to me. Oh, you don\\'t know how lonesome I feel!\"\\n\"Sure thing I do. Then I guess that\\'s all fixed up, and I\\'ll see\\nthe archbishop about a special license to-morrow morning.\"\\n\"Oh, Julius!\"\\n\"Well, I don\\'t want to hustle you any, Jane, but there\\'s no sense\\nin waiting about. Don\\'t be scared--I shan\\'t expect you to love\\nme all at once.\"\\nBut a small hand was slipped into his.\\n\"I love you now, Julius,\" said Jane Finn. \"I loved you that\\nfirst moment in the car when the bullet grazed your cheek....\"\\nFive minutes later Jane murmured softly:\\n\"I don\\'t know London very well, Julius, but is it such a very\\nlong way from the Savoy to the Ritz?\"\\n\"It depends how you go,\" explained Julius unblushingly. \"We\\'re\\ngoing by way of Regent\\'s Park!\"\\n\"Oh, Julius--what will the chauffeur think?\"\\n\"At the wages I pay him, he knows better than to do any\\nindependent thinking. Why, Jane, the only reason I had the\\nsupper at the Savoy was so that I could drive you home. I didn\\'t\\nsee how I was ever going to get hold of you alone. You and\\nTuppence have been sticking together like Siamese twins. I guess\\nanother day of it would have driven me and Beresford stark\\nstaring mad!\"\\n\"Oh. Is he----?\"\\n\"Of course he is. Head over ears.\"\\n\"I thought so,\" said Jane thoughtfully.\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"From all the things Tuppence didn\\'t say!\"\\n\"There you have me beat,\" said Mr. Hersheimmer. But Jane only\\nlaughed.\\nIn the meantime, the Young Adventurers were sitting bolt upright,\\nvery stiff and ill at ease, in a taxi which, with a singular lack\\nof originality, was also returning to the Ritz via Regent\\'s Park.\\nA terrible constraint seemed to have settled down between them.\\nWithout quite knowing what had happened, everything seemed\\nchanged. They were tongue-tied--paralysed. All the old\\ncamaraderie was gone.\\nTuppence could think of nothing to say.\\nTommy was equally afflicted.\\nThey sat very straight and forbore to look at each other.\\nAt last Tuppence made a desperate effort.\\n\"Rather fun, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\"Rather.\"\\nAnother silence.\\n\"I like Julius,\" essayed Tuppence again.\\nTommy was suddenly galvanized into life.\\n\"You\\'re not going to marry him, do you hear?\" he said\\ndictatorially. \"I forbid it.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence meekly.\\n\"Absolutely, you understand.\"\\n\"He doesn\\'t want to marry me--he really only asked me out of\\nkindness.\"\\n\"That\\'s not very likely,\" scoffed Tommy.\\n\"It\\'s quite true. He\\'s head over ears in love with Jane. I\\nexpect he\\'s proposing to her now.\"\\n\"She\\'ll do for him very nicely,\" said Tommy condescendingly.\\n\"Don\\'t you think she\\'s the most lovely creature you\\'ve ever\\nseen?\"\\n\"Oh, I dare say.\"\\n\"But I suppose you prefer sterling worth,\" said Tuppence\\ndemurely.\\n\"I--oh, dash it all, Tuppence, you know!\"\\n\"I like your uncle, Tommy,\" said Tuppence, hastily creating a\\ndiversion. \"By the way, what are you going to do, accept Mr.\\nCarter\\'s offer of a Government job, or accept Julius\\'s invitation\\nand take a richly remunerated post in America on his ranch?\"\\n\"I shall stick to the old ship, I think, though it\\'s awfully good\\nof Hersheimmer. But I feel you\\'d be more at home in London.\"\\n\"I don\\'t see where I come in.\"\\n\"I do,\" said Tommy positively.\\nTuppence stole a glance at him sideways.\\n\"There\\'s the money, too,\" she observed thoughtfully.\\n\"What money?\"\\n\"We\\'re going to get a cheque each. Mr. Carter told me so.\"\\n\"Did you ask how much?\" inquired Tommy sarcastically.\\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence triumphantly. \"But I shan\\'t tell you.\"\\n\"Tuppence, you are the limit!\"\\n\"It has been fun, hasn\\'t it, Tommy? I do hope we shall have lots\\nmore adventures.\"\\n\"You\\'re insatiable, Tuppence. I\\'ve had quite enough adventures\\nfor the present.\"\\n\"Well, shopping is almost as good,\" said Tuppence dreamily.\\n\"Think of buying old furniture, and bright carpets, and futurist\\nsilk curtains, and a polished dining-table, and a divan with lots\\nof cushions.\"\\n\"Hold hard,\" said Tommy. \"What\\'s all this for?\"\\n\"Possibly a house--but I think a flat.\"\\n\"Whose flat?\"\\n\"You think I mind saying it, but I don\\'t in the least! OURS, so\\nthere!\"\\n\"You darling!\" cried Tommy, his arms tightly round her. \"I was\\ndetermined to make you say it. I owe you something for the\\nrelentless way you\\'ve squashed me whenever I\\'ve tried to be\\nsentimental.\"\\nTuppence raised her face to his. The taxi proceeded on its\\ncourse round the north side of Regent\\'s Park.\\n\"You haven\\'t really proposed now,\" pointed out Tuppence. \"Not\\nwhat our grandmothers would call a proposal. But after listening\\nto a rotten one like Julius\\'s, I\\'m inclined to let you off.\"\\n\"You won\\'t be able to get out of marrying me, so don\\'t you think\\nit.\"\\n\"What fun it will be,\" responded Tuppence. \"Marriage is called\\nall sorts of things, a haven, and a refuge, and a crowning glory,\\nand a state of bondage, and lots more. But do you know what I\\nthink it is?\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"A sport!\"\\n\"And a damned good sport too,\" said Tommy.\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s Etext of Secret Adversary by Agatha Christie'"

              "'Adventure 1.\\nA Scandal in Bohemia.\\n1.\\nTo Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him\\nmention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\\npredominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin\\nto love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were\\nabhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take\\nit, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has\\nseen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He\\nnever spoke of the softer passions, save with a\\n 3\\ngibe and a sneer.They were admirable things for the observer— excellent\\nfor drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained\\nreasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted\\ntemperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a\\ndoubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack\\nin one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a\\nstrong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to\\nhim, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable\\nmemory.\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from\\neach other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests\\nwhich rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own\\nestablishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes,\\nwho loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained\\nin our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating\\nfrom week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the\\ndrug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever,\\ndeeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties\\nand extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and\\nclearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the\\nofficial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings:\\nof his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing\\nup of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\\nfinally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his\\nactivity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily\\npress, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\\nOne night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a\\njourney to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way\\nled me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which\\nmust always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark\\nincidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see\\nHolmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary\\npowers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his\\ntall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was\\npacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his\\nhands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his\\nattitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had\\nrisen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some\\nnew problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had\\nformerly been in part my own.\\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see\\nme. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an\\narmchair, threw across his case\\n 5\\nof cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he\\nstood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective\\nfashion.\\n“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put on\\nseven and a half pounds since I saw you.”\\n“Seven!” I answered.\\n“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy,\\nWatson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you\\nintended to go into harness.”\\n“Then, how do you know?”\\n“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself\\nvery wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?”\\n“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have been\\nburned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country\\nwalk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed\\nmy clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is\\nincorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see\\nhow you work it out.”\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\\n“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside of your\\nleft shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six\\nalmost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has\\nvery carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove\\ncrusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had\\nbeen out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant bootslitting\\nspecimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman\\nwalks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of\\nsilver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat\\nto show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I\\ndo not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of\\ndeduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked, “the thing\\nalways appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it\\nmyself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled\\nuntil you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good\\nas yours.”\\n“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down\\ninto an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.\\nFor example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the\\nhall to this room.”\\n“Frequently.”\\n“How often?”\\n“Well, some hundreds of times.”\\n“Then how many are there?”\\n“How many? I don’t know.”\\n 7\\n“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my\\npoint. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen\\nand observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these little problems,\\nand since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling\\nexperiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of thick,\\npink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table. “It came\\nby the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\n“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it said, “a\\ngentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest\\nmoment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have\\nshown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of\\nan importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we\\nhave from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and\\ndo not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.”\\n“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it\\nmeans?”\\n“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.\\nInsensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to\\nsuit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?”\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\\n“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\\nendeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not\\nbe bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.”\\n“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English paper\\nat all. Hold it up to the light.”\\nI did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G” with a\\nsmall “t” woven into the texture of the paper.\\n“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\\n“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\\n“Not at all.The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the\\nGerman for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of\\ncourse, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us glance at our\\nContinental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume from his\\nshelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking\\ncountry—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable as being the\\nscene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and\\npaper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?” His eyes\\nsparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\\n“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\\n“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\\npeculiar construction of the sentence—’This\\n 9\\naccount of you we have from all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or\\nRussian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous\\nto his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this\\nGerman who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to\\nshowing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all\\nour doubts.”\\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheels\\nagainst the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.\\n“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of the\\nwindow. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty\\nguineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing\\nelse.”\\n“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”\\n“Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And\\nthis promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”\\n“But your client—”\\n“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit\\ndown in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\\npassage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\\nauthoritative tap.\\n“Come in!” said Holmes.\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in\\nheight, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a\\nrichness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste.\\nHeavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his\\ndouble-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his\\nshoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a\\nbrooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended\\nhalfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown\\nfur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by\\nhis whole appearance. He carried a broadbrimmed hat in his hand, while he\\nwore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones,\\na black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,\\nfor his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the\\nface he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\\nand a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of\\nobstinacy.\\n“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\\nmarked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from one\\nto the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\n“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr.\\nWatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\\nhave I the honour to address?”\\n 11\\n“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\\nunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\\ndiscretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance.\\nIf not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.”\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\\nmy chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this gentleman\\nanything which you may say to me.”\\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he, “by\\nbinding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time\\nthe matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that\\nit is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.”\\n“I promise,” said Holmes.\\n“And I.”\\n“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor.\\n“The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to\\nyou, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called\\nmyself is not exactly my own.”\\n“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.\\n“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be\\ntaken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously\\ncompromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the\\nmatter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of\\nBohemia.”\\n“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his\\narmchair and closing his eyes.\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging\\nfigure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most\\nincisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly\\nreopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\\n“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I\\nshould be better able to advise you.”\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\\nuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the\\nmask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,” he cried;\\n“I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?”\\n“Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken before I\\nwas aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of CasselFelstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.”\\n“But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once more\\nand passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can understand that\\nI am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the\\nmatter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting\\nmyself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of\\nconsulting you.”\\n“Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\n 13\\n“The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to\\nWarsaw, I made the acquaintance of the wellknown adventuress, Irene\\nAdler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.”\\n“Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes without\\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all\\nparagraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a\\nsubject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In\\nthis case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew\\nrabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the\\ndeep-sea fishes.\\n“Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.\\nContralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—\\nyes! Retired from operatic stage— ha! Living in London—quite so! Your\\nMajesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote\\nher some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters\\nback.”\\n“Precisely so. But how—”\\n“Was there a secret marriage?”\\n“None.”\\n“No legal papers or certificates?”\\n“None.”\\n“Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person\\nshould produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\\nprove their authenticity?”\\n“There is the writing.”\\n“Pooh, pooh! Forgery.”\\n“My private note-paper.”\\n“Stolen.”\\n“My own seal.”\\n“Imitated.”\\n“My photograph.”\\n“Bought.”\\n“We were both in the photograph.”\\n“Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\\nindiscretion.”\\n“I was mad—insane.”\\n“You have compromised yourself seriously.”\\n“I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty\\nnow.”\\n“It must be recovered.”\\n“We have tried and failed.”\\n“Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.”\\n“She will not sell.”\\n“Stolen, then.”\\n“Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay\\nransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled.\\nTwice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.”\\n“No sign of it?”\\n 15\\n“Absolutely none.”\\nHolmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he.\\n“But a very serious one to me,” returned the King reproachfully.\\n“Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?”\\n“To ruin me.”\\n“But how?”\\n“I am about to be married.”\\n“So I have heard.”\\n“To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\\nScandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is\\nherself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct\\nwould bring the matter to an end.”\\n“And Irene Adler?”\\n“Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she\\nwill do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face\\nof the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men.\\nRather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which\\nshe would not go—none.”\\n“You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”\\n“I am sure.”\\n“And why?”\\n“Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal\\nwas publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.”\\n“Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmes with a yawn. “That is very\\nfortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at\\npresent. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?”\\n“Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count\\nVon Kramm.”\\n“Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.”\\n“Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.”\\n“Then, as to money?”\\n“You have carte blanche.”\\n“Absolutely?”\\n“I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have\\nthat photograph.”\\n“And for present expenses?”\\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it\\non the table.\\n“There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he\\nsaid.\\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to\\nhim.\\n“And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked.\\n“Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.”\\n 17\\nHolmes took a note of it. “One other question,” said he. “Was the\\nphotograph a cabinet?”\\n“It was.”\\n“Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some\\ngood news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheels of\\nthe royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be good enough to\\ncall to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like to chat this little\\nmatter over with you.”\\n2.\\nAt three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet\\nreturned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after\\neight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the\\nintention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply\\ninterested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim\\nand strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I\\nhave already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of\\nhis client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made\\nit a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick,\\nsubtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries.\\nSo accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his\\nfailing had ceased to enter into my head.\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\\ngroom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\\ndisreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my\\nfriend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times\\nbefore I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the\\nbedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable,\\nas of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in\\nfront of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.\\n“Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was\\nobliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\\n“What is it?”\\n“It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my\\nmorning, or what I ended by doing.”\\n“I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and\\nperhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.”\\n“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left\\nthe house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the character of a\\ngroom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among\\nhorsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I\\nsoon\\n 19\\nfound Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built\\nout in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large\\nsitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to\\nthe floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child\\ncould open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage\\nwindow could be reached from the top of the coachhouse. I walked round it\\nand examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting\\nanything else of interest.\\n“I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a\\nmews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers\\na hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a\\nglass of half and half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as\\nI could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people\\nin the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose\\nbiographies I was compelled to listen to.”\\n“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.\\n“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the\\ndaintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews,\\nto a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day,\\nand returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except\\nwhen she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is\\ndark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often\\ntwice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages\\nof a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from\\nSerpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they\\nhad to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and\\nto think over my plan of campaign.\\n“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He\\nwas a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them,\\nand what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or\\nhis mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to\\nhis keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question\\ndepended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my\\nattention to the gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point,\\nand it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\\ndetails, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to\\nunderstand the situation.”\\n“I am following you closely,” I answered.\\n“I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to\\nBriony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome\\nman, dark, aquiline, and moustached— evidently the man of whom I had\\nheard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait,\\nand brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who\\nwas thoroughly at home.\\n 21\\n“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him\\nin the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly,\\nand waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged,\\nlooking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he\\npulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, ‘Drive like\\nthe devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross & Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then\\nto the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do\\nit in twenty minutes!’\\n“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to\\nfollow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with\\nhis coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of\\nhis harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t pulled up before she\\nshot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the\\nmoment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\\n“‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if you\\nreach it in twenty minutes.’\\n“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I\\nshould run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab\\ncame through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I\\njumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St. Monica,’ said I, ‘and\\nhalf a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ It was twentyfive\\nminutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\\n“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others were\\nthere before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in\\nfront of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church.\\nThere was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a\\nsurpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were\\nall three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle\\nlike any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my\\nsurprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came\\nrunning as hard as he could towards me.\\n“‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come! Come!’\\n“‘What then?’ I asked.\\n“‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’\\n“I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found\\nmyself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching\\nfor things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure\\ntying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all\\ndone in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side\\nand the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It\\nwas the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life,\\nand it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that\\nthere had been\\n 23\\nsome informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused\\nto marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky\\nappearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in\\nsearch of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it\\non my watchchain in memory of the occasion.”\\n“This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and what then?”\\n“Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair\\nmight take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and\\nenergetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they\\nseparated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I shall\\ndrive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said as she left him. I heard no\\nmore. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my\\nown arrangements.”\\n“Which are?”\\n“Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell. “I have\\nbeen too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this\\nevening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.”\\n“I shall be delighted.”\\n“You don’t mind breaking the law?”\\n“Not in the least.”\\n“Nor running a chance of arrest?”\\n“Not in a good cause.”\\n“Oh, the cause is excellent!”\\n“Then I am your man.”\\n“I was sure that I might rely on you.”\\n“But what is it you wish?”\\n“When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.\\nNow,” he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had\\nprovided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is\\nnearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss\\nIrene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at\\nBriony Lodge to meet her.”\\n“And what then?”\\n“You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There\\nis only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what\\nmay. You understand?”\\n“I am to be neutral?”\\n“To do nothing whatever.There will probably be some small\\nunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the\\nhouse. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open.\\nYou are to station yourself close to that open window.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give\\nyou to throw, and will, at the same time, raise\\n 25\\nthe cry of fire. You quite follow me?”\\n“Entirely.”\\n“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar- shaped roll\\nfrom his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke- rocket, fitted with a\\ncap at either end to make it selflighting. Your task is confined to that. When\\nyou raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people.\\nYou may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten\\nminutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?”\\n“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the\\nsignal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at\\nthe corner of the street.”\\n“Precisely.”\\n“Then you may entirely rely on me.”\\n“That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I\\nprepare for the new role I have to play.”\\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the\\ncharacter of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His\\nbroad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and\\ngeneral look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John\\nHare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his\\ncostume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with\\nevery fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science\\nlost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.\\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten\\nminutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was\\nalready dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and\\ndown in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The\\nhouse was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’ succinct\\ndescription, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On\\nthe contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably\\nanimated.There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing\\nin a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were\\nflirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were\\nlounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.\\n“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house,\\n“this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a doubleedged\\nweapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being\\nseen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his\\nprincess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?”\\n“Where, indeed?”\\n“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too\\nlarge for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows that the King\\nis capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort\\nhave already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it\\nabout\\n 27\\nwith her.”\\n“Where, then?”\\n“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility.\\nBut I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they\\nlike to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?\\nShe could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or\\npolitical influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides,\\nremember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be\\nwhere she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.”\\n“But it has twice been burgled.”\\n“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\\n“But how will you look?”\\n“I will not look.”\\n“What then?”\\n“I will get her to show me.”\\n“But she will refuse.”\\n“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It\\nis her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”\\nAs he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the curve\\nof the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of\\nBriony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed\\nforward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed\\naway by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A\\nfierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who\\ntook sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was\\nequally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the\\nlady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of\\nflushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their\\nfists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just\\nas he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood\\nrunning freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels\\nin one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of betterdressed\\npeople, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\\ncrowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as\\nI will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her\\nsuperb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the\\nstreet.\\n“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked. “He is dead,” cried several\\nvoices.\\n“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be\\ngone before you can get him to hospital.”\\n“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had\\nthe lady’s purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were\\na gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.” “He can’t lie in the\\nstreet. May we bring him in, marm?” “Surely. Bring him into the sittingroom.\\nThere is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!”\\n 29\\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\\nprincipal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the\\nwindow. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that\\nI could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was\\nseized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I\\nknow that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than\\nwhen I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the\\ngrace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet\\nit would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the\\npart which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the\\nsmokerocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring\\nher. We are but preventing her from injuring another.\\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is\\nin need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the\\nsame instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket\\ninto the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out of my\\nmouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill—\\ngentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids—joined in a general shriek of “Fire!”\\nThick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open\\nwindow. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice\\nof Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping\\nthrough the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and\\nin ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm in mine, and to get\\naway from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some\\nfew minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead\\ntowards the Edgeware Road.\\n“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been\\nbetter. It is all right.”\\n“You have the photograph?”\\n“I know where it is.”\\n“And how did you find out?”\\n“She showed me, as I told you she would.”\\n“I am still in the dark.”\\n“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was\\nperfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an\\naccomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\\n“I guessed as much.”\\n“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of\\nmy hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and\\nbecame a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\\n“That also I could fathom.”\\n“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\\nshe do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\\nsuspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see\\nwhich. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to\\n 31\\nopen the window, and you had your chance.”\\n“How did that help you?”\\n“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house\\nis on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most.\\nIt is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\\nadvantage of it. In the case of the Darlington substitution scandal it was of\\nuse to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman\\ngrabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was\\nclear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious\\nto her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm\\nof fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake\\nnerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess\\nbehind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an\\ninstant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she halfdrew it out. When I cried out\\nthat it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from\\nthe room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses,\\nescaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the\\nphotograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching\\nme narrowly it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin\\nall.”\\n“And now?” I asked.\\n“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and\\nwith you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sittingroom\\nto wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may\\nfind neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty\\nto regain it with his own hands.”\\n“And when will you call?”\\n“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear\\nfield. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete\\nchange in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.”\\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching\\nhis pockets for the key when someone passing said:\\n“Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.”\\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\\nappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\\n“I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit\\nstreet. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.”\\n3.\\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and\\ncoffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\\n“You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes\\n 33\\nby either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face. “Not yet.”\\n“But you have hopes?”\\n“I have hopes.”\\n“Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.” “We must have a cab.”\\n“No, my brougham is waiting.”\\n“Then that will simplify matters.” We descended and started\\noff once more for Briony Lodge.\\n“Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes.\\n“Married! When?”\\n“Yesterday.”\\n“But to whom?”\\n“To an English lawyer named Norton.”\\n“But she could not love him.”\\n“I am in hopes that she does.”\\n“And why in hopes?”\\n“Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the\\nlady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love\\nyour Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your\\nMajesty’s plan.”\\n“It is true. And yet—Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a\\nqueen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence, which was\\nnot broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the\\nsteps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\\nbrougham.\\n“Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she.\\n“I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a\\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\\n“Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this\\nmorning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the\\nContinent.”\\n“What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise.\\n“Do you mean that she has left England?”\\n“Never to return.”\\n“And the papers?” asked the King hoarsely. “All is lost.”\\n“We shall see.” He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawingroom,\\nfollowed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about\\nin every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady\\nhad hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bellpull,\\ntore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out\\na photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in\\nevening dress, the letter was superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be\\nleft till called for.” My friend tore it open and we all three read it together. It\\nwas dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\\n“MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well.\\nYou took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a\\nsuspicion. But then, when I found\\n 35\\nhow I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you\\nmonths ago. I had been told that if the King employed an agent it would\\ncertainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this,\\nyou made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\\nsuspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman.\\nBut, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is\\nnothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I\\nsent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walkingclothes,\\nas I call them, and came down just as you departed.\\n“Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an\\nobject of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather\\nimprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my\\nhusband.\\n“We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so\\nformidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call tomorrow.\\nAs to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am\\nloved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without\\nhindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to\\nsafeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me\\nfrom any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph\\nwhich he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\n“Very truly yours,\\n“IRENE NORTON, née ADLER.\\n“What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia, when\\nwe had all three read this epistle. “Did I not tell you how quick and resolute\\nshe was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that\\nshe was not on my level?”\\n“From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very\\ndifferent level to your Majesty,” said Holmes coldly. “I am sorry that I have\\nnot been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more successful\\nconclusion.”\\n“On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King; “nothing could be more\\nsuccessful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe\\nas if it were in the fire.”\\n“I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.”\\n“I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward\\nyou. This ring—” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and\\nheld it out upon the palm of his hand.\\n“Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,” said\\nHolmes.\\n“You have but to name it.”\\n“This photograph!”\\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\\n“Irene’s photograph!” he cried. “Certainly, if you wish it.”\\n“I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I\\nhave the honour to wish you a very good-morning.” He bowed, and, turning\\naway without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him,\\nhe set off in my\\n 37\\ncompany for his chambers.\\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of\\nBohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a\\nwoman’s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I\\nhave not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or\\nwhen he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of\\nthe woman.\\nAdventure 2.\\nThe Red-headed League.\\nI had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn\\nof last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, floridfaced,\\nelderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my\\nintrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into\\nthe room and closed the door behind me.\\n“You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,” he\\nsaid cordially.\\n“I was afraid that you were engaged.”\\n“So I am. Very much so.”\\n“Then I can wait in the next room.”\\n“Not at all.This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in\\nmany of my most successful cases, and I have\\n 39\\nno doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.”\\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting,\\nwith a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.\\n“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his\\nfingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “I know, my\\ndear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the\\nconventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your\\nrelish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if\\nyou will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own\\nlittle adventures.”\\n“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,”\\nI observed.\\n“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just be\\nfore we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss\\nMary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary\\ncombinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more\\ndaring than any effort of the imagination.”\\n“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.” “You did, Doctor, but\\nnone the less you must come round\\nto my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact\\non you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to\\nbe right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been\\ngood enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a\\nnarrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have\\nlistened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and\\nmost unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the\\nsmaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt\\nwhether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard it is\\nimpossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or\\nnot, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have\\never listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to\\nrecommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr.\\nWatson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature\\nof the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.\\nAs a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events,\\nI am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which\\noccur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to\\nadmit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.” The portly client\\npuffed out his chest with an appearance\\nof some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper\\nfrom the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down\\nthe advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and\\nthe paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at\\nthe man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion,\\nto read the indications which might be presented by his dress\\nor appearance.\\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our\\n 41\\nvisitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British\\ntradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey\\nshepherd’s check trousers, a not over-clean black frockcoat, unbuttoned in\\nthe front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a\\nsquare pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat\\nand a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair\\nbeside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable\\nabout the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme\\nchagrin and discontent upon his features.\\nSherlock Holmes’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head\\nwith a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the obvious\\nfacts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that\\nhe is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a\\nconsiderable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”\\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper,\\nbut his eyes upon my companion.\\n“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?” he\\nasked. “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It’s as\\ntrue as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”\\n“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your\\nleft. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.”\\n“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”\\n“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially\\nas, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass\\nbreastpin.”\\n“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”\\n“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches,\\nand the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it\\nupon the desk?”\\n“Well, but China?”\\n“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could\\nonly have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks\\nand have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of\\nstaining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China.\\nWhen, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the\\nmatter becomes even more simple.”\\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he. “I thought at\\nfirst that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in\\nit, after all.”\\n“I begin to think, Watson,” said Holmes, “that I make a mistake in\\nexplaining. ‘Omne ignotum pro magnifico,’ you know, and my poor little\\nreputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not\\nfind the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?”\\n“Yes, I have got it now,” he answered with his thick red finger planted\\nhalfway down the column. “Here it is. This is what began it all. You just\\nread it for yourself, sir.”\\n 43\\nI took the paper from him and read as follows: “TO THE RED-HEADED\\nLEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of\\nLebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which\\nentitles a member of the League to a salary of 4 pounds a week for purely\\nnominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and\\nabove the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on\\nMonday, at eleven o’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7\\nPope’s Court, Fleet Street.”\\n“What on earth does this mean?” I ejaculated after I had twice read over the\\nextraordinary announcement.\\nHolmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high\\nspirits. “It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?” said he. “And now, Mr.\\nWilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household,\\nand the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will\\nfirst make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date.”\\n“It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.”\\n“Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?”\\n“Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said\\nJabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; “I have a small pawnbroker’s business\\nat Coburg Square, near the City. It’s not a very large affair, and of late years\\nit has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two\\nassistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but\\nthat he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business.”\\n“What is the name of this obliging youth?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n“His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either. It’s hard\\nto say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I\\nknow very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able\\nto give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his\\nhead?”\\n“Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employé who comes\\nunder the full market price. It is not a common experience among\\nemployers in this age. I don’t know that your assistant is not as remarkable\\nas your advertisement.”\\n“Oh, he has his faults, too,” said Mr. Wilson. “Never was such a fellow for\\nphotography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving\\nhis mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to\\ndevelop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he’s a good\\nworker. There’s no vice in him.”\\n“He is still with you, I presume?”\\n“Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and\\nkeeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a widower\\nand never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we\\nkeep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.\\n 45\\n“The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came\\ndown into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his\\nhand, and he says:\\n“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’\\n“‘Why that?’ I asks.\\n“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed\\nMen. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I\\nunderstand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the\\ntrustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money. If my hair would\\nonly change colour, here’s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.’\\n“‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-athome\\nman, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it,\\nI was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that\\nway I didn’t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always\\nglad of a bit of news.\\n“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked\\nwith his eyes open.\\n“‘Never.’\\n“‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the\\nvacancies.’\\n“‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.\\n“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need\\nnot interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’\\n“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the\\nbusiness has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of\\nhundred would have been very handy.\\n“‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.\\n“‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for yourself\\nthat the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should\\napply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by\\nan American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his\\nways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all redheaded\\nmen; so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous\\nfortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the\\nproviding of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear\\nit is splendid pay and very little to do.’\\n“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would\\napply.’\\n“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘You see it is really\\nconfined to Londoners, and to grown men.This American had started from\\nLondon when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.\\nThen, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red,\\nor dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared\\nto apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly\\nbe worth your while to put yourself out of\\n 47\\nthe way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’\\n“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves,\\nthat my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to\\nme that if there was to be any competition in the matter I\\nstood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent\\nSpaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he\\nmight prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters\\nfor the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a\\nholiday, so we shut the business up and started\\noff for the address that was given us in the advertisement. “I never hope to\\nsee such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes.\\nFrom north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade\\nof red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.\\nFleet Street was choked with red-headed folk,\\nand Pope’s Court looked like a coster’s orange barrow. I should\\nnot have thought there were so many in the whole country as\\nwere brought together by that single advertisement. Every\\nshade of colour they were—straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irishsetter, liver,\\nclay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many\\nwho had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how\\nmany were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but\\nSpaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not\\nimagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me\\nthrough the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the\\noffice. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going\\nup in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in\\nas well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.” “Your\\nexperience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes as his\\nclient paused and refreshed his memory\\nwith a huge pinch of snuff. “Pray continue your very interesting statement.”\\n“There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden\\nchairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a\\nhead that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to\\neach candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to\\nfind some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting\\na vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all.\\nHowever, when our turn came the little man was much more\\nfavourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the\\ndoor as we entered, so that he might have a private word with\\nus.\\n“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is\\nwilling to fill a vacancy in the League.’\\n“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He\\nhas every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.’\\nHe took a step backward, cocked his head on\\none side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then\\nsuddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me\\nwarmly on my success.\\n“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am sure,\\nexcuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’\\nWith that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged\\n 49\\nuntil I yelled with the pain. ‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he as he\\nreleased me. ‘I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful,\\nfor we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you\\ntales of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He\\nstepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice\\nthat the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from\\nbelow, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was\\nnot a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\\n“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the\\npensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married\\nman, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’\\n“I answered that I had not.\\n“His face fell immediately.\\n“‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I\\nam sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation\\nand spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is\\nexceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’\\n“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to\\nhave the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he\\nsaid that it would be all right.\\n“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but we must\\nstretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When\\nshall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’\\n“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I.\\n“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding. ‘I should\\nbe able to look after that for you.’\\n“‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.\\n“‘Ten to two.’\\n“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes,\\nespecially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it\\nwould suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew\\nthat my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that\\nturned up.\\n“‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’\\n“‘Is 4 pounds a week.’\\n“‘And the work?’\\n“‘Is purely nominal.’\\n“‘What do you call purely nominal?’\\n“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole\\ntime. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very\\nclear upon that point. You don’t comply with the conditions if you budge\\nfrom the office during that time.’\\n“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said I.\\n“‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross; ‘neither sickness nor\\nbusiness nor anything else. There you must stay, or\\n 51\\nyou lose your billet.’\\n“‘And the work?’\\n“‘Is to copy out the “Encyclopaedia Britannica.” There is\\nthe first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and\\nblotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready tomorrow?’\\n“‘Certainly,’ I answered.\\n“‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once\\nmore on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to\\ngain.’ He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant,\\nhardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good\\nfortune.\\n“Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits\\nagain; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some\\ngreat hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It\\nseemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that\\nthey would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the\\n‘Encyclopaedia Britannica.’ Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer\\nme up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing.\\nHowever, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I\\nbought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of\\nfoolscap paper, I started off for Pope’s Court.\\n“Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.The\\ntable was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I\\ngot fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me;\\nbut he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At\\ntwo o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I\\nhad written, and locked the door of the office after me.\\n“This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager\\ncame in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work. It\\nwas the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was\\nthere at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross\\ntook to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not\\ncome in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an\\ninstant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a\\ngood one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.\\n“Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and\\nArchery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence\\nthat I might get on to the B’s before very long. It cost me something in\\nfoolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then\\nsuddenly the whole business came to an end.”\\n“To an end?”\\n“Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten\\no’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard\\nhammered on to the middle\\n 53\\nof the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself.”\\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of notepaper.\\nIt read in this fashion:\\nTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS\\nDISSOLVED.\\nOctober 9, 1890.\\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face\\nbehind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped\\nevery other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.\\n“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client, flushing up\\nto the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothing better than laugh at\\nme, I can go elsewhere.”\\n“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had\\nhalf risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. It is most\\nrefreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so,\\nsomething just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when\\nyou found the card upon the door?”\\n“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices\\nround, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went\\nto the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and I asked\\nhim if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He\\nsaid that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr.\\nDuncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.\\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’\\n“‘What, the red-headed man?’\\n“‘Yes.’\\n“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a\\nsolicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new\\npremises were ready. He moved out yesterday.’ “‘Where could I find him?’\\n“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward\\nStreet, near St. Paul’s.’\\n“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a\\nmanufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either\\nMr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”\\n“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.\\n“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant.\\nBut he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I\\nshould hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did\\nnot wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you\\nwere good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I\\ncame right away to you.”\\n“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an exceedingly\\nremarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have\\ntold me I think that it is possible that\\n 55\\ngraver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.” “Grave\\nenough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost\\nfour pound a week.”\\n“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes,\\n“I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league.\\nOn the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer\\nby some 30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge\\nwhich you have gained on every subject which comes under\\nthe letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”\\n“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they\\nare, and what their object was in playing this prank—if it was\\na prank—upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for\\nit cost them two and thirty pounds.”\\n“We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And,\\nfirst, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours\\nwho first called your attention to the advertisement—how long\\nhad he been with you?”\\n“About a month then.”\\n“How did he come?”\\n“In answer to an advertisement.”\\n“Was he the only applicant?”\\n“No, I had a dozen.”\\n“Why did you pick him?”\\n“Because he was handy and would come cheap.” “At half-wages, in fact.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”\\n“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his\\nface, though he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid\\nupon his forehead.”\\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I\\nthought as much,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his\\nears are pierced for earrings?”\\n“Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when\\nhe was a lad.”\\n“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is\\nstill with you?”\\n“Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.”\\n“And has your business been attended to in your absence?” “Nothing to\\ncomplain of, sir. There’s never very much to do\\nof a morning.”\\n“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an\\nopinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day\\nis Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a\\nconclusion.”\\n“Well, Watson,” said Holmes when our visitor had left us,\\n“what do you make of it all?”\\n“I make nothing of it,” I answered frankly. “It is a most\\nmysterious business.”\\n“As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the\\nless mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes\\nwhich are really puzzling, just as a common\\n 57\\nplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this\\nmatter.”\\n“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.\\n“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that\\nyou won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up in his chair,\\nwith his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his\\neyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some\\nstrange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and\\nindeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with\\nthe gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon\\nthe mantelpiece.\\n“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked. “What\\ndo you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?”\\n“I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.”\\n“Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we\\ncan have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of\\nGerman music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than\\nItalian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!”\\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk\\ntook us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we\\nhad listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place,\\nwhere four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small\\nrailed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded\\nlaurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial\\natmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with “JABEZ WILSON” in\\nwhite letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our redheaded\\nclient carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it\\nwith his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining\\nbrightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and\\nthen down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he\\nreturned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the\\npavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and\\nknocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young\\nfellow, who asked him to step in.\\n“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go\\nfrom here to the Strand.”\\n“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\\n“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He is, in my\\njudgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure\\nthat he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.”\\n“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in this\\nmystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way\\nmerely in order that you might see him.”\\n 59\\n“Not him.”\\n“What then?”\\n“The knees of his trousers.”\\n“And what did you see?”\\n“What I expected to see.”\\n“Why did you beat the pavement?”\\n“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk.\\nWe are spies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg\\nSquare. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”\\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from\\nthe retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the\\nfront of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which\\nconveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was\\nblocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide\\ninward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying\\nswarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of\\nfine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the\\nother side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\\n“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the\\nline, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a\\nhobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer’s,\\nthe tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City\\nand Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane’s\\ncarriagebuilding depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now,\\nDoctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had some play. A sandwich\\nand a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and\\ndelicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with\\ntheir conundrums.”\\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very\\ncapable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he\\nsat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his\\nlong, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his\\nlanguid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuthhound,\\nHolmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was\\npossible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately\\nasserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I\\nhave often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood\\nwhich occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him\\nfrom extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was\\nnever so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in\\nhis armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it\\nwas that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his\\nbrilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those\\nwho were unacquainted with his meth\\n 61\\nods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that\\nof other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music\\nat St. James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those\\nwhom he had set himself to hunt down.\\n“You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,” he remarked as we emerged.\\n“Yes, it would be as well.”\\n“And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business\\nat Coburg Square is serious.”\\n“Why serious?”\\n“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe\\nthat we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather\\ncomplicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”\\n“At what time?”\\n“Ten will be early enough.”\\n“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”\\n“Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly\\nput your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand, turned on his\\nheel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always\\noppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock\\nHolmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen,\\nand yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had\\nhappened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business\\nwas still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in\\nKensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the redheaded\\ncopier of the “Encyclopaedia” down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg\\nSquare, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What\\nwas this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we\\ngoing, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this\\nsmooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man— a man who\\nmight play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and\\nset the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.\\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way\\nacross the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms\\nwere standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of\\nvoices from above. On entering his room I found Holmes in animated\\nconversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the\\nofficial police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sadfaced man, with a\\nvery shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\\n“Ha! Our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and\\ntaking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I think you know Mr.\\nJones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is\\nto be our com\\n 63\\npanion in to-night’s adventure.”\\n“We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,” said Jones\\nin his consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man\\nfor starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to\\ndo the running down.”\\n“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our\\nchase,” observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\\n“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes,\\nsir,” said the police agent loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are,\\nif he won’t mind my saying so, just a little too\\ntheoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective\\nin him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that\\nbusiness of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has\\nbeen more nearly correct than the official force.”\\n“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger\\nwith deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the\\nfirst Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have\\nnot had my rubber.”\\n“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you\\nwill play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done\\nyet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr.\\nMerryweather, the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for\\nyou, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your\\nhands.”\\n“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a\\nyoung man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I\\nwould rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London.\\nHe’s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal\\nduke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning\\nas his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never\\nknow where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one\\nweek, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.\\nI’ve been on his track for years\\nand have never set eyes on him yet.”\\n“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you tonight. I’ve had\\none or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay,\\nand I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It\\nis past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two\\nwill take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the\\nsecond.”\\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the\\nlong drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which\\nhe had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless\\nlabyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington\\nStreet.\\n“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather\\nis a bank director, and personally interested\\nin the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also.\\nHe is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He\\nhas one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog\\nand as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone.\\n 65\\nHere we are, and they are waiting for us.”\\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\\nourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the\\nguidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and\\nthrough a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small\\ncorridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened,\\nand led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another\\nformidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then\\nconducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a\\nthird door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates\\nand massive boxes.\\n“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked as he held up\\nthe lantern and gazed about him.\\n“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags\\nwhich lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he remarked,\\nlooking up in surprise.\\n“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes severely. “You\\nhave already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg\\nthat you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and\\nnot to interfere?”\\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\\ninjured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the\\nfloor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine\\nminutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy\\nhim, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\\n“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they can hardly take\\nany steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose\\na minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have\\nfor their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no doubt you have divined\\n—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr.\\nMerryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that\\nthere are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a\\nconsiderable interest in this cellar at present.”\\n“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several\\nwarnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\\n“Your French gold?”\\n“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\\nborrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has\\nbecome known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and\\nthat it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000\\nnapoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is\\nmuch larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the\\ndirectors have had misgivings upon the subject.”\\n“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time\\nthat we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will\\ncome to a head. In the meantime\\n 67\\nMr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.”\\n“And sit in the dark?”\\n“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought\\nthat, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your rubber after all. But I\\nsee that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the\\npresence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These\\nare daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may\\ndo us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and\\ndo you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon\\nthem, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about\\nshooting them down.”\\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\\nwhich I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and\\nleft us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never before\\nexperienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was\\nstill there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To me, with my nerves\\nworked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and\\nsubduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\\n“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through the\\nhouse into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked\\nyou, Jones?”\\n“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”\\n“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.”\\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour\\nand a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone\\nand the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I\\nfeared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest\\npitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the\\ngentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper,\\nheavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank\\ndirector. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the\\nfloor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened\\nout until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a\\ngash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand,\\nwhich felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more\\nthe hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was\\nwithdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the\\nsingle lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing\\nsound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a\\nsquare, gaping hole, through which\\n 69\\nstreamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,\\nboyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either\\nside of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one\\nknee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole\\nand was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a\\npale face and a shock of very red hair.\\n“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags? Great\\nScott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”\\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The\\nother dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones\\nclutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but\\nHolmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and the pistol clinked\\nupon the stone floor.\\n“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You have no chance at all.”\\n“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that my\\npal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”\\n“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.\\n“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must\\ncompliment you.”\\n“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and\\neffective.”\\n“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at climbing\\ndown holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”\\n“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our\\nprisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not be aware\\nthat I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you\\naddress me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”\\n“All right,” said Jones with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you please,\\nsir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the\\npolice-station?”\\n“That is better,” said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the\\nthree of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\\n“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from\\nthe cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There\\nis no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete\\nmanner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever\\ncome within my experience.”\\n“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John\\nClay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this matter,\\nwhich I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid\\nby having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing\\nthe very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”\\n 71\\n“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat\\nover a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was perfectly obvious\\nfrom the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of\\nthe advertisement of the League, and the copying of the ‘Encyclopaedia,’\\nmust be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number\\nof hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would\\nbe difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to\\nClay’s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice’s hair. The 4 pounds\\na week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were\\nplaying for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the\\ntemporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and\\ntogether they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week.\\nFrom the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it\\nwas obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the\\nsituation.”\\n“But how could you guess what the motive was?” “Had there been women\\nin the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however,\\nwas out of the question. The man’s business was a small one, and there was\\nnothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations,\\nand such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of\\nthe house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for\\nphotography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There\\nwas the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious\\nassistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most\\ndaring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar—\\nsomething which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it\\nbe, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to\\nsome other building.\\n“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you\\nby beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the\\ncellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the\\nbell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some\\nskirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly\\nlooked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself\\nhave remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of\\nthose hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were\\nburrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank\\nabutted on our friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem.\\nWhen you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and\\nupon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”\\n“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” I\\nasked.\\n“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a\\n 73\\nsign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other\\nwords, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they\\nshould use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be\\nremoved. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would\\ngive them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them\\nto come to-night.”\\n“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. “It\\nis so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”\\n“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I already feel it\\nclosing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the\\ncommonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.”\\n“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,”\\nhe remarked. “‘L’homme c’est rien—l’oeuvre c’est tout,’ as Gustave\\nFlaubert wrote to George Sand.”\\nAdventure 3.\\nA Case of Identity.\\n“My dear fellow,” said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire\\nin his lodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely stranger than anything\\nwhich the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the\\nthings which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly\\nout of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove\\nthe roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange\\ncoincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of\\nevents, working through generations, and leading to the most outré results,\\nit would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions\\nmost stale and unprofitable.”\\n“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The cases\\n 75\\nwhich come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar\\nenough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits,\\nand yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.”\\n“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic\\neffect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police report, where more\\nstress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the\\ndetails, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter.\\nDepend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.”\\nI smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand your thinking so.” I\\nsaid. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to\\neverybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are\\nbrought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here”—I picked\\nup the morning paper from the ground—”let us put it to a practical test.\\nHere is the first heading upon which I come. ‘A husband’s cruelty to his\\nwife.’ There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is\\nall perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink,\\nthe push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The\\ncrudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.”\\n“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,” said\\nHolmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This is the Dundas\\nseparation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small\\npoints in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no\\nother woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into\\nthe habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling\\nthem at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to\\nthe imagination of the average storyteller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor,\\nand acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.”\\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of\\nthe lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple\\nlife that I could not help commenting upon it.\\n“Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little\\nsouvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case\\nof the Irene Adler papers.”\\n“And the ring?” I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled\\nupon his finger.\\n“It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I\\nserved them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who\\nhave been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.”\\n“And have you any on hand just now?” I asked with interest.\\n“Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They\\nare important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have\\nfound that it is usually in unimpor\\n 77\\ntant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick\\nanalysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The\\nlarger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more\\nobvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate\\nmatter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing\\nwhich presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may\\nhave something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of\\nmy clients, or I am much mistaken.”\\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds\\ngazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his\\nshoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman\\nwith a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a\\nbroadbrimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire\\nfashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a\\nnervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated\\nbackward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons.\\nSuddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she\\nhurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\\n“I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his cigarette\\ninto the fire. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de\\ncoeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too\\ndelicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When\\na woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and\\nthe usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a\\nlove matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or\\ngrieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.”\\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to\\nannounce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his\\nsmall black figure like a fullsailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat.\\nSherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was\\nremarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he\\nlooked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar\\nto him.\\n“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little trying to\\ndo so much typewriting?”\\n“I did at first,” she answered, “but now I know where the letters are without\\nlooking.” Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a\\nviolent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad,\\ngood-humoured face. “You’ve heard about me, Mr. Holmes,” she cried,\\n“else how could you know all that?”\\n“Never mind,” said Holmes, laughing; “it is my business to know things.\\nPerhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why\\nshould you come to consult me?”\\n“I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose\\nhusband you found so easy when the police\\n 79\\nand everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you\\nwould do as much for me. I’m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in\\nmy own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would\\ngive it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\n“Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked Sherlock\\nHolmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary\\nSutherland. “Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said, “for it made me\\nangry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank—that is, my father—\\ntook it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and\\nso at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm\\ndone, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to\\nyou.”\\n“Your father,” said Holmes, “your stepfather, surely, since the name is\\ndifferent.”\\n“Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is\\nonly five years and two months older than myself.”\\n“And your mother is alive?”\\n“Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when\\nshe married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was nearly\\nfifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham\\nCourt Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried\\non with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made\\nher sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.\\nThey got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn’t near as\\nmuch as father could have got if he had been alive.”\\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and\\ninconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the\\ngreatest concentration of attention.\\n“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”\\n“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in\\nAuckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per cent. Two thousand\\nfive hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.”\\n“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw so large a\\nsum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt\\ntravel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady\\ncan get on very nicely upon an income of about 60 pounds.”\\n“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that\\nas long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and so they\\nhave the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that\\nis only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and\\n 81\\npays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn\\nat typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from\\nfifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”\\n“You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes. “This is my\\nfriend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself.\\nKindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at the\\nfringe of her jacket. “I met him first at the gasfitters’ ball,” she said. “They\\nused to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they\\nremembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to\\ngo. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I\\nwanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on\\ngoing, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk\\nwere not fit for us to know, when all father’s friends were to be there. And\\nhe said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had\\nnever so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would\\ndo, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went,\\nmother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there\\nI met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\n“I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back from\\nFrance he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”\\n“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and\\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a\\nwoman, for she would have her way.”\\n“I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman\\ncalled Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\n“Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got\\nhome all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met\\nhim twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer\\nAngel could not come to the house any more.”\\n“No?”\\n“Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort. He wouldn’t have\\nany visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be\\nhappy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a\\nwoman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.”\\n“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?”\\n“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote\\nand said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had\\ngone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I\\ntook the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.”\\n“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”\\n“Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took.\\nHosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office\\n 83\\nin Leadenhall Street—and—”\\n“What office?”\\n“That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t know.” “Where did he live,\\nthen?”\\n“He slept on the premises.”\\n“And you don’t know his address?”\\n“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”\\n“Where did you address your letters, then?”\\n“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called\\nfor. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all\\nthe other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite\\nthem, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said that when I\\nwrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten\\nhe always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show\\nyou how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would\\nthink of.”\\n“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an axiom of mine\\nthat the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember\\nany other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\\n“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the\\nevening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous.\\nVery retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He’d had\\nthe quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had\\nleft him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech.\\nHe was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak,\\njust as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.”\\n“Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned\\nto France?”\\n“Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should\\nmarry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me\\nswear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would\\nalways be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear,\\nand that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the\\nfirst and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of\\nmarrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said\\nnever to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said\\nshe would make it all right with him. I didn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It\\nseemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older\\nthan me; but I didn’t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at\\nBordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came\\nback to me on the very morning of the wedding.”\\n“It missed him, then?”\\n“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”\\n“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged,\\n 85\\nthen, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?”\\n“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near\\nKing’s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the\\nSt. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as\\nthere were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself\\ninto a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab\\nin the street. We got to the church first, and when the fourwheeler drove up\\nwe waited for him to step out, but he never\\ndid, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked\\nthere was no one there! The cabman said that he could not\\nimagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in\\nwith his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I\\nhave never seen or heard anything since then to throw any\\nlight upon what became of him.”\\n“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,”\\nsaid Holmes.\\n“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so.\\nWhy, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to\\nbe true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us,\\nI was always to remember\\nthat I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge\\nsooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning,\\nbut what has happened since gives a meaning to it.” “Most certainly it does.\\nYour own opinion is, then, that some\\nunforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?”\\n“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have\\ntalked so. And then I think that what he fore\\nsaw happened.”\\n“But you have no notion as to what it could have been?” “None.”\\n“One more question. How did your mother take the matter?”\\n“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the\\nmatter again.”\\n“And your father? Did you tell him?”\\n“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had\\nhappened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said,\\nwhat interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors\\nof the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed\\nmy money, or if he had married me and got my money settled\\non him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very\\nindependent about money and never would look at a shilling\\nof mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could\\nhe not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I\\ncan’t sleep a wink at night.” She pulled a little handkerchief\\nout of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.\\n“I shall glance into the case for you,” said Holmes, rising,\\n“and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result.\\nLet the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let\\nyour mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr.\\nHosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from\\nyour life.”\\n 87\\n“Then you don’t think I’ll see him again?”\\n“I fear not.”\\n“Then what has happened to him?”\\n“You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an\\naccurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.”\\n“I advertised for him in last Saturday’s Chronicle,” said she. “Here is the\\nslip and here are four letters from him.”\\n“Thank you. And your address?”\\n“No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.”\\n“Mr. Angel’s address you never had, I understand. Where is your father’s\\nplace of business?”\\n“He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of\\nFenchurch Street.”\\n“Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the\\npapers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the\\nwhole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.”\\n“You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to\\nHosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.”\\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something\\nnoble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She\\nlaid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a\\npromise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed\\ntogether, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward\\nto the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe,\\nwhich was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his\\nchair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look\\nof infinite languor in his face.\\n“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I found her more\\ninteresting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one.\\nYou will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in ’77, and\\nthere was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea,\\nhowever, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the\\nmaiden herself was most instructive.”\\n“You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to\\nme,” I remarked.\\n“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and\\nso you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the\\nimportance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues\\nthat may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that\\nwoman’s appearance? Describe it.”\\n“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of\\na brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a\\nfringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than\\ncoffee colour,\\n 89\\nwith a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish\\nand were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn’t observe.\\nShe had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly\\nwell-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”\\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\\n“‘Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have\\nreally done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of\\nimportance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for\\ncolour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself\\nupon details. My first glance is always at a woman’s sleeve. In a man it is\\nperhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this\\nwoman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for\\nshowing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the\\ntypewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined.The sewingmachine,\\nof the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm,\\nand on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across\\nthe broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the\\ndint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short\\nsight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.”\\n“It surprised me.”\\n“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on\\nglancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing\\nwere not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a\\nslightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only\\nin the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and\\nfifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has\\ncome away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great\\ndeduction to say that she came away in a hurry.”\\n“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my\\nfriend’s incisive reasoning.\\n“I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but\\nafter being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the\\nforefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were\\nstained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too\\ndeep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear\\nupon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go\\nback to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised\\ndescription of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\\nI held the little printed slip to the light.\\n“Missing,” it said, “on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named\\nHosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow\\ncomplexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black sidewhiskers\\nand moustache;\\n 91\\ntinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in\\nblack frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and\\ngrey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots.\\nKnown to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody\\nbringing—”\\n“That will do,” said Holmes. “As to the letters,” he continued, glancing\\nover them, “they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr.\\nAngel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point,\\nhowever, which will no doubt strike you.”\\n“They are typewritten,” I remarked.\\n“Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little\\n‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no\\nsuperscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point\\nabout the signature is very suggestive —in fact, we may call it conclusive.”\\n“Of what?”\\n“My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the\\ncase?”\\n“I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his\\nsignature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.”\\n“No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should\\nsettle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady’s\\nstepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six\\no’clock tomorrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with\\nthe male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to\\nthose letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the\\ninterim.”\\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of\\nreasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have\\nsome solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he\\ntreated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once\\nonly had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the\\nIrene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the\\nSign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study\\nin Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not\\nunravel. I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the\\nconviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he\\nheld in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the\\ndisappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the\\ntime, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It\\nwas not until close upon six o’clock that I found myself free and was able to\\nspring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be\\ntoo late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock\\nHolmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form\\n 93\\ncurled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and\\ntest-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that\\nhe had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\\n“Well, have you solved it?” I asked as I entered. “Yes. It was the bisulphate\\nof baryta.”\\n“No, no, the mystery!” I cried.\\n“Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working\\nupon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said\\nyesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that\\nthere is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.”\\n“Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?”\\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened\\nhis lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at\\nthe door.\\n“This is the girl’s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “He has\\nwritten to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!”\\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years\\nof age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner,\\nand a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a\\nquestioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the\\nsideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\\n“Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “I think that this\\ntypewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me\\nfor six o’clock?”\\n“Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own\\nmaster, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about\\nthis little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in\\npublic. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very\\nexcitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily\\ncontrolled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not\\nmind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it\\nis not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides,\\nit is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer\\nAngel?”\\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes quietly; “I have every reason to believe that\\nI will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. “I am delighted\\nto hear it,” he said.\\n“It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a typewriter has really quite\\nas much individuality as a man’s handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no\\ntwo of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others,\\nand some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr.\\nWindibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over\\n 95\\nof the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the ‘r.’ There are fourteen other\\ncharacteristics, but those are the more obvious.”\\n“We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt\\nit is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his\\nbright little eyes.\\n“And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.\\nWindibank,” Holmes continued. “I think of writing another little\\nmonograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It\\nis a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four\\nletters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all\\ntypewritten. In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and the ‘r’s’ tailless,\\nbut you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the\\nfourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.”\\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. “I cannot\\nwaste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,” he said. “If you can\\ncatch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.”\\n“Certainly,” said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. “I\\nlet you know, then, that I have caught him!”\\n“What! where?” shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and\\nglancing about him like a rat in a trap.\\n“Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,” said Holmes suavely. “There is no\\npossible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it\\nwas a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to\\nsolve so simple a question. That’s right! Sit down and let us talk it over.”\\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of\\nmoisture on his brow. “It—it’s not actionable,” he stammered.\\n“I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it\\nwas as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came\\nbefore me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will\\ncontradict me if I go wrong.”\\nThe man sat huddled up in h is chair, with his head sunk upon his breast,\\nlike one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of\\nthe mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began\\ntalking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\\n“The man married a woman very much older tha n himself for her money,”\\nsaid he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she\\nlived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and\\nthe loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to\\npreserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but\\naffectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with\\nher fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be\\nallowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course,\\nthe loss of a hundred a\\n97\\nyear, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious\\ncourse of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of\\npeople of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer\\nforever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced\\nher positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever\\nstepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to\\nhis heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised\\nhimself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a\\nmoustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an\\ninsinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short sight,\\nhe appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love\\nhimself.”\\n“It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “We never thought that she\\nwould have been so carried away.”\\n“Very likely not. However that ma y be, the young lady was very decidedly\\ncarried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in\\nFrance, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind.\\nShe was flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was\\nincreased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr.\\nAngel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as\\nfar as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings,\\nand an engagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from\\nturning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up\\nforever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The\\nthing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic\\nmanner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady’s\\nmind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to\\ncome. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence\\nalso the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very\\nmorning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so\\nbound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to\\ncome, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church\\ndoor he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently\\nvanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler\\nand out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!”\\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes h ad\\nbeen talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale\\nface.\\n“It m ay be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but if you are so very\\nsharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking\\nthe law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but\\nas long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for\\nassault and illegal constraint.”\\n“The law cannot, as you say, to uch you,” said Holmes,\\n99\\nunlocking and throwing open the door, “yet there never was a man who\\ndeserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he\\nought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing\\nup at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not part of my\\nduties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just\\ntreat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could\\ngrasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door\\nbanged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running\\nat the top of his speed down the road.\\n“There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said Holmes, laughing, as he threw\\nhimself down into his chair once more. “That fellow will rise from crime to\\ncrime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case\\nhas, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”\\n“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” I remarked.\\n“Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer A ngel\\nmust have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally\\nclear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we\\ncould see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never\\ntogether, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was\\nsuggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both\\nhinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all\\nconfirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of\\ncourse, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would\\nrecognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts,\\ntogether with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.”\\n“And how did you verify them?”\\n“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the\\nfirm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I\\neliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise—the\\nwhiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that\\nthey would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their\\ntravellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I\\nwrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would\\ncome here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same\\ntrivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from\\nWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description\\ntallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank. Voilà\\ntout!”\\n“And Miss Sutherland?”\\n“If I tell her she will no t believe me. You may remember the old Persian\\nsaying, ‘There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also\\nfor whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ There is as much sense in\\nHafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.”\\nAdventure 4.\\nThe Boscombe Valley Mystery.\\nWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid\\nbrought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:\\n“Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the\\nwest of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad\\nif you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the\\n11:15.”\\n“What do you say, dear?” said my wife, looking across at me. “Will you\\ngo?”\\n“I rea lly don’t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.”\\n“Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been lookin g a little\\npale lately. I think that the change would\\n101 do you good, and you are al ways so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes’\\ncases.”\\n“I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of\\nthem,” I answered. “But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only\\nhalf an hour.”\\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of\\nmaking me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so\\nthat in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away\\nto Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the\\nplatform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey\\ntravelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\\n“It is really very good of you to come, Watson,” said he. “It makes a\\nconsiderable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can\\nthoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you\\nwill keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.”\\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which\\nHolmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with\\nintervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading.\\nThen he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up\\nonto the rack.\\n“Have you heard anything of the case?” he asked. “Not a word. I have not\\nseen a paper for some days.” “The London press has not had very full\\naccounts. I have\\n103\\njust been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the\\nparticulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases\\nwhich are so extremely difficult.”\\n“That sounds a little paradoxical.”\\n“But it is profoundly true. Singula rity is almost invariably a clue. The more\\nfeatureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it\\nhome. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case\\nagainst the son of the murdered man.”\\n“It is a murder, then?”\\n“Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have\\nthe opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of\\nthings to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few\\nwords.\\n“Bosco mbe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\\nHerefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John\\nTurner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to\\nthe old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let\\nto Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian.The men had\\nknown each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when\\nthey came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible.\\nTurner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but\\nstill remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were\\nfrequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner\\nhad an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living.\\nThey appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English\\nfamilies and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond\\nof sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the\\nneighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a man and a girl. Turner had\\na considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I\\nhave been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.\\n“On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his hous e at Hatherley\\nabout three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which\\nis a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down\\nthe Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning\\nat Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an\\nappointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he\\nnever came back alive.\\n“From Hatherley Farm -house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,\\nand two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old\\nwoman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder,\\na game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose\\nthat Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a\\nfew minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr.\\nJames McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best\\nof his belief, the father was\\n105\\nactually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no\\nmore of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had\\noccurred.\\n“The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the\\ngame-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded\\nround, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of\\nfourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the\\nBoscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She\\nstates that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close\\nby the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having\\na violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong\\nlanguage to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike\\nhis father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and\\ntold her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys\\nquarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were\\ngoing to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy\\ncame running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the\\nwood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited,\\nwithout either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were\\nobserved to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the\\ndead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been\\nbeaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries\\nwere such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his\\nson’s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the\\nbody. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and\\na verdict of ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday,\\nhe was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have\\nreferred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as\\nthey came out before the coroner and the police-court.”\\n“I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked. “If ever\\ncircumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.”\\n“Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered Holmes\\nthoughtfully. “It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you\\nshift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally\\nuncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be\\nconfessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the\\nyoung man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are\\nseveral people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss\\nTurner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his\\ninnocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in\\nconnection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest.\\nLestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is\\nthat two middleaged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour\\ninstead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.”\\n107\\n“I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious that you will find little\\ncredit to be gained out of this case.”\\n“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he answered,\\nlaughing. “Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts\\nwhich may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me\\ntoo well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or\\ndestroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or\\neven of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly\\nperceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and\\nyet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident\\na thing as that.”\\n“How on earth— ”\\n“My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which\\ncharacterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave\\nby the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get\\nfarther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get\\nround the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less\\nilluminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking\\nat himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only\\nquote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my\\nmétier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the\\ninvestigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which\\nwere brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.” “What\\nare they?”\\n“It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to\\nHatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he\\nwas a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it\\nwas no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect\\nof removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of\\nthe coroner’s jury.”\\n“It was a confession ,” I ejaculated.\\n“No, for it was followed by a prote station of innocence.”\\n“Coming on the top of such a damning series of event s, it was at least a\\nmost suspicious remark.”\\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes,“it is the brightest rift which I can at present\\nsee in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an\\nabsolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black\\nagainst him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned\\nindignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because\\nsuch surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and\\nyet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank\\nacceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a\\nman of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his\\ndeserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the\\ndead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day\\nso far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with\\n109\\nhim, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to\\nraise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are\\ndisplayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind\\nrather than of a guilty one.”\\nI shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,” I\\nremarked.\\n“So they h ave. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”\\n“What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”\\n“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his support ers, though there are\\none or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may\\nread it for yourself.”\\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and\\nhaving turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the\\nunfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I\\nsettled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully.\\nIt ran in this way:\\n“Mr. James McC arthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and\\ngave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at\\nBristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the\\n3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was\\ninformed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the\\ngroom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard,\\nand, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of\\nthe yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then\\ntook my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with\\nthe intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On\\nmy way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his\\nevidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I\\nhad no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from\\nthe pool I heard a cry of “Cooee!” which was a usual signal between my\\nfather and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the\\npool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather\\nroughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high\\nwords and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent\\ntemper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and\\nreturned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,\\nhowever, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run\\nback again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head\\nterribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost\\ninstantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my\\nway to Mr. Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for\\nassistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea\\nhow he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat\\ncold and forbidding in his man\\n111 ners, but he had, as far as I kn ow, no active enemies. I know nothing further\\nof the matter.’\\n“The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\\n“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to\\na rat.\\n“The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\\n“Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thoug ht that he was delirious.\\n“The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had t his\\nfinal quarrel?\\n“Witness: I sh ould prefer not to answer.\\n“The Coroner: I am afraid that I must pr ess it.\\n“Witness: It is really impossible for me to tel l you. I can assure you that it\\nhas nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\\n“The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you\\nthat your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any\\nfuture proceedings which may arise.\\n“Witness: I must still refuse.\\n“The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was a common signal\\nbetween you and your father?\\n“Witness: It was.\\n“The Coroner: H ow was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and\\nbefore he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\\n“Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know . “A Juryman: Did\\nyou see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on\\nhearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\\n“Witness: Nothing definite.\\n“The Coroner: What do you mean?\\n“Witness: I was so disturbed and ex cited as I rushed out into the open, that I\\ncould think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression\\nthat as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It\\nseemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid\\nperhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.\\n“‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’\\n“‘Yes, it was gone.’\\n“‘You cannot say w hat it was?’\\n“‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’\\n“‘How far from the body?’\\n“‘A dozen yards or so.’\\n“‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’\\n“‘About the same.’\\n“‘Then if it was rem oved it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?’\\n“‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’\\n“This concluded the examination of the witness.”\\n“I see,” said I as I glanced down the column, “tha t the coro\\n113\\nner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He\\ncalls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having\\nsignalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his\\nconversation with his father, and his singular account of his father’s dying\\nwords. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.”\\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the\\ncushioned seat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,” said\\nhe, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s favour. Don’t\\nyou see that you alternately give him credit for having too much\\nimagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of\\nquarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he\\nevolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying\\nreference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall\\napproach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is\\ntrue, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is\\nmy pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we\\nare on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be\\nthere in twenty minutes.”\\nIt was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the\\nbeautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found\\nourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man,\\nfurtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the\\nlight brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his\\nrustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland\\nYard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already\\nbeen engaged for us.\\n“I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. “I\\nknew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had\\nbeen on the scene of the crime.”\\n“It was very nice and complimentary of you,” Holmes answered. “It is\\nentirely a question of barometric pressure.”\\nLestrade looked startled. “I do not quite foll ow,” he said.\\n“How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky.\\nI have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very\\nmuch superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it\\nis probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.”\\nLestrade laughed indulgently. “You have, no d oubt, already formed your\\nconclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “The case is as plain as a\\npikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of\\ncourse, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has\\nheard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her\\nthat there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done.\\nWhy, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”\\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most\\nlovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes\\nshining, her lips parted, a pink flush\\n115 upon her cheeks, all thought o f her natural reserve lost in her overpowering\\nexcitement and concern.\\n“Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the other of us,\\nand finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion,\\n“I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know\\nthat James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work\\nknowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known\\neach other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else\\ndoes; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to\\nanyone who really knows him.”\\n“I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock\\nHolmes. “You may rely upon my doing all that I can.” “But you have read\\nthe evidence. You have formed some\\nconclusion? Do you not see some loo phole, some flaw? Do\\nyou not yourself think that he is innocent?”\\n“I think that it is very probable.”\\n“There, now!” she cried, throwi ng back her head and looking defiantly at\\nLestrade. “You hear! He gives me hopes.” Lestrade shrugged his shoulders.\\n“I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his\\nconclusions,” he\\nsaid.\\n“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never\\ndid it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure tha t the\\nreason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was\\nbecause I was concerned in it.”\\n“In what way?” asked Holmes.\\n“It is no time for me to hide any thing. James and his father\\nhad many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very\\nanxious that there should be a marriage between us. James a nd\\nI have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of\\ncourse he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and—\\nand—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that\\nyet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of\\nthem.”\\n“And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favour of such\\na union?”\\n“No, he w as averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy\\nwas in favour of it.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young\\nface as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at\\nher.\\n“Th ank you for this information,” said he. “May I see your\\nfather if I call to-morrow?”\\n“I am afraid the doctor won ’t allow it.”\\n“The doctor?”\\n“Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong\\nfor years back, but this has broken him down completely. He\\nhas taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck\\nand that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was\\nthe only man alive who had known dad in the old days in\\nVictoria.”\\n117\\n“Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”\\n“Yes, at the mines.”\\n“Quite so; at the gol d-mines, where, as I understand, Mr.\\nTurner made his money.”\\n“Yes, certainly.”\\n“Thank you, Mis s Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.”\\n“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to\\nthe prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know\\nhim to be innocent.”\\n“I will, Miss Turner.”\\n“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him.\\nGood-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.” She hurried from the\\nroom as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her\\ncarriage rattle off down the street.\\n“I am ashamed of you, Holmes, ” said Lestrade with dignity after a few\\nminutes’ silence. “Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to\\ndisappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.”\\n“I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy, ” said Holmes.\\n“Have you an order to see him in prison?”\\n“Yes, but only for you and me.”\\n“Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time\\nto take a train to Hereford and see him tonight?”\\n“Ample.”\\n“Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall\\nonly be away a couple of hours.”\\nI walked down to the station w ith them, and then wandered through the\\nstreets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the\\nsofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of\\nthe story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through\\nwhich we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually\\nfrom the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave\\nmyself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing\\nthat this unhappy young man’s story were absolutely true, then what hellish\\nthing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have\\noccurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment\\nwhen, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was\\nsomething terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the\\ninjuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called\\nfor the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the\\ninquest. In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of\\nthe left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been\\nshattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my\\nown head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That\\nwas to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he\\n119\\nwas face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the\\nolder man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be\\nworth while to call Holmes’ attention to it. Then there was the peculiar\\ndying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A\\nman dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it\\nwas more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what\\ncould it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation.\\nAnd then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that\\nwere true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress,\\npresumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to\\nreturn and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his\\nback turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and\\nimprobabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s opinion,\\nand yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that I could not\\nlose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of\\nyoung McCarthy’s innocence.\\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for\\nLestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\\n“The glass still keeps very high,” he remar ked as he sat down. “It is of\\nimportance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground.\\nOn the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such\\nnice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey.\\nI have seen young McCarthy.”\\n“And what did you learn from him?”\\n“Nothing.”\\n“Could he t hrow no light?”\\n“None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done\\nit and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as\\npuzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though\\ncomely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.”\\n“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is inde ed a fact that he was\\naverse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.”\\n“Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in\\nlove with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before\\nhe really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school,\\nwhat does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and\\nmarry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you\\ncan imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing\\nwhat he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely\\nimpossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands\\nup into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to\\npropose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting\\nhimself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would\\nhave thrown him over utterly\\n121\\nhad he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the\\nlast three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark\\nthat point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the\\nbarmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to\\nbe hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that\\nshe has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really\\nno tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young\\nMcCarthy for all that he has suffered.”\\n“But if he is innocent, who has done it?”\\n“Ah! who? I would call your attention v ery particularly to two points. One\\nis that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and\\nthat the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he\\ndid not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man\\nwas heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had returned. Those\\nare the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk\\nabout George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters\\nuntil to-morrow.”\\nThere was no rai n, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright\\nand cloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and\\nwe set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\\n“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observe d. “It is said that Mr.\\nTurner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”\\n“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.\\n“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and\\nhe has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very\\nbad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s, and, I may add, a\\ngreat benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm\\nrent free.”\\n“Indeed! T hat is interesting,” said Holmes.\\n“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he ha s helped him. Everybody about\\nhere speaks of his kindness to him.”\\n“Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who\\nappears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such\\nobligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner’s\\ndaughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very\\ncocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else\\nwould follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself\\nwas averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce\\nsomething from that?”\\n“We have got to the de ductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade, winking\\nat me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away\\nafter theories and fancies.”\\n“You are right,” said Holm es demurely; “you do find it very hard to tackle\\nthe facts.”\\n“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it\\n123\\ndifficult to get hold of,” replied Lestrade with some warmth. “And that is\\n—”\\n“Th at McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all\\ntheories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”\\n“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes, laughing. “But\\nI am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.”\\n“Yes, that is it.” It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, twostoried,\\nslate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey\\nwalls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a\\nstricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We\\ncalled at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’ request, showed us the boots\\nwhich her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son’s,\\nthough not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very\\ncarefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to\\nthe court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to\\nBoscombe Pool.\\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as\\nthis. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker\\nStreet would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened.\\nHis brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out\\nfrom beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his\\nshoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like\\nwhipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a\\npurely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely\\nconcentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell\\nunheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient\\nsnarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which\\nran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe\\nPool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were\\nmarks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which\\nbounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes\\nstop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade\\nand I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while\\nI watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that\\nevery one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.\\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty\\nyards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and\\nthe private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it\\nupon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked\\nthe site of the rich landowner’s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool\\nthe woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass\\ntwenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined\\nthe lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been\\nfound, and, indeed, so\\n125\\nmoist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left\\nby the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face\\nand peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled\\ngrass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned\\nupon my companion.\\n“What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\\n“I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other\\ntrace. But how on earth—”\\n“Oh, tut, tut! I have no tim e! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is\\nall over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the\\nreeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they\\ncame like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party\\nwith the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or\\neight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same\\nfeet.” He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better\\nview, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. “These are young\\nMcCarthy’s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the\\nsoles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his\\nstory. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the\\nfather’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end\\nof the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here?\\nTiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they\\ncome again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come\\nfrom?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track\\nuntil we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a\\ngreat beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to\\nthe farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little\\ncry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the\\nleaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an\\nenvelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark\\nof the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the\\nmoss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a\\npathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces\\nwere lost.\\n“It has be en a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning to his\\nnatural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge.\\nI think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a\\nlittle note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may\\nwalk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”\\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into\\nRoss, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in\\nthe wood.\\n“This may interest you, Lestrade,” he remarked, holding it out. “The murder\\nwas done with it.”\\n“I see no marks.”\\n127\\n“There are none.”\\n“How do you kno w, then?”\\n“The grass was growing un der it. It had only lain there a\\nfew days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It\\ncorresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.”\\n“And the murderer?”\\n“Is a tall man, left- handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled\\nshooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder,\\nand carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other\\nindications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.”\\nLestrade laughed. “I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,” he s aid. “Theories\\nare all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.”\\n“Nous verrons,” answered Holmes calmly. “You work your own me thod,\\nand I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably\\nreturn to London by the evening train.”\\n“And leave your case unfinished?”\\n“No, finished.”\\n“But the myster y?”\\n“It is solved.”\\n“Who was the criminal, then?”\\n“The gentleman I describe.”\\n“But who is he?”\\n“Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous\\nneighbourhood.”\\nLestrade shrugge d his shoulders. “I am a practical man,” he said, “and I\\nreally cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed\\ngentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland\\nYard.”\\n“All ri ght,” said Holmes quietly. “I have given you the chance. Here are\\nyour lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.”\\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, wher e we found\\nlunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained\\nexpression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.\\n“Look here, Watson,” he said when the cloth was cleared “just sit down in\\nthis chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don’t know quite what to\\ndo, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expound.”\\n“Pray do so.”\\n“Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young\\nMcCarthy’s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they\\nimpressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his\\nfather should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing him.\\nThe other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several\\nwords, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s ear. Now from\\nthis double point our research must commence,\\n129\\nand we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.”\\n“What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?”\\n“Well, obviously it could not h ave been meant for the son. The son, as far as\\nhe knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The\\n‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had\\nthe appointment with. But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly Australian cry, and one\\nwhich is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the\\nperson whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was\\nsomeone who had been in Australia.”\\n“What of the rat, then?”\\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on\\nthe table. “This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,” he said. “I wired to\\nBristol for it last night.” He put his hand over part of the map. “What do\\nyou read?”\\n“ARAT,” I read.\\n“And now?” He raised his hand.\\n“BALLARAT.”\\n“Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only\\ncaught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his\\nmurderer. So and so, of Ballarat.”\\n“It is wonderful!” I exclaimed.\\n“It is obvious. And now, y ou see, I had narrowed the field down\\nconsiderably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which,\\ngranting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come\\nnow out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from\\nBallarat with a grey cloak.”\\n“Certainly.”\\n“And one w ho was at home in the district, for the pool can only be\\napproached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly\\nwander.”\\n“Quite so .”\\n“Then com es our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I\\ngained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the\\npersonality of the criminal.”\\n“But how did you gain them ?”\\n“You know my method. It is fo unded upon the observation of trifles.”\\n“His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his\\nstride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.”\\n“Yes, they were peculiar boots.”\\n“But his lameness?”\\n“The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He\\nput less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped—he was lame.”\\n“But his left-handedness.”\\n“You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the\\nsurgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and\\nyet was upon the left side. Now,\\n131\\nhow can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind\\nthat tree during the interview between the father and son. He had even\\nsmoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of\\ntobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you\\nknow, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the\\nashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having\\nfound the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the\\nmoss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are\\nrolled in Rotterdam.”\\n“And the cigar-holder?”\\n“I could see that the en d had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a\\nholder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean\\none, so I deduced a blunt penknife.”\\n“Holmes,” I said, “you have drawn a net round this man from which he\\ncannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you\\nhad cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all this\\npoints. The culprit is—”\\n“Mr. John Turner,” cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sittingroom,\\nand ushering in a visitor.\\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow,\\nlimping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and\\nyet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed\\nthat he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His\\ntangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined\\nto give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an\\nashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a\\nshade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some\\ndeadly and chronic disease.\\n“Pray sit down on the sofa,” said Holmes gently. “You had my note?”\\n“Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to s ee me\\nhere to avoid scandal.”\\n“I thought people woul d talk if I went to the Hall.” “And why did you wish\\nto see me?” He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary\\neyes, as though his question was already answered.\\n“Yes,” said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. “It is so. I\\nknow all about McCarthy.”\\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. “God help me!” he cried. “But I\\nwould not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I\\nwould have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.”\\n“I am glad to hear you say so,” said Holmes gravely. “I woul d have spoken\\nnow had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart—it will break\\nher heart when she hears that I am arrested.”\\n133\\n“It may not come to that,” said Holmes.\\n“What?”\\n“I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required\\nmy presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must\\nbe got off, however.”\\n“I am a dying man,” said old Turner. “I have had diabetes for years. My\\ndoctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather\\ndie under my own roof than in a gaol.”\\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle\\nof paper before him. “Just tell us the truth,” he said. “I shall jot down the\\nfacts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce\\nyour confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise\\nyou that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.”\\n“It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a question whether I shall live to the\\nAssizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the\\nshock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time\\nin the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\\n“You didn’t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell\\nyou that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has\\nbeen upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I’ll tell you\\nfirst how I came to be in his power.\\n“It was in the early ‘60’s at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hotblooded\\nand reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad\\ncompanions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush,\\nand in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber.\\nThere were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station\\nfrom time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.\\nBlack Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still\\nremembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\\n“One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we\\nlay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it\\nwas a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley.\\nThree of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my\\npistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I\\nwish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his\\nwicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature.\\nWe got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over\\nto England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and\\ndetermined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this\\nestate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little\\ngood with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I\\nmarried, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little\\nAlice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me\\ndown the\\n135\\nright path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf\\nand did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when\\nMcCarthy laid his grip upon me.\\n“I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street\\nwith hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\\n“‘Here we are, Jack,’ says he, touching me on the arm; ‘we’ll be as good as\\na family to you. There’s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the\\nkeeping of us. If you don’t—it’s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and\\nthere’s always a policeman within hail.’\\n“Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off,\\nand there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no\\nrest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his\\ncunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he\\nsoon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police.\\nWhatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without\\nquestion, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could\\nnot give. He asked for Alice.\\n“His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to\\nbe in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step\\ninto the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed\\nstock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood\\nwas in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I\\nbraved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between\\nour houses to talk it over.\\n“When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a\\ncigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to\\nhis talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He\\nwas urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she\\nmight think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to\\nthink that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a\\nman as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a\\ndesperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that\\nmy own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved\\nif I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it\\nagain. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for\\nit. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me\\nwas more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction\\nthan if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his\\nson; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back\\nto fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story,\\ngentlemen, of all that occurred.”\\n“Well, it is not for me to judge you,” said Holmes as the old man signed the\\nstatement which had been drawn out. “I pray\\n137\\nthat we may never be exposed to such a temptation.” “I pray not, sir. And\\nwhat do you intend to do?” “In view of your health, nothing. You are\\nyourself aware\\nthat you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the\\nAssizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall\\nbe forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your\\nsecret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.”\\n“Farewell, then,” said the old man solemnly. “Your own deathbeds, when\\nthey come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have\\ngiven to mine.” Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled\\nslowly from the room.\\n“God help us!” said Holmes after a long silence. “Why does fate play such\\ntricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I\\ndo not think of Baxter’s words, and say, ‘There, but for the grace of God,\\ngoes Sherlock Holmes.’”\\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number\\nof objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the\\ndefending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview,\\nbut he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter\\nmay come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which\\nrests upon their past.\\nAdventure 5.\\nThe Five Orange Pips\\nWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases\\nbetween the years ’82 and ’90, I am faced by so many which present\\nstrange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to\\nchoose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity\\nthrough the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar\\nqualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the\\nobject of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical\\nskill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while\\nothers have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations\\nfounded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical\\nproof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last\\n139\\nwhich was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am\\ntempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in\\nconnection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,\\nentirely cleared up.\\nThe year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less\\ninterest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one\\ntwelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber,\\nof the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower\\nvault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the\\nBritish barque “Sophy Anderson”, of the singular adventures of the Grice\\nPatersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning\\ncase. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by\\nwinding up the dead man’s watch, to prove that it had been wound up two\\nhours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that\\ntime—a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the\\ncase. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them\\npresent such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I\\nhave now taken up my pen to describe.\\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in\\nwith exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had\\nbeaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, handmade\\nLondon we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the\\nroutine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces\\nwhich shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed\\nbeasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and\\nthe wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat\\nmoodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime,\\nwhile I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories until\\nthe howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the\\nsplash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My\\nwife was on a visit to her mother’s, and for a few days I was a dweller once\\nmore in my old quarters at Baker Street.\\n“Why,” said I, glancing up at my companion, “that was surely the bell. Who\\ncould come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?”\\n“Except yourself I have none,” he answered. “I do not encourage visitors.”\\n“A client, then?”\\n“If so, it is a serio us case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day\\nand at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of\\nthe landlady’s.”\\nSherlock Holme s was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a\\nstep in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm\\nto turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon\\nwhich a newcomer must sit.\\n141 “Come in!” said he.\\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside,\\nwell-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy\\nin his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his\\nlong shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had\\ncome. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could\\nsee that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is\\nweighed down with some great anxiety.\\n“I owe you an apology,” he said, raising his golden pincenez to his eyes. “I\\ntrust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the\\nstorm and rain into your snug chamber.”\\n“Give me your coat and umbrella,” said Holmes. “They may rest here on\\nthe hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the south-west,\\nI see.”\\n“Yes, from Horsham.”\\n“That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite\\ndistinctive.”\\n“I have com e for advice.”\\n“That is easily got.”\\n“And help.”\\n“That is not always so easy.”\\n“I have heard of you, Mr. Ho lmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you\\nsaved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.”\\n“Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.”\\n“He said that you could solve anything.”\\n“He said too much.”\\n“That you are never beaten.”\\n“I have been beaten four times—three times by men, and once by a\\nwoman.”\\n“But wha t is that compared with the number of your successes?”\\n“It is true that I have been generally successful.”\\n“Then you may be so with me.”\\n“I beg that you will draw your c hair up to the fire and favour me with some\\ndetails as to your case.”\\n“It is no ordinary one.”\\n“None of those which c ome to me are. I am the last court of appeal.”\\n“And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you hav e ever\\nlistened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those\\nwhich have happened in my own family.”\\n“You fill me with interest,” said Holmes . “Pray give us the essential facts\\nfrom the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those\\ndetails which seem to me to be most important.”\\nThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed h is wet feet out towards the\\nblaze.\\n“My n ame,” said he, “is John Openshaw, but my own af\\n143\\nfairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It\\nis a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go\\nback to the commencement of the affair.\\n“You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle Elias and my\\nfather Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged\\nat the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the\\nOpenshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he\\nwas able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.\\n“My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and\\nbecame a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well.\\nAt the time of the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and afterwards under\\nHood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my\\nuncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years.\\nAbout 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in\\nSussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the\\nStates, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and\\nhis dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He\\nwas a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he\\nwas angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he\\nlived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden\\nand two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his\\nexercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his\\nroom. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he\\nwould see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own\\nbrother.\\n“He didn’t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he\\nsaw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year\\n1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my\\nfather to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When\\nhe was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with\\nme, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and\\nwith the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite\\nmaster of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do\\nwhat I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one\\nsingular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up\\namong the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never\\npermit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy’s curiosity I have\\npeeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a\\ncollection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.\\n“One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon\\nthe table in front of the colonel’s plate. It was not a common thing for him\\nto receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no\\nfriends of any sort. ‘From India!’ said he as he took it up, ‘Pondicherry\\npostmark!\\n145\\nWhat can this be?’ Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried\\norange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this,\\nbut the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had\\nfallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared\\nat the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’ he\\nshrieked, and then, ‘My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!’\\n“‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried.\\n“‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving\\nme palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red\\nink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times\\nrepeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the\\nreason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I\\nascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which\\nmust have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a\\ncashbox, in the other.\\n“‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them still,’ said he with\\nan oath. ‘Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send\\ndown to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’\\n“I did as he ordered, and when the lawye r arrived I was asked to step up to\\nthe room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass\\nof black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open\\nand empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon\\nthe lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the\\nenvelope.\\n“‘I wish y ou, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness my will. I leave my estate,\\nwith all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father,\\nwhence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well\\nand good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to\\nyour deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I\\ncan’t say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where\\nMr. Fordham shows you.’\\n“I signed the paper as dire cted, and the lawyer took it away with him. The\\nsingular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me,\\nand I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being\\nable to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of\\ndread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks\\npassed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I\\ncould see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he\\nwas less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in\\nhis room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would\\nemerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and\\ntear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was\\nafraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen,\\nby man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush\\ntumultuously in at\\n147\\nthe door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out\\nno longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times\\nI have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it\\nwere new raised from a basin.\\n“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your\\npatience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies\\nfrom which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for\\nhim, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of\\nthe garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two\\nfeet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought\\nin a verdict of ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew how he winced from the very\\nthought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of\\nhis way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into\\npossession of the estate, and of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit\\nat the bank.”\\n“One moment,” Holmes interposed, “your statement is, I foresee, one of the\\nmost remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the\\nreception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.”\\n“The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,\\nupon the night of May 2nd.”\\n“Thank you. Pray proceed.”\\n“When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made\\na careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We\\nfound the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the\\ninside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated\\nupon it, and ‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’ written beneath.\\nThese, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been\\ndestroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much\\nimportance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books\\nbearing upon my uncle’s life in America. Some of them were of the war\\ntime and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of\\na brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the\\nSouthern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had\\nevidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had\\nbeen sent down from the North.\\n“Well, it was the beginning of ’8 4 when my father came to live at Horsham,\\nand all went as well as possible with us until the January of ’85. On the\\nfourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise\\nas we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly\\nopened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched\\npalm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cockand-\\nbull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now\\nthat the same thing had come upon himself.\\n“‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John? ’ he stammered.\\n149 “My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’ said I.\\n“He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried. ‘Here are the very\\nletters. But what is this written above them?’\\n“‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peepi ng over his shoulder.\\n“‘What papers? What sundial?’ he asked.\\n“‘The sundial in the garden. There is no other,’ said I; ‘but the papers must\\nbe those that are destroyed.’\\n“‘Pooh!’ said he, gripping h ard at his courage. ‘We are in a civilised land\\nhere, and we can’t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come\\nfrom?’\\n“‘From Dundee,’ I answered, glancing at the postmark.\\n“‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he. ‘What have I to do with\\nsundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.’\\n“‘I should certainly speak to the police,’ I said.\\n“‘And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of t he sort.’\\n“‘Then let me do so?’\\n“‘No, I forbid you. I w on’t have a fuss made about such nonsense.’\\n“It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate ma n. I went\\nabout, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\\n“On the third day after the coming of the letter my father w ent from home\\nto visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of\\nthe forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to\\nme that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that,\\nhowever, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a\\ntelegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had\\nfallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood,\\nand was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he\\npassed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it\\nappears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country\\nwas unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation\\nin bringing in a verdict of ‘death from accidental causes.’ Carefully as I\\nexamined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything\\nwhich could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no\\nfootmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the\\nroads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and\\nthat I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\\n“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did\\nnot dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles\\nwere in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s life, and that\\nthe danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.\\n“It was in January, ’85, that my poor father met his end, an d two years and\\neight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily\\nat Horsham, and I had begun to\\n151\\nhope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended\\nwith the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however;\\nyesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come\\nupon my father.”\\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning\\nto the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\\n“This is the envelope,” he continued. “The postmark is London—eastern\\ndivision. Within are the very words which were upon my father’s last\\nmessage: ‘K. K. K.’; and then ‘Put the papers on the sundial.’”\\n“What have you done?” asked Holmes.\\n“Nothing.”\\n“Nothing?”\\n“To tell the truth”—he sank his face into his thin, white\\nhands—”I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when\\nthe snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless,\\ninexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.”\\n“Tut! tut!” cried Sherlock Holmes. “You must act, man, or you are lost.\\nNothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.”\\n“I have seen the police.”\\n“Ah!”\\n“But th ey listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced\\nthat the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical\\njokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury\\nstated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.”\\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. “Incredible imbecility!” he\\ncried.\\n“They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the\\nhouse with me.”\\n“Has he come w ith you to-night?”\\n“No. His orders were to stay in the house.”\\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\\n“Why did you come to me,” he cried, “and, above all, why did you not\\ncome at once?”\\n“I did not know . It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about\\nmy troubles and was advised by him to come to you.”\\n“It is really two days since you had the letter. We sho uld have acted before\\nthis. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have\\nplaced before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?”\\n“There is one thing,” said John Openshaw. He rummaged in hi s coat pocket,\\nand, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out\\nupon the table. “I have some remembrance,” said he, “that on the day when\\nmy uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins\\nwhich lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single\\nsheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to\\n153\\nthink that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from\\namong the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the\\nmention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a\\npage from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.”\\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which\\nshowed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was\\nheaded, “March, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical\\nnotices:\\n“4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\\n“7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramo re, and John\\nSwain, of St. Augustine.\\n“9th. McCauley cleared.\\n“10th. John Swain cleare d.\\n“12th. Visited Paramore. A ll well.”\\n“Thank you!” said Holmes, foldin g up the paper and returning it to our\\nvisitor. “And now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot\\nspare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home\\ninstantly and act.”\\n“What shall I do?”\\n“There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this\\npiece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have\\ndescribed. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were\\nburned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must\\nassert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done\\nthis, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you\\nunderstand?”\\n“Entirely.”\\n“Do not thi nk of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we\\nmay gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while\\ntheirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing\\ndanger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to\\npunish the guilty parties.”\\n“I thank you,” said the yo ung man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. “You\\nhave given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise.”\\n“Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the\\nmeanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are\\nthreatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?”\\n“By train from Waterloo.”\\n“It is not yet nine. The stre ets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in\\nsafety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.”\\n“I am armed.”\\n“That is well. T o-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.”\\n“I shall see you at Horsham, then?”\\n“No, your secret lies in London. It i s there that I shall seek it.”\\n155\\n“Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box\\nand the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.” He shook hands\\nwith us and took his leave. Outside the wind still screamed and the rain\\nsplashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed\\nto have come to us from amid the mad elements—blown in upon us like a\\nsheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now to have been reabsorbed by them\\nonce more.\\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward\\nand his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and\\nleaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased\\neach other up to the ceiling.\\n“I think, Watson,” he remarked at last, “that of all our cases we have had\\nnone more fantastic than this.”\\n“Save, perhaps, the Sign of Fou r.”\\n“Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. An d yet this John Openshaw seems to me to\\nbe walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.”\\n“But have you,” I asked, “formed any definite conception as to what these\\nperils are?”\\n“There can be no question as to their nature,” he answered.\\n“Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why doe s he pursue this\\nunhappy family?”\\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of\\nhis chair, with his finger-tips together. “The ideal reasoner,” he remarked,\\n“would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings,\\ndeduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all\\nthe results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a\\nwhole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who\\nhas thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to\\naccurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet\\ngrasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be\\nsolved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution\\nby the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is\\nnecessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have\\ncome to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a\\npossession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education\\nand encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so\\nimpossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is\\nlikely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my\\ncase to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of\\nour friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.”\\n“Yes,” I answered, laughing. “It was a singular docume nt. Philosophy,\\nastronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable,\\ngeology profound as regards the mudstains from any region within fifty\\nmiles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational\\nliterature and\\n157\\ncrime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and selfpoisoner\\nby cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of\\nmy analysis.”\\nHolmes grinned at the last item. “Well,” he said, “I say now, as I said then,\\nthat a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture\\nthat he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of\\nhis library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the\\none which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all\\nour resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the ‘American\\nEncyclopaedia’ which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now\\nlet us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the\\nfirst place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw\\nhad some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do\\nnot change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of\\nFlorida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love\\nof solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or\\nsomething, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of\\nsomeone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was\\nhe feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters\\nwhich were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the\\npostmarks of those letters?”\\n“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third\\nfrom London.”\\n“From East L ondon. What do you deduce from that?” “They are all\\nseaports. That the writer was on board of a\\nship.”\\n“Exce llent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt\\nthat the probability—the strong probability—is that the wr iter\\nwas on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point .\\nIn the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the\\nthreat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or\\nfour days. Does that suggest anything?”\\n“A greater distance to travel.”\\n“But the letter had also a grea ter distance to come.” “Then I do not see the\\npoint.”\\n“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which\\nthe man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they a lways\\nsend their singular warning or token before them when start ing upon their\\nmission. You see how quickly the deed followed\\nthe sign when it came from Dundee. If they had c ome from\\nPondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as\\nsoon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elap sed.\\nI think that those seven weeks represented the difference betwee n the mailboat\\nwhich brought the letter and the sailing\\nvessel which brought the writer.”\\n“It is possible.”\\n“More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly\\nurgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to\\ncaution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time\\n159\\nwhich it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes\\nfrom London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.”\\n“Good God!” I cried. “What can it mean, this relentless persecution?”\\n“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importa nce to\\nthe person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that\\nthere must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried\\nout two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s jury. There must\\nhave been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and\\ndetermination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it\\nmay. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual\\nand becomes the badge of a society.”\\n“But of what society?”\\n“Have you never—” s aid Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking\\nhis voice—”have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”\\n“I never have.”\\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. “Here it is,” said\\nhe presently:\\n“‘Ku Klux K lan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the\\nsound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed\\nby some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War,\\nand it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country,\\nnotably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its\\npower was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the\\nnegro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who\\nwere opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning\\nsent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape—a\\nsprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On\\nreceiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or\\nmight fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would\\nunfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen\\nmanner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its\\nmethods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded\\nin braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced\\nhome to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite\\nof the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of\\nthe community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement\\nrather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of\\nthe same sort since that date.’\\n“You will observe,” said Holm es, laying down the volume, “that the sudden\\nbreaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of\\nOpenshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause\\nand effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more\\nimplacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and\\n161\\ndiary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may\\nbe many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.”\\n“Then the page we have seen—”\\n“Is such as we might expect. It ra n, if I remember right, ‘sent the pips to A,\\nB, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them. Then there are\\nsuccessive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that\\nC was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that\\nwe may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only\\nchance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him.\\nThere is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my\\nviolin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the\\nstill more miserable ways of our fellow-men.”\\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued\\nbrightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock\\nHolmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\\n“You will excuse me for not waiting for you,” said h e; “I have, I foresee, a\\nvery busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw’s.”\\n“What steps will you take?” I asked.\\n“It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may have\\nto go down to Horsham, after all.”\\n“You will not go there first?”\\n“No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will\\nbring up your coffee.”\\nAs I waited, I lifted th e unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my\\neye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.\\n“Holmes,” I cried, “you are too late.”\\n“Ah!” said he, laying down his cup, “I feared as much. How was it done?”\\nHe spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\\n“My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading ‘Tragedy Near\\nWaterloo Bridge.’ Here is the account:\\n“Between nine and ten last night Polic e-Constable Cook, of the H Division,\\non duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water.\\nThe night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the\\nhelp of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The\\nalarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body\\nwas eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose\\nname, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was\\nJohn Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured\\nthat he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo\\nStation, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path\\nand walked over the edge of one of the small landingplaces for river\\nsteamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no\\ndoubt that the deceased had been\\n163\\nthe victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of\\ncalling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside\\nlanding-stages.”\\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken\\nthan I had ever seen him.\\n“That hurts my pride, W atson,” he said at last. “It is a petty feeling, no\\ndoubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now,\\nand, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he\\nshould come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death\\n—!” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable\\nagitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and\\nunclasping of his long thin hands.\\n“They must be cunning devils,” h e exclaimed at last. “How could they have\\ndecoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the\\nstation. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for\\ntheir purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am\\ngoing out now!”\\n“To the police?”\\n“No; I shall be m y own police. When I have spun the web they may take the\\nflies, but not before.”\\nAll day I was engag ed in my professional work, and it was late in the\\nevening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come\\nback yet. It was nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale and\\nworn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he\\ndevoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.\\n“You are hungry,” I remarked.\\n“Starving. It had escaped my m emory. I have had nothing since breakfast.”\\n“Nothing?”\\n“Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.”\\n“And how have you succeeded?”\\n“Well.”\\n“You ha ve a clue?”\\n“I have them in th e hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long\\nremain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark\\nupon them. It is well thought of!”\\n“What do you mean?”\\nHe took an orange fro m the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed\\nout the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an\\nenvelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote “S. H. for J. O.” Then he sealed\\nit and addressed it to “Captain James Calhoun, Barque ‘Lone Star,’\\nSavannah, Georgia.”\\n“That will await him when he enters port,” said he, chuckling. “It may give\\nhim a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as\\nOpenshaw did before him.”\\n“And who is this Captain Ca lhoun?”\\n“The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.”\\n165 “How did you trace it, then?”\\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and\\nnames.\\n“I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over Lloyd’s registers and files of\\nthe old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at\\nPondicherry in January and February in ’83. There were thirty-six ships of\\nfair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one,\\nthe ‘Lone Star,’ instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was\\nreported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to\\none of the states of the Union.”\\n“Texas, I think.”\\n“I was not and a m not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an\\nAmerican origin.”\\n“What then?”\\n“I searched th e Dundee records, and when I found that the barque ‘Lone\\nStar’ was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. I then\\ninquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London.”\\n“Yes?”\\n“The ‘L one Star’ had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert\\nDock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this\\nmorning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned\\nthat she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no\\ndoubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of\\nWight.”\\n“What w ill you do, then?”\\n“Oh, I have my hand upo n him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the\\nonly native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans.\\nI know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it\\nfrom the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their\\nsailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and\\nthe cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three\\ngentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.”\\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the\\nmurderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which\\nwould show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves,\\nwas upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales\\nthat year. We waited long for news of the “Lone Star” of Savannah, but\\nnone ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the\\nAtlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of\\na wave, with the letters “L. S.” carved upon it, and that is all which we shall\\never know of the fate of the “Lone Star.”\\nAdventure 6.\\nThe Man with the Twisted Lip.\\nIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the\\nTheological College of St. George’s, was much addicted to opium. The\\nhabit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was\\nat college; for having read De Quincey’s description of his dreams and\\nsensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to\\nproduce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the\\npractice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he\\ncontinued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to\\nhis friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face,\\ndrooping lids, and pinpoint pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin\\nof a noble man.\\n167\\nOne night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell, about the\\nhour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in\\nmy chair, and my wife laid her needlework down in her lap and made a\\nlittle face of disappointment.\\n“A patient!” said she. “You’ll have to go out.”\\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day. We heard the door\\nopen, a few hurried words, and then\\nquick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in\\nsome dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\\n“You will excuse my calling so late,” she began, and then, suddenly losing\\nher self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife’s neck, and\\nsobbed upon her shoulder. “Oh, I’m in such trouble!” she cried; “I do so\\nwant a little help.”\\n“Why,” said my wife, pulling up her veil, “it is Kate Whitney. How you\\nstartled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.”\\n“I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.” That was always the\\nway. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.\\n“It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and\\nwater, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather\\nthat I sent James off to bed?”\\n“Oh, no, no! I want the doctor’s advice and help, too. It’s about Isa. He has\\nnot been home for two days. I am so fright\\n169 ened about him!”\\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s trouble,\\nto me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We\\nsoothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know\\nwhere her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to\\nher?\\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when\\nthe fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City.\\nHitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come\\nback, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been\\nupon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the\\ndregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There\\nhe was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper\\nSwandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid\\nwoman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from\\namong the ruffians who surrounded him?\\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I\\nnot escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she\\ncome at all? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as such I had\\ninfluence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her\\non my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he\\nwere indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I\\nhad left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding\\neastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time,\\nthough the future only could show how strange it was to be.\\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper\\nSwandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line\\nthe north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slopshop\\nand a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a\\nblack gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in\\nsearch. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in\\nthe centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a\\nflickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into\\na long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and\\nterraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.\\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in\\nstrange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back,\\nand chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye\\nturned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little\\nred circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or\\nwaned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some\\nmuttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low,\\nmonotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly\\ntailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying\\nlittle heed to\\n171\\nthe words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of\\nburning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a\\ntall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows\\nupon his knees, staring into the fire.\\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me\\nand a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\\n“Thank you. I have not come to stay,” said I. “There is a friend of mine\\nhere, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.”\\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering\\nthrough the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out\\nat me.\\n“My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with\\nevery nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?”\\n“Nearly eleven.”\\n“Of what day?”\\n“Of Friday, June 19th.”\\n“Good heavens! I thoug ht it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d’you\\nwant to frighten a chap for?” He sank his face onto his arms and began to\\nsob in a high treble key.\\n“I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days\\nfor you. You should be ashamed of yourself!”\\n“So I am. But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few\\nhours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But I’ll go home with\\nyou. I wouldn’t frighten Kate— poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have\\nyou a cab?”\\n“Yes, I have one waiting.”\\n“Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson.\\nI am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.”\\nI walked down the narrow passage between th e double row of sleepers,\\nholding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and\\nlooking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the\\nbrazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, “Walk\\npast me, and then look back at me.” The words fell quite distinctly upon my\\near. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my\\nside, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent\\nwith age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though\\nit had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward\\nand looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking\\nout into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could\\nsee him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes\\nhad regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my\\nsurprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to\\nme to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the\\ncompany once more, subsided into a doddering,\\n173\\nloose-lipped senility.\\n“Holmes!” I whisper ed, “what on earth are you doing in\\nthis den?”\\n“As low as you can,” he answered; “I have excellent ears. If\\nyou would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish\\nfriend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk\\nwith you.”\\n“I have a c ab outside.”\\n“Then pray send him h ome in it. You may safely trust him,\\nfor he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I sho uld\\nrecommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your\\nwife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If yo u\\nwill wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.” It was difficult to\\nrefuse any of Sherlock Holmes’ requests,\\nfor they were always so exceedingly defin ite, and put forward\\nwith such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when\\nWhitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically\\naccomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything\\nbetter than to be associated with my friend in one of those\\nsingular adventures which were the normal condition of hi s\\nexistence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid\\nWhitney’s bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven\\nthrough the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure\\nhad emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down\\nthe street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled\\nalong with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round,\\nhe straightened himself out and burst into a\\nhearty fit of laughter.\\n“I suppose, Watson,” said he, “that you imagine that I have\\nadded opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the oth er\\nlittle weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your\\nmedical views.”\\n“I was certainly surprised to find you there.”\\n“But not more so than I to find you.”\\n“I came to find a friend.”\\n“And I to find an enemy.”\\n“An enemy?”\\n“Yes; one of m y natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural\\nprey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkabl e\\ninquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent\\nramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been\\nrecognised in that den my life would not have been worth an\\nhour’s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and\\nthe rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have\\nvengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the ba ck of that\\nbuilding, near the corner of Paul’s Wharf, which could tell s ome\\nstrange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless\\nnights.”\\n“What! You do not mean bodies?”\\n“Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000\\npounds for every poor devil who has been done to death in\\nthat den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside,\\n175\\nand I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our\\ntrap should be here.” He put his two forefingers between his teeth and\\nwhistled shrilly—a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from\\nthe distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of\\nhorses’ hoofs.\\n“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the\\ngloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side\\nlanterns. “You’ll come with me, won’t you?”\\n“If I can be of use.”\\n“Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My\\nroom at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.”\\n“The Cedars?”\\n“Yes; that is M r. St. Clair’s house. I am staying there while I conduct the\\ninquiry.”\\n“Where i s it, then?”\\n“Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.”\\n“But I am all in the dark.”\\n“Of course you are. You’ ll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All\\nright, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Look out for me tomorrow,\\nabout eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!”\\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the\\nendless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened\\ngradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the\\nmurky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull\\nwilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,\\nregular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated\\nparty of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a\\nstar or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds.\\nHolmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a\\nman who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this\\nnew quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet\\nafraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several\\nmiles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas,\\nwhen he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the\\nair of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\\n“You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,” said he. “It makes y ou quite\\ninvaluable as a companion. ‘Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have\\nsomeone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was\\nwondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she\\nmeets me at the door.”\\n“You forget that I know nothing about it.”\\n“I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee.\\nIt seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon.\\nThere’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end of it into my hand.\\nNow, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe\\nyou can see a spark where all is dark to me.”\\n“Proceed, then.”\\n177\\n“Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to Lee a\\ngentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of\\nmoney. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived\\ngenerally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood,\\nand in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has\\ntwo children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several\\ncompanies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the\\n5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years\\nof age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate\\nfather, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his\\nwhole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain,\\namount to 88 pounds 10s., while he has 220 pounds standing to his credit in\\nthe Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that\\nmoney troubles have been weighing upon his mind.\\n“Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual,\\nremarking before he started that he had two important commissions to\\nperform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now,\\nby the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday,\\nvery shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of\\nconsiderable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the\\noffices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your\\nLondon, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street,\\nwhich branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night.\\nMrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping,\\nproceeded to the company’s office, got her packet, and found herself at\\nexactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the\\nstation. Have you followed me so far?”\\n“It is very clear.”\\n“If you remembe r, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair\\nwalked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not\\nlike the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking\\nin this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry,\\nand was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it\\nseemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window\\nwas open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being\\nterribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished\\nfrom the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked\\nback by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which\\nstruck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat,\\nsuch as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\\n“Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps\\n—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me\\nto-night—and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the\\nstairs which led to\\n179\\nthe first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar\\nscoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a\\nDane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with\\nthe most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare\\ngood-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an\\ninspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men\\naccompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the\\nproprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last\\nbeen seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor\\nthere was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who,\\nit seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no\\none else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined\\nwas their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to\\nbelieve that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at\\na small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there\\nfell a cascade of children’s bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to\\nbring home.\\n“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made\\nthe inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully\\nexamined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room\\nwas plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which\\nlooked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the\\nbedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at\\nhigh tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window\\nwas a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood\\nwere to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were\\nvisible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain\\nin the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the\\nexception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were\\nthere. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and\\nthere were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he\\nmust apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the\\nominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save\\nhimself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of\\nthe tragedy.\\n“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in\\nthe matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but\\nas, by Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the\\nstair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance at the window,\\nhe could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence\\nwas one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge\\nas to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in\\nany way for the presence of the missing gentleman’s clothes.\\n“So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister\\n181\\ncripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was\\ncertainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His\\nname is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every\\nman who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in\\norder to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax\\nvestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the lefthand\\nside, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it\\nis that this creature takes his daily seat, crosslegged with his tiny stock of\\nmatches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity\\ndescends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside\\nhim. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of\\nmaking his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the\\nharvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so\\nremarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of\\norange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its\\ncontraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin,\\nand a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast\\nto the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of\\nmendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any\\npiece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the\\nman whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to\\nhave been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.”\\n“But a cripple!” said I. “What could he have done singlehanded against a\\nman in the prime of life?”\\n“He is a cripple in the sen se that he walks with a limp; but in other respects\\nhe appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical\\nexperience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often\\ncompensated for by exceptional strength in the others.”\\n“Pray continue your narrative.”\\n“Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at t he sight of the blood upon the window, and\\nshe was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of\\nno help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of\\nthe case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without\\nfinding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had\\nbeen made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few\\nminutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the\\nLascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched,\\nwithout anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it\\nis true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his\\nring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the\\nbleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long\\nbefore, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless\\nfrom the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville\\n183\\nSt. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much\\na mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair’s assertion that she\\nhad actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must\\nhave been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to\\nthe policestation, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the\\nhope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\\n“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had\\nfeared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St. Clair,\\nwhich lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found\\nin the pockets?”\\n“I cannot imagine.”\\n“No, I don’t think y ou would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and\\nhalf-pennies—421 pennies and 270 halfpennies. It was no wonder that it\\nhad not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different\\nmatter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed\\nlikely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body\\nhad been sucked away into the river.”\\n“But I understand that all the other cl othes were found in the room. Would\\nthe body be dressed in a coat alone?”\\n“No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this\\nman Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no\\nhuman eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It\\nwould of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale\\ngarments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out,\\nwhen it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little\\ntime, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force\\nher way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate\\nthat the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost.\\nHe rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his\\nbeggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the\\npockets to make sure of the coat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would\\nhave done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of\\nsteps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police\\nappeared.”\\n“It certainl y sounds feasible.”\\n“Well, we will take it as a wo rking hypothesis for want of a better. Boone,\\nas I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be\\nshown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for\\nyears been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have\\nbeen a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and\\nthe questions which have to be solved—what Neville St. Clair was doing in\\nthe opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and\\nwhat Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance—are all as far from a\\nsolution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my\\nexperience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which\\npresented such difficulties.”\\n185\\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we\\nhad been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last\\nstraggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country\\nhedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through\\ntwo scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.\\n“We are on the outskirts of Lee,” said my companion. “We have touched on\\nthree English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing\\nover an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees?\\nThat is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears\\nhave already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse’s feet.”\\n“But why are you not conducting the case from Baker\\nStreet?” I asked.\\n“Because there a re many inquiries which must be made out\\nhere. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my d isposal, and you\\nmay rest assured that she will have nothing but\\na welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate t o meet her,\\nWatson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are .\\nWhoa, there, whoa!”\\nWe had pulled up in f ront of a large villa which stood within\\nits own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head ,\\nand springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding\\ngravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the\\ndoor flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in\\nsome sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at\\nher neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of\\nlight, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body\\nslightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a\\nstanding question.\\n“Well?” she cried, “well?” And then, seeing that there were two of us, she\\ngave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion\\nshook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\\n“No good news?”\\n“None.”\\n“No bad ?”\\n“No.”\\n“Than k God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a\\nlong day.”\\n“This is m y friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in\\nseveral of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to\\nbring him out and associate him with this investigation.”\\n“I am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my hand warmly. “You will,\\nI am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when\\nyou consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.”\\n“My dear madam,” said I, “I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can\\nvery well see that no apology is needed. If I can\\n187 be of any assistance, either t o you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed\\nhappy.”\\n“Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said the lady as we entered a well-lit diningroom,\\nupon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, “I should\\nvery much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that\\nyou will give a plain answer.”\\n“Certainly, madam.”\\n“Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to\\nfainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.”\\n“Upon what point?”\\n“In your heart of hea rts, do you think that Neville is alive?”\\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the que stion. “Frankly,\\nnow!” she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him\\nas he leaned back in a basketchair.\\n“Frankly, then, madam, I do not.”\\n“You think that he is dead?”\\n“I do.”\\n“Murde red?”\\n“I don’t say th at. Perhaps.”\\n“And on what day did he m eet his death?”\\n“On Monday.”\\n“Then perhaps , Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is\\nthat I have received a letter from him to-day.”\\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.\\n“What!” he roared.\\n“Yes, to-day.” She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.\\n“May I see it?”\\n“Certainly.”\\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the\\ntable he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair\\nand was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one\\nand was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that\\nvery day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.\\n“Coarse writing,” murmured Holmes. “Surely this is not your husband’s\\nwriting, madam.”\\n“No, but the enclo sure is.”\\n“I perceive also that whoev er addressed the envelope had to go and inquire\\nas to the address.”\\n“How can you tell that?”\\n“The name, you see, is i n perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The\\nrest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used.\\nIf it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep\\nblack shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a\\npause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not\\nfamiliar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as\\ntrifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha!\\n189\\nthere has been an enclosure here!”\\n“Yes, there was a ring. His signet-r ing.”\\n“And you are sure that this is your husba nd’s hand?” “One of his hands.”\\n“One?”\\n“His ha nd when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his\\nusual writing, and yet I know it well.”\\n“‘Dearest do not be frightened. All wil l come well. There is\\na huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wa it\\nin patience.—NEVILLE.’ Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf\\nof a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in\\nGravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has\\nbeen gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who\\nhad been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is\\nyour husband’s hand, madam?”\\n“None. Neville wrote those wor ds.”\\n“And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St.\\nClair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say\\nthat the danger is over.”\\n“But he must be alive, M r. Holmes.”\\n“Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.\\nThe ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken\\nfrom him.”\\n“No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!”\\n“Very well. It may, however, have been w ritten on Monday\\nand only posted to-day.”\\n“That is possible.”\\n“If so, much may h ave happened between.”\\n“Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holm es. I know\\nthat all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy b etween\\nus that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day\\nthat I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in\\nthe dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that\\nsomething had happened. Do you think that I would\\nrespond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his d eath?” “I have seen too\\nmuch not to know that the impression of a\\nwoman may be more valuable than the con clusion of an analytical reasoner.\\nAnd in this letter you certainly have a very\\nstrong piece of evidence to corroborate you r view. But if your\\nhusband is alive and able to write letters, why should he rema in away from\\nyou?”\\n“I can not imagine. It is unthinkable.”\\n“And on Monday he made no remark s before leaving you?” “No.”\\n“And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?” “Very mu ch so.”\\n“Was the window open?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Then he might have called to you?”\\n“He might.”\\n“He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?” “Yes.”\\n191\\n“A call for help, you thought?”\\n“Yes. He waved his hands.”\\n“But it might have been a cr y of surprise. Astonishment at\\nthe unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?”\\n“It is possible.”\\n“And you thoug ht he was pulled back?”\\n“He disappeared so suddenly.”\\n“He might have leaped back. Y ou did not see anyone else in the room?”\\n“No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the La scar\\nwas at the foot of the stairs.”\\n“Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes\\non?”\\n“But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.”\\n“Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?”\\n“Never.”\\n“Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?”\\n“Never.”\\n“Thank y ou, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I\\nwished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then\\nretire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.”\\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room ha d been placed at our\\ndisposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my\\nnight of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he\\nhad an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a\\nweek, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from\\nevery point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself\\nthat his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now\\npreparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on\\na large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting\\npillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these\\nhe constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself\\ncross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out\\nin front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old\\nbriar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the\\nceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the\\nlight shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off\\nto sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up,\\nand I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still\\nbetween his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a\\ndense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had\\nseen upon the previous night.\\n“Awake, Watson?” he asked.\\n“Yes.”\\n“Game for a morning drive?”\\n“Certainly.”\\n193\\n“Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps,\\nand we shall soon have the trap out.” He chuckled to himself as he spoke,\\nhis eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of\\nthe previous night.\\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was\\nstirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when\\nHolmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.\\n“I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his boots. “I\\nthink, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most\\nabsolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross.\\nBut I think I have the key of the affair now.”\\n“And where is it?” I asked, smiling.\\n“In the bathroom,” he answered. “O h, yes, I am not joking,” he continued,\\nseeing my look of incredulity. “I have just been there, and I have taken it\\nout, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall\\nsee whether it will not fit the lock.”\\nWe made our way downstairs as qu ietly as possible, and out into the bright\\nmorning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad\\nstable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed\\ndown the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in\\nvegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as\\nsilent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\\n“It has been in some points a singular case ,” said Holmes, flicking the horse\\non into a gallop. “I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is\\nbetter to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.”\\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their\\nwindows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down\\nthe Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up\\nWellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow\\nStreet. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two\\nconstables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse’s head while\\nthe other led us in.\\n“Who is on duty?” asked Holmes.\\n“Inspector Bradstreet, sir.”\\n“Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?” A tall, stout official had come down the\\nstone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. “I wish to have a\\nquiet word with you, Bradstreet.” “Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my\\nroom here.” It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the\\ntable, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at\\nhis desk.\\n“What ca n I do for you, Mr. Holmes?”\\n“I called about that beggarman, Boo ne—the one who was charged with\\nbeing concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.”\\n195\\n“Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.”\\n“So I heard. You have him here?”\\n“In the cells.”\\n“Is he quiet?”\\n“Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.”\\n“Dirty?”\\n“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as\\nblack as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a\\nregular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me\\nthat he needed it.”\\n“I should like to se e him very much.”\\n“Would you? That is easily done. Com e this way. You can leave your bag.”\\n“No, I think that I’ll take it.”\\n“Very good. Come this way , if you please.” He led us down a passage,\\nopened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a\\nwhitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\\n“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “He re it is!” He quietly\\nshot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.\\n“He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very well.”\\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards\\nus, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middlesized\\nman, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt\\nprotruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had\\nsaid, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not\\nconceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right\\nacross it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of\\nthe upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock\\nof very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\\n“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.\\n“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked H olmes. “I had an idea that he\\nmight, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” He opened the\\nGladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large\\nbath-sponge.\\n“He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.\\n“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we\\nwill soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”\\n“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “He do esn’t look a credit\\nto the Bow Street cells, does he?” He slipped his key into the lock, and we\\nall very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled\\ndown once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug,\\nmoistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down\\nthe prisoner’s face.\\n“Let me introduce y ou,” he shouted, “to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the\\ncounty of Kent.”\\n197\\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off under\\nthe sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone,\\ntoo, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip\\nwhich had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the\\ntangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced,\\nrefined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes\\nand staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising\\nthe exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face\\nto the pillow.\\n“Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the missing man. I know\\nhim from the photograph.”\\nThe prisoner turned with th e reckless air of a man who abandons himself to\\nhis destiny. “Be it so,” said he. “And pray what am I charged with?”\\n“With making away with Mr. Neville St.— Oh, come, you can’t be charged\\nwith that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,” said the\\ninspector with a grin. “Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force,\\nbut this really takes the cake.”\\n“If I am Mr. Neville St. Clai r, then it is obvious that no crime has been\\ncommitted, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.”\\n“No crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said Holmes. “You\\nwould have done better to have trusted you wife.”\\n“It was not the wife; it was the children,” groane d the prisoner. “God help\\nme, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an\\nexposure! What can I do?”\\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly\\non the shoulder.\\n“If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said he, “of course\\nyou can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the\\npolice authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know\\nthat there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers.\\nInspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you\\nmight tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then\\nnever go into court at all.”\\n“God bless you!” cried th e prisoner passionately. “I would have endured\\nimprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret\\nas a family blot to my children.\\n“You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a\\nschoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I\\ntravelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an\\nevening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of\\narticles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them.\\nThere was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by\\ntrying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base\\nmy articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of\\nmaking up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took\\nadvantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as\\npitiable as\\n199\\npossible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the\\naid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair,\\nand an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city,\\nostensibly as a matchseller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied\\nmy trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise\\nthat I had received no less than 26s. 4d.\\n“I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time\\nlater, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for 25\\npounds. I was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea\\ncame to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked for a\\nholiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under\\nmy disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\\n“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at 2\\npounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing\\nmy face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It\\nwas a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at\\nlast, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had\\nfirst chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with\\ncoppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in\\nwhich I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning\\nemerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a\\nwell-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me\\nfor his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\\n“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I\\ndo not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn 700 pounds\\na year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional\\nadvantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee,\\nwhich improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in\\nthe City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me,\\nand it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pounds.\\n“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and\\neventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real\\noccupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little\\nknew what.\\n“Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room\\nabove the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my\\nhorror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her\\neyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover\\nmy face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent\\nanyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that\\nshe could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a\\nbeggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not\\npierce so complete a\\n201\\ndisguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the\\nroom, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window,\\nreopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in\\nthe bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by\\nthe coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I\\ncarried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the\\nThames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there\\nwas a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather,\\nI confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St.\\nClair, I was arrested as his murderer.\\n“I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was\\ndetermined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my\\npreference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly\\nanxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment\\nwhen no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling\\nher that she had no cause to fear.”\\n“That note only reached her yesterday,” said Holmes. “Good God! What a\\nweek she must have spent!” “The police have watched this Lascar,” said\\nInspector\\nBradstreet, “and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post\\na letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his,\\nwho forgot all about it for some days.”\\n“That was it,” said Holmes, nodding ap provingly; “I have\\nno doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?”\\n“Many times; but what was a fine to me?”\\n“It must stop here, however,” said Bradstr eet. “If the police are to hush this\\nthing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.”\\n“I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.”\\n“In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken.\\nBut if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes,\\nthat we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I\\nwish I knew how you reach your results.”\\n“I reached this one,” said my friend, “ by sitting upon five pillows and\\nconsuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker\\nStreet we shall just be in time for breakfast.”\\n7.\\nThe Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle.\\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning\\nafter Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the\\nseason. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a piperack\\nwithin his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers,\\nevidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden\\nchair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hardfelt\\nhat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and\\na forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been\\nsuspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.\\n“You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt you.” “Not at all. I am glad\\nto have a friend with whom I can\\n203\\ndiscuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one”—he jerked his\\nthumb in the direction of the old hat—”but there are points in connection\\nwith it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.”\\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling\\nfire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice\\ncrystals. “I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as it looks, this thing has\\nsome deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clue which will guide you in\\nthe solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.”\\n“No, no. No crime,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “Only one of those\\nwhimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million\\nhuman beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles.\\nAmid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every\\npossible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a\\nlittle problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without\\nbeing criminal. We have already had experience of such.”\\n“So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six cases which I have added to\\nmy notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.”\\n“Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to\\nthe singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man\\nwith the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall\\ninto the same\\n205\\ninnocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?” “Yes.”\\n“It is to him that this trophy belongs.”\\n“It is his hat.”\\n“No, no, he fo und it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you\\nwill look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem.\\nAnd, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in\\ncompany with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this\\nmoment in front of Peterson’s fire. The facts are these: about four o’clock\\non Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow,\\nwas returning from some small jollification and was making his way\\nhomeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the\\ngaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white\\ngoose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a\\nrow broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the\\nlatter knocked off the man’s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend\\nhimself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind\\nhim. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants;\\nbut the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an officiallooking\\nperson in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to\\nhis heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the\\nback of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance\\nof Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also\\nof the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most\\nunimpeachable Christmas goose.”\\n“Which surely he restored to their owner?”\\n“My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that ‘For Mrs. Henry\\nBaker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird’s left leg,\\nand it is also true that the initials ‘H. B.’ are legible upon the lining of this\\nhat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of\\nHenry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to\\nany one of them.”\\n“What, then, did P eterson do?”\\n“He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,\\nknowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose\\nwe retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the\\nslight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary\\ndelay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of\\na goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who\\nlost his Christmas dinner.”\\n“Did he not advertise?”\\n“No.”\\n“Then , what clue could you have as to his identity?”\\n“Only as much as we can deduce.”\\n“From his hat?”\\n“Precisely.”\\n207\\n“But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?”\\n“Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yours elf as\\nto the individuality of the man who has worn this article?”\\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It\\nwas a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the\\nworse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal\\ndiscoloured. There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the\\ninitials “H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for\\na hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked,\\nexceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to\\nhave been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them\\nwith ink.\\n“I can see nothing,” said I, handing it back to my friend.\\n“On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. Yo u fail, however, to\\nreason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.”\\n“Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”\\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fa shion which\\nwas characteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have\\nbeen,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences which are very\\ndistinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of\\nprobability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon\\nthe face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three\\nyears, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has\\nless now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when\\ntaken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil\\ninfluence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the\\nobvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.”\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\n“He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,” he continued,\\ndisregarding my remonstrance. “He is a man who leads a sedentary life,\\ngoes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair\\nwhich he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with\\nlime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from\\nhis hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid\\non in his house.”\\n“You are certainl y joking, Holmes.”\\n“Not in the least. Is it possible that e ven now, when I give you these results,\\nyou are unable to see how they are attained?”\\n“I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable\\nto follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was\\nintellectual?”\\nFor answer H olmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the\\nforehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question of cubic\\ncapacity,” said he; “a man with so\\n209\\nlarge a brain must have something in it.”\\n“The decline of his fortunes, then?”\\n“This hat is three years old. These fl at brims curled at the\\nedge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of\\nribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so\\nexpensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has\\nassuredly gone down in the world.”\\n“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the\\nmoral retrogression?”\\nSherlock Holmes laug hed. “Here is the foresight,” said he putting his finger\\nupon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They are never sold upon\\nhats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight,\\nsince he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But\\nsince we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it,\\nit is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct\\nproof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to\\nconceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which\\nis a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”\\n“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”\\n“The further points, that he is middle-a ged, that his hair is grizzled, that it\\nhas been recently cut, and that he uses limecream, are all to be gathered\\nfrom a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses\\na large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all\\nappear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This\\ndust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy\\nbrown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of\\nthe time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that\\nthe wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best\\nof training.”\\n“But his wif e—you said that she had ceased to love him.” “This hat has not\\nbeen brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week’s\\naccumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go\\nout in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough\\nto lose your wife’s affection.”\\n“But he might be a bachelor.”\\n“Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.\\nRemember the card upon the bird’s leg.” “You have an answer to\\neverything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his\\nhouse?” “One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I\\nsee no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual\\nmust be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks upstairs\\nat night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the\\nother. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you\\nsatisfied?”\\n“Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since, as\\n211\\nyou said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done\\nsave the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.”\\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open,\\nand Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed\\ncheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\\n“The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!” he gasped. “Eh? What of it,\\nthen? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?”\\nHolmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the\\nman’s excited face.\\n“See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!” He held out his hand\\nand displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue\\nstone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that\\nit twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.\\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. “By Jove, Peterson!” s aid he, “this\\nis treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?”\\n“A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as thoug h it were\\nputty.”\\n“It’s m ore than a precious stone. It is the precious stone.”\\n“Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!” I ejaculat ed.\\n“Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the\\nadvertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely\\nunique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of\\n1000 pounds is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.”\\n“A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!” The commissionaire plumped\\ndown into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\\n“That is the reward, and I have reason to know that th ere are sentimental\\nconsiderations in the background which would induce the Countess to part\\nwith half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.”\\n“It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopo litan,” I remarked.\\n“Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a\\nplumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s jewel-case.\\nThe evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to\\nthe Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.” He\\nrummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he\\nsmoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:\\n“Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumbe r, was\\nbrought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from\\nthe jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the\\nblue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence\\nto the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of\\n213\\nthe Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might\\nsolder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with\\nHorner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he\\nfound that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open,\\nand that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the\\nCountess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the\\ndressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the\\nsame evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in\\nhis rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having\\nheard Ryder’s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having\\nrushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last\\nwitness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of\\nHorner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the\\nstrongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been\\ngiven against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with\\nthe offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of\\nintense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and\\nwas carried out of court.”\\n“Hum! So much for the police-court,” said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing\\naside the paper. “The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events\\nleading from a rifled jewelcase at one end to the crop of a goose in\\nTottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions\\nhave suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect.\\nHere is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from\\nMr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other\\ncharacteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves\\nvery seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has\\nplayed in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means\\nfirst, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening\\npapers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.”\\n“What will you say?”\\n“Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: ‘Found at the corner of\\nGoodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the\\nsame by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.’ That is clear\\nand concise.”\\n“Very. But wi ll he see it?”\\n“Well, he is sure to keep a n eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss\\nwas a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the\\nwindow and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but\\nflight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which\\ncaused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will\\ncause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to\\nit. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this\\nput in the evening papers.”\\n“In which, sir?”\\n215 “Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall M all, St. James’s, Evening\\nNews, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.” “Very well, sir.\\nAnd this stone?”\\n“Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say,\\nPeterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for\\nwe must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your\\nfamily is now devouring.”\\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it\\nagainst the light. “It’s a bonny thing,” said he. “Just see how it glints and\\nsparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is.\\nThey are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may\\nstand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found\\nin the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in\\nhaving every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade\\ninstead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history.\\nThere have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several\\nrobberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of\\ncrystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a\\npurveyor to the gallows and the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now\\nand drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.”\\n“Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?” “I cannot tell.”\\n“Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry\\nBaker, had anything to do with the matter?”\\n“It is, I think, much more likely that Henry B aker is an\\nabsolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which\\nhe was carrying was of considerably more value than if it wer e\\nmade of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very\\nsimple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.” “An d you can do\\nnothing until then?”\\n“Nothing.”\\n“In that cas e I shall continue my professional round. But I\\nshall come back in the evening at the hour you have menti oned, for I should\\nlike to see the solution of so tangled a\\nbusiness.”\\n“Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock,\\nI believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I\\nought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.”\\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a litt le after halfpast six when I\\nfound myself in Baker Street once more. As I\\napproached the house I saw a tall man in a Sc otch bonnet with\\na coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in\\nthe bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. J ust\\nas I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown u p together to\\nHolmes’ room.\\n“Mr. Henry Bak er, I believe,” said he, rising from his armchair and greeting\\nhis visitor with the easy air of geniality which\\nhe could so readily assume. “Pray take this chair by the fire,\\nMr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circula\\n217\\ntion is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just\\ncome at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?”\\n“Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.”\\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad,\\nintelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch\\nof red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand,\\nrecalled Holmes’ surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was\\nbuttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists\\nprotruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a\\nslow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the\\nimpression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage\\nat the hands of fortune.\\n“We have retained these things for some days,” said Holmes, “because we\\nexpected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a\\nloss to know now why you did not advertise.”\\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been so\\nplentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt that the\\ngang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I\\ndid not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering\\nthem.”\\n“Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.”\\n“To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\\n“Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not don e so. But I\\npresume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same\\nweight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?”\\n“Oh, certainly, certainly,” answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\\n“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of y our own\\nbird, so if you wish—”\\nThe man burst into a he arty laugh. “They might be useful to me as relics of\\nmy adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see what use the\\ndisjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I\\nthink that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the\\nexcellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.”\\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me wit h a slight shrug of his\\nshoulders.\\n“There is y our hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By the way, would\\nit bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of\\na fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.”\\n“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained\\nproperty under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn,\\nnear the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day,\\nyou understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a\\ngoose\\n219\\nclub, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were\\neach to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is\\nfamiliar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted\\nneither to my years nor my gravity.” With a comical pomposity of manner\\nhe bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\\n“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes when he had closed the door\\nbehind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the\\nmatter. Are you hungry, Watson?”\\n“Not particularly.”\\n“Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this\\nclue while it is still hot.”\\n“By all means.”\\nIt was a bitter n ight, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about\\nour throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and\\nthe breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots.\\nOur footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors’\\nquarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into\\nOxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha\\nInn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which\\nruns down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar\\nand ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, whiteaproned\\nlandlord.\\n“Your be er should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,” said he.\\n“My geese!” The man seemed surprised.\\n“Yes. I was speaking only half an hour a go to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a\\nmember of your goose club.”\\n“Ah! yes, I see. But you see, s ir, them’s not our geese.”\\n“Indeed! Whose, then?”\\n“Well, I got the two doze n from a salesman in Covent Garden.”\\n“Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?”\\n“Breckinridge is his name.”\\n“Ah! I don’t know him. Well, here’s your good health landlord, and\\nprosperity to your house. Good-night.”\\n“Now for Mr. Breckinridge,” he cont inued, buttoning up his coat as we\\ncame out into the frosty air. “Remember, Watson that though we have so\\nhomely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a\\nman who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless we can\\nestablish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his\\nguilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been\\nmissed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands.\\nLet us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick\\nmarch!”\\nWe pass ed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of\\nslums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of\\nBreckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp\\nface and\\n221\\ntrim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters. “Good-evening.\\nIt’s a cold night,” said Holmes. The salesman nodded and shot a\\nquestioning glance at my\\ncompanion.\\n“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at\\nthe bare slabs of marble.\\n“Let you have five hundr ed to-morrow morning.” “That’s no good.”\\n“Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.” “Ah, bu t I was\\nrecommended to you.”\\n“Who by?”\\n“The landlo rd of the Alpha.”\\n“Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.”\\n“Fine birds they were, too. Now where d id you get them\\nfrom?”\\nTo my s urprise the question provoked a burst of anger from\\nthe salesman.\\n“Now, then, m ister,” said he, with his head cocked and his\\narms akimbo, “what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight,\\nnow.”\\n“It is s traight enough. I should like to know who sold you\\nthe geese which you supplied to the Alpha.”\\n“Well then, I shan’t tell you. So now!”\\n“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; bu t I don’t know why\\nyou should be so warm over such a trifle.”\\n“Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I\\npay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business;\\nbut it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the geese to?’ and\\n‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they were the only\\ngeese in the\\nworld, to he ar the fuss that is made over them.”\\n“Well, I have no connection with any other peop le who\\nhave been making inquiries,” said Holmes carelessly. “I f you\\nwon’t tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I’m always ready to\\nback my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it\\nthat the bird I ate is country bred.”\\n“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,”\\nsnapped the salesman.\\n“It’s nothing of the kin d.”\\n“I say it is.”\\n“I don’t beli eve it.”\\n“D’you think you k now more about fowls than I, who have\\nhandled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those\\nbirds that went to the Alpha were town bred.”\\n“You’ll never persuade me to believe that.”\\n“Will you bet, then?”\\n“It’s merely taking yo ur money, for I know that I am right.\\nBut I’ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to\\nbe obstinate.”\\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. “Bring me the books, Bill,”\\nsaid he.\\nThe sma ll boy brought round a small thin volume and a\\n223 great greasy-backed one, lay ing them out together beneath the hanging\\nlamp.\\n“Now then, Mr. Cocksure,” said the salesman, “I thought that I was out of\\ngeese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still one left in my shop.\\nYou see this little book?”\\n“Well?”\\n“That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see? Well, then, here on\\nthis page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where\\ntheir accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in\\nred ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third\\nname. Just read it out to me.”\\n“Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,” read Holmes.\\n“Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.”\\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. “He re you are, ‘Mrs. Oakshott, 117,\\nBrixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’”\\n“Now, then, what’s the last entry?”\\n“‘December 22nd. Twenty-four gee se at 7s. 6d.’”\\n“Quite so. There you are. And underneath?”\\n“‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s .’”\\n“What have you to say now?”\\nSherlock Holmes looked deep ly chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his\\npocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man\\nwhose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a\\nlamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar\\nto him.\\n“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink ‘un’\\nprotruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,” said he. “I\\ndaresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of him, that man would\\nnot have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by\\nthe idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy,\\nnearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be\\ndetermined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or\\nwhether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly\\nfellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about\\nthe matter, and I should—”\\nHis remarks were suddenl y cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out\\nfrom the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced\\nfellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown\\nby the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door\\nof his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\\n“I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “I wish you were all\\nat the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk\\nI’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I’ll answer her, but\\nwhat have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?”\\n“No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the l ittle man.\\n225\\n“Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”\\n“She told me to ask you.”\\n“Well, you can ask the Kin g of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve\\nhad enough of it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the\\ninquirer flitted away into the darkness.\\n“Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes. “Come\\nwith me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.” Striding\\nthrough the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls,\\nmy companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the\\nshoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every\\nvestige of colour had been driven from his face.\\n“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked in a quavering voice.\\n“You will excuse me,” said Holmes blandly, “but I could not h elp\\noverhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think\\nthat I could be of assistance to you.”\\n“You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?”\\n“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people\\ndon’t know.”\\n“But you can know nothing of this?”\\n“Excuse me, I know everything of i t. You are endeavouring to trace some\\ngeese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman\\nnamed Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by\\nhim to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.”\\n“Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to me et,” cried the little\\nfellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. “I can hardly explain\\nto you how interested I am in this matter.”\\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler wh ich was passing. “In that case we\\nhad better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept marketplace,”\\nsaid he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have\\nthe pleasure of assisting.”\\nThe man hesitated for an instant. “My name is John Robinson,” he\\nanswered with a sidelong glance.\\n“No, no; the real name,” said Ho lmes sweetly. “It is always awkward doing\\nbusiness with an alias.”\\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. “Well then,” said he,\\n“my real name is James Ryder.”\\n“Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the\\ncab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to\\nknow.”\\nThe lit tle man stood glancing from one to the other of us with halffrightened,\\nhalf-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the\\nverge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in\\nhalf an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had\\nbeen said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new\\ncompanion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands,\\n227\\nspoke of the nervous tension within him.\\n“Here we are!” said Holmes cheerily as w e filed into the\\nroom. “The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. Yo u look\\ncold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on\\nmy slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now,\\nthen! You want to know what became of those geese?” “Yes , sir.”\\n“Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine\\nin which you were interested—white, with a black bar acros s\\nthe tail.”\\nRyder qu ivered with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you\\ntell me where it went to?”\\n“It came here.”\\n“Here?”\\n“Yes, an d a most remarkable bird it proved. I don’t wonder\\nthat you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it w as\\ndead—the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen .\\nI have it here in my museum.”\\nOur visitor staggered to his fee t and clutched the mantelpiece with his right\\nhand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box\\nand held up the blue carbuncle, which s hone out like a star,\\nwith a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stoo d glaring with a\\ndrawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown\\nit.\\n“T he game’s up, Ryder,” said Holmes quietly. “Hold up,\\nman, or you’ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back int o his chair, Watson.\\nHe’s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a\\ndash of brandy. So! Now he looks a\\nlittle more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!” For a moment he had\\nstaggered and nearly fallen, but the\\nbrandy brought a tinge of colour int o his cheeks, and he sat\\nstaring with frightened eyes at his accuser.\\n“I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs\\nwhich I could possibly need, so there is little which you n eed\\ntell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the\\ncase complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the\\nCountess of Morcar’s?”\\n“It was Catherine Cusac k who told me of it,” said he in a\\ncrackling voice.\\n“I see—her lady ship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation\\nof sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you , as it\\nhas been for better men before you; but you were not very scrup ulous in the\\nmeans you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there\\nis the making of a very pretty villain in you. You k new that this\\nman Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such\\nmatter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily\\nupon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job\\nin my lady’s room—you and your confederate Cusack—and\\nyou managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when\\nhe had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and ha d\\nthis unfortunate man arrested. You then—”\\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon t he rug and\\n229\\nclutched at my companion’s knees. “For God’s sake, have mercy!” he\\nshrieked. “Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I\\nnever went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I’ll swear it on a\\nBible. Oh, don’t bring it into court! For Christ’s sake, don’t!”\\n“Get back into your chair!” said Holmes sternly. “It is very well to cringe\\nand crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the\\ndock for a crime of which he knew nothing.”\\n“I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against\\nhim will break down.”\\n“Hum! We will talk ab out that. And now let us hear a true account of the\\nnext act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into\\nthe open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.”\\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “I will tell you it just as it\\nhappened, sir,” said he. “When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me\\nthat it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not\\nknow at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search\\nme and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be\\nsafe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister’s\\nhouse. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road,\\nwhere she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met\\nseemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold\\nnight, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton\\nRoad. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I\\ntold her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went\\ninto the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best\\nto do.\\n“I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just\\nbeen serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into\\ntalk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they\\nstole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things\\nabout him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived,\\nand take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone\\ninto money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had\\ngone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized\\nand searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was\\nleaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were\\nwaddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head\\nwhich showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.\\n“My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her\\ngeese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as\\nher word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to\\nKilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of\\nthe birds— a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying\\n231\\nits bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could\\nreach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and\\ndown into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my\\nsister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute\\nbroke loose and fluttered off among the others.\\n“‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ says she.\\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me one for Christmas, and I was\\nfeeling which was the fattest.’\\n“‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yo urs aside for you—Jem’s bird, we call it. It’s\\nthe big white one over yonder. There’s twentysix of them, which makes one\\nfor you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.’\\n“‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the sam e to you, I’d rather\\nhave that one I was handling just now.’\\n“‘The other is a good three pound he avier,’ said she, ‘and we fattened it\\nexpressly for you.’\\n“‘Never mind. I’ll h ave the other, and I’ll take it now,’ said I.\\n“‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed. ‘Which i s it you want,\\nthen?’\\n“‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.’\\n“‘Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.’\\n“Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to\\nKilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to\\ntell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and\\nopened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the\\nstone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird,\\nrushed back to my sister’s, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a\\nbird to be seen there.\\n“‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.\\n“‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.’\\n“‘Which dealer’s?’\\n“‘Breckinridge, of C ovent Garden.’\\n“‘But was there another with a barr ed tail?’ I asked, ‘the same as the one I\\nchose?’\\n“‘Yes, J em; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them\\napart.’\\n“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would\\ncarry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not\\none word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him\\nyourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister\\nthinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now\\n— and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the\\nwealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!” He burst\\ninto convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.\\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy brea thing and by the\\nmeasured tapping of Sherlock Holmes’ finger\\n233\\ntips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the\\ndoor.\\n“Get out!” said he.\\n“What, sir! Oh, He aven bless you!”\\n“No more words. Get out!”\\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the\\nstairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the\\nstreet.\\n“After all, Watson,” said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, “I\\nam not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in\\ndanger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against\\nhim, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony,\\nbut it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong\\nagain; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you make\\nhim a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has\\nput in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its\\nown reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will\\nbegin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature.”\\n8.\\nThe Adventure of the Speckled Band.\\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during\\nthe last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I\\nfind many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none\\ncommonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for\\nthe acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any\\ninvestigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the\\nfantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which\\npresented more singular features than that which was associated with the\\nwell-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in\\nquestion occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when\\nwe were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I\\nmight\\n235\\nhave placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at\\nthe time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the\\nuntimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as\\nwell that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that\\nthere are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott\\nwhich tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.\\nIt was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find\\nSherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a\\nlate riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it\\nwas only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and\\nperhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\\n“Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he, “but it’s the common lot this\\nmorning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on\\nyou.”\\n“What is it, then—a fire?”\\n“No; a client. It seems tha t a young lady has arrived in a considerable state\\nof excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the\\nsitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this\\nhour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I\\npresume that it is something very pressing which they have to\\ncommunicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am\\nsure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should\\ncall you and give you the chance.”\\n“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”\\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Hol mes in his professional\\ninvestigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions,\\nand yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the\\nproblems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and\\nwas ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the\\nsittingroom. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been\\nsitting in the window, rose as we entered.\\n“Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes cheerily. “My name is Sherlock\\nHolmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom\\nyou can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs.\\nHudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I\\nshall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.”\\n“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman in a low vo ice,\\nchanging her seat as requested.\\n“What, then?”\\n“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her veil as she spoke, and we\\ncould see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all\\ndrawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted\\nanimal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair\\nwas shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary\\n237 and haggard. Sherlock Holm es ran her over with one of his quick, allcomprehensive\\nglances.\\n“You must not fear,” said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her\\nforearm. “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come\\nin by train this morning, I see.”\\n“You know me, then?”\\n“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left\\nglove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dogcart,\\nalong heavy roads, before you reached the station.”\\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\\n“There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “The left arm o f\\nyour jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks\\nare perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up\\nmud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the\\ndriver.”\\n“Whate ver your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,” said she. “I\\nstarted from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came\\nin by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall\\ngo mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none, save only one, who\\ncares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you,\\nMr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in\\nthe hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir,\\ndo you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light\\nthrough the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my\\npower to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall\\nbe married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall\\nnot find me ungrateful.”\\nHolmes turned to his de sk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book,\\nwhich he consulted.\\n“Farintosh,” said he . “Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an\\nopal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam,\\nthat I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of\\nyour friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at\\nliberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits\\nyou best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may\\nhelp us in forming an opinion upon the matter.”\\n“Alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation lies in the fact\\nthat my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon\\nsmall points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of\\nall others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell\\nhim about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I\\ncan read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard,\\nMr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the\\nhuman heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which\\nencompass me.”\\n239\\n“I am all attention, madam.”\\n“My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the\\nlast survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of\\nStoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”\\nHolmes nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me,” said he.\\n“The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates\\nextended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the\\nwest. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute\\nand wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a\\ngambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of\\nground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a\\nheavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the\\nhorrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather,\\nseeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an\\nadvance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and\\nwent out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of\\ncharacter, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused\\nby some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his\\nnative butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he\\nsuffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a\\nmorose and disappointed man.\\n“When Dr. Roylott was in In dia he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the\\nyoung widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister\\nJulia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my\\nmother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less than\\n1000 pounds a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while\\nwe resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be\\nallowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return\\nto England my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a railway\\naccident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish\\nhimself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old\\nancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was\\nenough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our\\nhappiness.\\n“But a terr ible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of\\nmaking friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first\\nbeen overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat,\\nhe shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in\\nferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper\\napproaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in\\nmy stepfather’s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence\\nin the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended\\nin the policecourt, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the\\n241 folks would fly at his approa ch, for he is a man of immense strength, and\\nabsolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\\n“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and\\nit was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that\\nI was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save\\nthe wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp\\nupon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family\\nestate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering\\naway with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for\\nIndian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has\\nat this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his\\ngrounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.\\n“You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no\\ngreat pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long\\ntime we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her\\ndeath, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.”\\n“Your sister is dead, then?”\\n“She died just two years ag o, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to\\nyou. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we\\nwere little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had,\\nhowever, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who\\nlives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at\\nthis lady’s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there\\na half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather\\nlearned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection\\nto the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for\\nthe wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only\\ncompanion.”\\nSherlock Ho lmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed\\nand his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced\\nacross at his visitor.\\n“Pray be precise as t o details,” said he.\\n“It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared\\ninto my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and\\nonly one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the\\nground floor, the sittingrooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of\\nthese bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott’s, the second my sister’s, and the\\nthird my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open\\nout into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?”\\n“Perfectly so.”\\n“The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night\\nDr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not\\nretired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian\\ncigars which it was\\n243\\nhis custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine,\\nwhere she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At\\neleven o’clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked\\nback.\\n“‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead\\nof the night?’\\n“‘Never,’ said I.\\n“‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?’\\n“‘Certainly not. But why?’\\n“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the\\nmorning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has\\nawakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next\\nroom, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether\\nyou had heard it.’\\n“‘No, I have not. I t must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.’\\n“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did n ot hear\\nit also.’\\n“‘Ah, bu t I sleep more heavily than you.’\\n“‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at me,\\nclosed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.”\\n“Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at\\nnight?”\\n“Alway s.”\\n“And why? ”\\n“I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon.\\nWe had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”\\n“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”\\n“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeli ng of impending misfortune\\nimpressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you\\nknow how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely\\nallied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was\\nbeating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub\\nof the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew\\nthat it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round\\nme, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a\\nlow whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a\\nclanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage,\\nmy sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared\\nat it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the\\nlight of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face\\nblanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying\\nto and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her,\\nbut at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.\\nShe writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully\\nconvulsed. At first I thought that she\\n245\\nhad not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a\\nvoice which I shall never forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The\\nspeckled band!’ There was something else which she would fain have said,\\nand she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor’s\\nroom, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out,\\ncalling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in\\nhis dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious,\\nand though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from\\nthe village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without\\nhaving recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my\\nbeloved sister.”\\n“One moment,” said Holmes, “are you sure about this whistle and metallic\\nsound? Could you swear to it?”\\n“That was what the county coro ner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong\\nimpression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the\\ncreaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”\\n“Was your sister dressed?”\\n“No, she was in her night -dress. In her right hand was found the charred\\nstump of a match, and in her left a match-box.”\\n“Showing that she had struck a light and looke d about her when the alarm\\ntook place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come\\nto?”\\n“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct had\\nlong been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory\\ncause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon\\nthe inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters\\nwith broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were\\ncarefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the\\nflooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney\\nis wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that\\nmy sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no\\nmarks of any violence upon her.”\\n“How about poison?”\\n“The doctors examine d her for it, but without success.”\\n“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, th en?”\\n“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it\\nwas that frightened her I cannot imagine.”\\n“Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?”\\n“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”\\n“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band— a speckled\\nband?”\\n“Somet imes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,\\nsometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to\\nthese very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted\\nhandkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have\\nsuggested the strange\\n247 adjective which she used.”\\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\\n“These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with your narra tive.”\\n“Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lone lier\\nthan ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for\\nmany years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name\\nis Armitage— Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane\\nWater, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match,\\nand we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some\\nrepairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall\\nhas been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my\\nsister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then,\\nmy thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible\\nfate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had\\nbeen the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing\\nwas to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however,\\nso I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at\\nthe Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I\\nhave come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking\\nyour advice.”\\n“You have do ne wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me all?”\\n“Yes, all.”\\n“Miss Roy lott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.”\\n“Why, what do you mean?”\\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the\\nhand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of\\nfour fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\\n“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.\\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is a hard\\nman,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”\\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chi n upon his\\nhands and stared into the crackling fire.\\n“This is a very deep business,” he said at last. “There are a thousand details\\nwhich I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action.\\nYet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran today,\\nwould it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the\\nknowledge of your stepfather?”\\n“As it happens, he spoke of c oming into town to-day upon some most\\nimportant business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there\\nwould be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old\\nand foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.”\\n249\\n“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?” “By no means.”\\n“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”\\n“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town.\\nBut I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there in time for\\nyour coming.”\\n“And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small\\nbusiness matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?”\\n“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my\\ntrouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.” She\\ndropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.\\n“And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock\\nHolmes, leaning back in his chair.\\n“It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.” “Dark enough and\\nsinister enough.”\\n“Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and\\nwalls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable,\\nthen her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her\\nmysterious end.”\\n“What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very\\npeculiar words of the dying woman?”\\n“I cannot think.”\\n“When you comb ine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of\\ngipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have\\nevery reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his\\nstepdaughter’s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact\\nthat Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been\\ncaused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into\\nits place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be\\ncleared along those lines.”\\n“But what, then, did the gi psies do?”\\n“I cannot imagine.”\\n“I see many objectio ns to any such theory.”\\n“And so do I. It is precisely for that reas on that we are going to Stoke\\nMoran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may\\nbe explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”\\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our\\ndoor had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed\\nhimself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the\\nprofessional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frockcoat,\\nand a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.\\nSo tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway,\\nand his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face,\\nseared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked\\nwith every evil passion, was\\n251\\nturned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bileshot eyes, and his\\nhigh, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce\\nold bird of prey.\\n“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.\\n“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion\\nquietly.\\n“I am D r. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”\\n“Indeed, Doctor,” said Holmes blandly. “Pray t ake a seat.”\\n“I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been h ere. I have traced\\nher. What has she been saying to you?”\\n“It is a little cold for the time of the yea r,” said Holmes.\\n“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old m an furiously.\\n“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continu ed my\\ncompanion imperturbably.\\n“Ha! You put me off, do y ou?” said our new visitor, taking a step forward\\nand shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of\\nyou before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”\\nMy friend smiled.\\n“Holmes, the busy body!”\\nHis smile broadened.\\n“Holmes, the Scotlan d Yard Jack-in-office!”\\nHolmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversat ion is most entertaining,” said\\nhe. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.”\\n“I will go when I have said my say. Don’t you dare to meddle w ith my\\naffairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a\\ndangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward, seized\\nthe poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\\n“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, an d hurling the\\ntwisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\\n“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughin g. “I am not quite\\nso bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was\\nnot much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up the steel\\npoker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\\n“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with th e official detective\\nforce! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only\\ntrust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing\\nthis brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and\\nafterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’ Commons, where I hope to get\\nsome data which may help us in this matter.”\\nIt was nearly one o’clock when Sherloc k Holmes returned from his\\nexcursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with\\nnotes and figures.\\n“I have seen the w ill of the deceased wife,” said he. “To determine its exact\\nmeaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the\\ninvestments with which it is con\\n253\\ncerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife’s death was little\\nshort of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not\\nmore than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an income of 250 pounds,\\nin case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married,\\nthis beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would\\ncripple him to a very serious extent. My morning’s work has not been\\nwasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for\\nstanding in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too\\nserious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are\\ninteresting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab\\nand drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your\\nrevolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument with\\ngentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are,\\nI think, all that we need.”\\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where\\nwe hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through\\nthe lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few\\nfleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just\\nthrowing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant\\nsmell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between\\nthe sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were\\nengaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat\\npulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the\\ndeepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder,\\nand pointed over the meadows.\\n“Look there!” said he.\\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a\\ngrove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey\\ngables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\\n“Stoke Moran?” said he.\\n“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the driver.\\n“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where w e\\nare going.”\\n“There’s th e village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some\\ndistance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll find it\\nshorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields. There it\\nis, where the lady is walking.”\\n“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading his eyes.\\n“Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”\\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap r attled back on its way to\\nLeatherhead.\\n“I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile, “that this fellow\\nshould think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business.\\nIt may stop his gossip. Good\\n255 afternoon, Miss Stoner. You s ee that we have been as good as our word.”\\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which\\nspoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she cried, shaking\\nhands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone\\nto town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.”\\n“We have had the pleasure of making the doctor’s acquaintance,” said\\nHolmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss\\nStoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\\n“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.” “So it appears.”\\n“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from\\nhim. What will he say when he returns?”\\n“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is some\\none more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lo ck\\nyourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take\\nyou away to your aunt’s at Harrow. Now, we must make the\\nbest use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms\\nwhich we are to examine.”\\nThe building was of grey, l ichen-blotched stone, with a high\\ncentral portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a cra b,\\nthrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows\\nwere broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof\\nwas partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better\\nrepair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds\\nin the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed\\nthat this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected\\nagainst the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there\\nwere no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked\\nslowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention\\nthe outsides of the win\\ndows.\\n“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to\\nsleep, the centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to t he\\nmain building to Dr. Roylott’s chamber?”\\n“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.” “Pending the\\nalterations, as I understand. By the way, there\\ndoes not seem to be any very pressing need fo r repairs at that\\nend wall.”\\n“There we re none. I believe that it was an excuse to move\\nme from my room.”\\n“Ah! that is suggesti ve. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the\\ncorridor from which these three rooms open.\\nThere are windows in it, of course?”\\n“Yes, but very small ones. Too narro w for anyone to pass\\nthrough.”\\n“As you b oth locked your doors at night, your rooms were\\nunapproachable from that side. Now, would you have th e kindness to go\\ninto your room and bar your shutters?”\\n257\\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the\\nopen window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but\\nwithout success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to\\nraise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid\\niron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!” said he, scratching his\\nchin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No\\none could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the\\ninside throws any light upon the matter.”\\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three\\nbedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we\\npassed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping,\\nand in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room,\\nwith a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old countryhouses.\\nA brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow whitecounterpaned\\nbed in another, and a dressingtable on the left-hand side of the\\nwindow. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the\\nfurniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The\\nboards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten\\noak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original\\nbuilding of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat\\nsilent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in\\nevery detail of the apartment.\\n“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing to a\\nthick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying\\nupon the pillow.\\n“It goes to the housekeeper’s room.”\\n“It looks newer than the other things? ”\\n“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.” “Your sister asked for it,\\nI suppose?”\\n“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get\\nwhat we wanted for ourselves.”\\n“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull\\nthere. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satis fy\\nmyself as to this floor.” He threw himself down upon his fa ce\\nwith his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and\\nforward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards .\\nThen he did the same with the wood-work with which the\\nchamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed a nd\\nspent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and\\ndown the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and\\ngave it a brisk tug.\\n“Why, it’s a dumm y,” said he.\\n“Won’t it ring?”\\n“No, it is not ev en attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see\\nnow that it is fastened to a hook just above\\nwhere the little opening for the ventilator is.”\\n“How very absurd! I never noticed that before .”\\n259\\n“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or two\\nvery singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder\\nmust be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same\\ntrouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”\\n“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.\\n“Done about the same time as the bell-rop e?” remarked\\nHolmes.\\n“Yes, the re were several little changes carried out about that\\ntime.”\\n“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—\\ndummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. W ith\\nyour permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researche s\\ninto the inner apartment.”\\nDr. Grimesby Roylott’s ch amber was larger than that of his\\nstep-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a\\nsmall wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technic al character, an\\narmchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against\\nthe wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the p rincipal\\nthings which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and\\nexamined each and all of them with the keenest interest. “W hat’s in here?”\\nhe asked, tapping the safe.\\n“My stepfather’s business papers.”\\n“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”\\n“Only once, some years ago. I rem ember that it was full of\\npapers.”\\n“There i sn’t a cat in it, for example?”\\n“No. What a strange idea!”\\n“Well, look at this!” He too k up a small saucer of milk which\\nstood on the top of it.\\n“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”\\n“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet\\na saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I\\ndaresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine. ”\\nHe squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined\\nthe seat of it with the greatest attention.\\n“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his lens in his\\npocket. “Hullo! Here is something interesting!”\\nThe object which had caught his eye was a smal l dog lash\\nhung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was cur led\\nupon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord. “Wha t do you make\\nof that, Watson?”\\n“It’s a common en ough lash. But I don’t know why it should\\nbe tied.”\\n“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked\\nworld, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it i s the\\nworst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner,\\nand with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn. ” I had never\\nseen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so\\ndark as it was when we turned from the scen e of this investiga\\n261\\ntion. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss\\nStoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused\\nhimself from his reverie.\\n“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should absolutely\\nfollow my advice in every respect.”\\n“I shall most certainly do so.”\\n“The matter is too serious fo r any hesitation. Your life may depend upon\\nyour compliance.”\\n“I assure you that I am in your hands.”\\n“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room.”\\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\\n“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over\\nthere?”\\n“Yes, th at is the Crown.”\\n“Very good. Your window s would be visible from there?”\\n“Certainly.”\\n“You must c onfine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when\\nyour stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night,\\nyou must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp\\nthere as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which\\nyou are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no\\ndoubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.”\\n“Oh, yes, easily.”\\n“The rest you wil l leave in our hands.”\\n“But what will you do?”\\n“We shall spend the nigh t in your room, and we shall investigate the cause\\nof this noise which has disturbed you.”\\n“I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,” said\\nMiss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.\\n“Perhaps I have.”\\n“Then, for pity’s s ake, tell me what was the cause of my sister’s death.”\\n“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”\\n“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is co rrect, and if she died\\nfrom some sudden fright.”\\n“No, I do not think so. I th ink that there was probably some more tangible\\ncause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned\\nand saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if\\nyou will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon\\ndrive away the dangers that threaten you.”\\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sittingroom\\nat the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window\\nwe could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of\\nStoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive\\npast, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove\\nhim. The boy had some slight difficulty in un\\n263\\ndoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor’s\\nvoice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The\\ntrap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up\\namong the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\\n“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering\\ndarkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a\\ndistinct element of danger.”\\n“Can I be of assistance?”\\n“Your presence might be invaluable.”\\n“Then I shall certainly come.”\\n“It is very kind of you.”\\n“You speak of danger. Y ou have evidently seen more in these\\nrooms than was visible to me.”\\n“No, but I fancy that I may hav e deduced a little more. I\\nimagine that you saw all that I did.”\\n“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what\\npurpose that could answer I confess is more than I can i magine.”\\n“You saw the ventilator, too?”\\n“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing\\nto have a small opening between two rooms. It was so sma ll\\nthat a rat could hardly pass through.”\\n“I knew that we should find a ventila tor before ever we\\ncame to Stoke Moran.”\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\n“Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said\\nthat her sister could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of co urse\\nthat suggested at once that there must be a communication\\nbetween the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it\\nwould have been remarked upon at the coroner’s inq uiry. I deduced a\\nventilator.”\\n“But what h arm can there be in that?”\\n“Well, there is at least a curious coinci dence of dates. A\\nventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the\\nbed dies. Does not that strike you?”\\n“I cannot as yet see any connection. ”\\n“Did you observe anything very pecu liar about that bed?” “No.”\\n“It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastene d like that\\nbefore?”\\n“I cannot say that I have.”\\n“The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the\\nsame relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—or s o\\nwe may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull .” “Holmes,” I\\ncried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time\\nto prevent some subtle and\\nhorrible crime.”\\n“Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does\\ngo wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has\\nknowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of\\ntheir profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think,\\n265\\nWatson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have\\nhorrors enough before the night is over; for goodness’ sake let us have a\\nquiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.”\\nAbout nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was\\ndark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away,\\nand then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone\\nout right in front of us.\\n“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes from the\\nmiddle window.”\\nAs we passed ou t he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining\\nthat we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was\\npossible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out\\non the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light\\ntwinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre\\nerrand.\\nThere w as little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches\\ngaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached\\nthe lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out\\nfrom a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and\\ndistorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and\\nthen ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\\n“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”\\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice\\nupon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his\\nlips to my ear.\\n“It is a nice ho usehold,” he murmured. “That is the baboon.”\\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected . There was a\\ncheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I\\nconfess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes’\\nexample and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My\\ncompanion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table,\\nand cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the\\ndaytime.Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he\\nwhispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to\\ndistinguish the words:\\n“The least sound woul d be fatal to our plans.”\\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\\n“We must sit without light. He wo uld see it through the ventilator.”\\nI nodded again.\\n“Do not go asl eep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol\\nready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in\\nthat chair.”\\nI took out m y revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he plac ed upon the bed\\nbeside him. By it he laid the box of matches and\\n267 the stump of a candle. Then h e turned down the lamp, and we were left in\\ndarkness.\\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not\\neven the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat openeyed,\\nwithin a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which\\nI was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in\\nabsolute darkness.\\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very\\nwindow a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was\\nindeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock,\\nwhich boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those\\nquarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting\\nsilently for whatever might befall.\\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of\\nthe ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong\\nsmell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a\\ndark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent\\nonce more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with\\nstraining ears.Then suddenly another sound became audible— a very\\ngentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually\\nfrom a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed,\\nstruck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.\\n“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”\\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holm es struck\\nthe light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my\\nweary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend\\nlashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and\\nfilled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at\\nthe ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the\\nmost horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and\\nlouder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one\\ndreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the\\ndistant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold\\nto our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last\\nechoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\\n“What can it mean?” I gasped.\\n“It means that it is all over,” H olmes answered. “And perhaps, after all, it is\\nfor the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott’s room.”\\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor . Twice\\nhe struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he\\nturned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my\\nhand.\\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern\\nwith the shutter half open, throwing a\\n269\\nbrilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside\\nthis table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey\\ndressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into\\nred heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the\\nlong lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked\\nupward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the\\nceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish\\nspeckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered\\nhe made neither sound nor motion.\\n“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.\\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and\\nthere reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and\\npuffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\\n“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He has\\ndied within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon\\nthe violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let\\nus thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss\\nStoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has\\nhappened.”\\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and\\nthrowing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid perch\\nand, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed\\nupon it.\\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke\\nMoran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has\\nalready run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to\\nthe terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of\\nher good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came\\nto the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with\\na dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me\\nby Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.\\n“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows,\\nmy dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient\\ndata. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word ‘band,’ which was\\nused by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had\\ncaught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put\\nme upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly\\nreconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that\\nwhatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either\\nfrom the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have\\nalready remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung\\ndown to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was\\nclamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was\\nthere as a bridge for some\\n271\\nthing passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake\\ninstantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the\\ndoctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was\\nprobably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could\\nnot possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as\\nwould occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training.\\nThe rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from\\nhis point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner,\\nindeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would\\nshow where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the\\nwhistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light\\nrevealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk\\nwhich we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through\\nthis ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it\\nwould crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite\\nthe occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner\\nor later she must fall a victim.\\n“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An\\ninspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing\\non it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the\\nventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of\\nwhipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have\\nremained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused\\nby her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible\\noccupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took\\nin order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no\\ndoubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.”\\n“With the result of driving it through the ventilator.” “And also with the\\nresult of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the\\nblows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew\\nupon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible\\nfor Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh\\nvery heavily upon my conscience.”\\n9.\\nThe Adventure of the Engineer’s Thumb.\\nOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock\\nHolmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two\\nwhich I was the means of introducing to his notice—that of Mr. Hatherley’s\\nthumb, and that of Colonel Warburton’s madness. Of these the latter may\\nhave afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other\\nwas so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be\\nthe more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend\\nfewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he\\nachieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told more\\nthan once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much\\nless striking when set forth en bloc in a single half\\n273\\ncolumn of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes,\\nand the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a\\nstep which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances\\nmade a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly\\nserved to weaken the effect.\\nIt was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the events\\noccurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil\\npractice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms,\\nalthough I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to\\nforgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had\\nsteadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from\\nPaddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of\\nthese, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never\\nweary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every\\nsufferer over whom he might have any influence.\\nOne morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the maid\\ntapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington\\nand were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by\\nexperience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs.\\nAs I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the\\ndoor tightly behind him.\\n“I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over\\n275\\nhis shoulder; “he’s all right.”\\n“What is it, then?” I asked, fo r his manner suggested that it\\nwas some strange creature which he had caged up in my r oom. “It’s a new\\npatient,” he whispered. “I thought I’d bring him\\nround myself; then he couldn’t slip away. There he is, all safe\\nand sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the\\nsame as you.” And off he went, this trusty tout, without even\\ngiving me time to thank him.\\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated\\nby the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather twee d\\nwith a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books.\\nRound one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which\\nwas mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more\\nthan five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine\\nface; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impressi on\\nof a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which\\nit took all his strength of mind to control.\\n“I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doc tor,” said he, “but\\nI have had a very serious accident during the night. I came i n\\nby train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to\\nwhere I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly es corted me here. I\\ngave the maid a card, but I see that she has\\nleft it upon the side-table.”\\nI took it up and glanced a t it. “Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer,\\n16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).” That was\\nthe name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. “I regret that I have kept\\nyou waiting,” said I, sitting down in my librarychair. “You are fresh from a\\nnight journey, I understand, which\\nis in itself a monotonous occupatio n.”\\n“Oh, my night could not be called mon otonous,” said he,\\nand laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringin g\\nnote, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my\\nmedical instincts rose up against that laugh.\\n“Stop it!” I cried; “pull yourself together!” a nd I poured out\\nsome water from a caraffe.\\nIt was useless, however. H e was off in one of those hysterical outbursts\\nwhich come upon a strong nature when some\\ngreat crisis is over and gone. Presently he cam e to himself once\\nmore, very weary and pale-looking.\\n“I have been making a fool of myse lf,” he gasped. “Not at all. Drink this.” I\\ndashed some brandy into the water,\\nand the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks. “That’s better!”\\nsaid he. “And now, Doctor, perhaps you\\nwould kindly attend to my thumb, or rat her to the place where\\nmy thumb used to be.”\\nHe unwound the handk erchief and held out his hand. It\\ngave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. T here\\nwere four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface\\nwhere the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or\\ntorn right out from the roots.\\n“Good heavens!” I cried, “th is is a terrible injury. It must\\nhave bled considerably.”\\n277\\n“Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been\\nsenseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding,\\nso I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced\\nit up with a twig.”\\n“Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.”\\n“It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province.”\\n“This has been done,” said I, examining the wound, “by a very heavy and\\nsharp instrument.”\\n“A thing like a clea ver,” said he.\\n“An accident, I presume?”\\n“By no means.”\\n“What! a murde rous attack?”\\n“Very murderous indeed.”\\n“You horrify me.”\\nI sponged the wou nd, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with\\ncotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing,\\nthough he bit his lip from time to time.\\n“How is that?” I asked when I had finis hed.\\n“Capital! Between your brandy and your ba ndage, I feel a new man. I was\\nvery weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.”\\n“Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to\\nyour nerves.”\\n“Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between\\nourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine,\\nI should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very\\nextraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to\\nback it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are\\nso vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.”\\n“Ha!” cried I, “if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire\\nto see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.”\\n“Oh, I have heard of that fellow,” answered my visit or, “and I should be\\nvery glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the\\nofficial police as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?”\\n“I’ll do better. I’ll take you round to him myself.”\\n“I should be immensely obliged to you.”\\n“We’ll call a cab and go together. We s hall just be in time to have a little\\nbreakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?”\\n“Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.”\\n“Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be wit h you in an instant.” I\\nrushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes\\nwas inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.\\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his\\ndressing-gown, reading the agony column\\n279\\nof The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed\\nof all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all\\ncarefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received\\nus in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined\\nus in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance\\nupon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy\\nand water within his reach.\\n“It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.\\nHatherley,” said he. “Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at\\nhome. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your\\nstrength with a little stimulant.”\\n“Thank you,” said my patient. “but I have felt another man since the doctor\\nbandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall\\ntake up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once\\nupon my peculiar experiences.”\\nHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression\\nwhich veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we\\nlistened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.\\n“You must know,” said he, “that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing\\nalone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I\\nhave had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I\\nwas apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of\\nGreenwich.Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come\\ninto a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I determined to\\nstart in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria\\nStreet.\\n“I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a\\ndreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I\\nhave had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all\\nthat my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to 27 pounds\\n10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I\\nwaited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to\\nbelieve that I should never have any practice at all.\\n“Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk\\nentered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon\\nbusiness. He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘Colonel Lysander\\nStark’ engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man\\nrather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that\\nI have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose\\nand chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his\\noutstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and\\ndue to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing\\nassured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge,\\n281\\nwould be nearer forty than thirty.\\n“‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he, with so mething of a German ac\\ncent. ‘You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as\\nbeing a man who is not only proficient in his profession but i s\\nalso discreet and capable of preserving a secret.’\\n“I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at\\nsuch an address. ‘May I ask who it was who gave me so g ood a\\ncharacter?’\\n“‘Well, perh aps it is better that I should not tell you that\\njust at this moment. I have it from the same source that y ou\\nare both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in\\nLondon.’\\n“‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but you will excuse me\\nif I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon m y professional\\nqualifications. I understand that it was on a professional\\nmatter that you wished to speak to me?’\\n“‘Undoubtedly so. But you will find tha t all I say is really to\\nthe point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is\\nquite essential—absolute secrecy, you understand,\\nand of course we may expect that more from a man who is\\nalone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.’ “‘If I promise to\\nkeep a secret,’ said I, ‘you may absolutely\\ndepend upon my doing so.’\\n“He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me\\nthat I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye. “‘Do you\\npromise, then?’ said he at last.\\n“‘Yes, I promise.’\\n“‘Absolute and co mplete silence before, during, and after?\\nNo reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing? ’ “‘I have already\\ngiven you my word.’\\n“‘Very good.’ He sud denly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the\\nroom he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\\n“‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back. ‘I know that clerks\\nare sometimes curious as to their master’s affairs. Now we c an\\ntalk in safety.’ He drew up his chair very close to mine and\\nbegan to stare at me again with the same questioning and\\nthoughtful look.\\n“A feeling of rep ulsion, and of something akin to fear had\\nbegun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshle ss\\nman. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me\\nfrom showing my impatience.\\n“‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said I; ‘my time\\nis of value.’ Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the\\nwords came to my lips.\\n“‘How would fifty guin eas for a night’s work suit you?’ he\\nasked.\\n“‘Mos t admirably.’\\n“‘I say a night’s wo rk, but an hour’s would be nearer the\\nmark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stam ping\\nmachine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is\\nwrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you th ink\\n283\\nof such a commission as that?’\\n“‘The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’ “‘Precisely so. We\\nshall want you to come to-night by the\\nlast train.’\\n“‘Where to ?’\\n“‘To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire,\\nand within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which\\nwould bring you there at about 11:15.’\\n“‘Very good.’\\n“‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’ “‘There is a drive, then?’\\n“‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good\\nseven miles from Eyford Station.’\\n“‘Then we can hardly get there be fore midnight. I suppose\\nthere would be no chance of a train back. I should be com pelled to stop the\\nnight.’\\n“‘Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.’ “‘That is very awkward.\\nCould I not come at some more\\nconvenient hour?’\\n“‘We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to\\nrecompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to\\nyou, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an\\nopinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of cou rse,\\nif you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of\\ntime to do so.’\\n“I thought of th e fifty guineas, and of how very useful they\\nwould be to me. ‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to\\naccommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to\\nunderstand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to\\ndo.’\\n“‘Qu ite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which\\nwe have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity .\\nI have no wish to commit you to anything without your hav ing it all laid\\nbefore you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe\\nfrom eavesdroppers?’\\n“‘Entirely.’\\n“‘Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that\\nfuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in\\none or two places in England?’\\n“‘I have heard so.’\\n“‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very small\\nplace—within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough\\nto discover that there was a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one o f\\nmy fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit\\nwas a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link betw een two very\\nmuch larger ones upon the right and left—\\nboth of them, however, in the grounds of m y neighbours.These\\ngood people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained\\nthat which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it\\nwas to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its\\ntrue value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could\\n285\\ndo this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they\\nsuggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit\\nand that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to\\nbuy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time,\\nand in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This\\npress, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your\\nadvice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if\\nit once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little\\nhouse, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would\\nbe good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our\\nplans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a\\nhuman being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all\\nplain?’\\n“‘I quite follow you,’ said I. ‘The only point which I could not quite\\nunderstand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating\\nfuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.’\\n“‘Ah!’ said he carelessly, ‘we have our own process. We compress the earth\\ninto bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that\\nis a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr.\\nHatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.’ He rose as he spoke. ‘I\\nshall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.’\\n“‘I shall certainly be there.’\\n“‘And not a word to a soul .’ He looked at me with a last long, questioning\\ngaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the\\nroom.\\n“Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much\\nastonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had\\nbeen intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was\\nat least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own\\nservices, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the\\nother hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant\\nimpression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the\\nfuller’s-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at\\nmidnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand.\\nHowever, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to\\nPaddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to\\nholding my tongue.\\n“At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However,\\nI was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit\\nstation after eleven o’clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and\\nthere was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a\\nlantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my\\nacquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side.\\nWithout a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door\\nof which was standing open. He\\n287\\ndrew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away\\nwe went as fast as the horse could go.”\\n“One horse?” interjected Holmes.\\n“Yes, only one.”\\n“Did you observ e the colour?”\\n“Yes, I saw it by the side-ligh ts when I was stepping into the carriage. It\\nwas a chestnut.”\\n“Tired-looking o r fresh?”\\n“Oh, fresh and glossy.”\\n“Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most\\ninteresting statement.”\\n“Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander\\nStark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate\\nthat we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have\\nbeen nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was\\naware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking\\nat me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in\\nthat part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out\\nof the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of\\nfrosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur\\nof a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the\\nmonotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables,\\nand the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the\\nroad was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the\\ncarriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I\\nfollowed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of\\nus. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that\\nI failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The\\ninstant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us,\\nand I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.\\n“It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about lo oking\\nfor matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the\\nother end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our\\ndirection. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand,\\nwhich she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.\\nI could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light\\nshone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a\\nfew words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and\\nwhen my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start\\nthat the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her,\\nwhispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room\\nfrom whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in\\nhis hand.\\n“‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few\\nminutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly\\nfurnished room, with a round table in the\\n289\\ncentre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid\\ndown the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep\\nyou waiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.\\n“I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of\\nGerman I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others\\nbeing volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I\\nmight catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily\\nbarred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was\\nan old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise\\neverything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal\\nover me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living\\nin this strange, outof-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten\\nmiles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east,\\nor west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large\\ntowns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after\\nall. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the\\ncountry. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to\\nkeep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fiftyguinea\\nfee.\\n“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness,\\nthe door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the\\naperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp\\nbeating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she\\nwas sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up\\none shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered\\nwords of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a\\nfrightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\\n“‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; ‘I\\nwould go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.’\\n“‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for.\\nI cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’ “‘It is not worth your\\nwhile to wait,’ she went on. ‘You can\\npass through the door; no one hinders .’ And then, seeing that\\nI smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her\\nconstraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung\\ntogether. ‘For the love of Heaven!’ she whispered, ‘get aw ay\\nfrom here before it is too late!’\\n“But I am somewhat headstron g by nature, and the more\\nready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the\\nway. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journ ey, and of the\\nunpleasant night which seemed to be before\\nme. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away\\nwithout having carried out my commission, and without th e\\npayment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew,\\nbe a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her\\n291\\nmanner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head\\nand declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to\\nrenew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of\\nseveral footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant,\\nthrew up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and\\nas noiselessly as she had come.\\n“The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a\\nchinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was\\nintroduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\\n“‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel. ‘By the way, I was\\nunder the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have\\nfelt the draught.’\\n“‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door myself because I felt the room\\nto be a little close.’\\n“He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘Perhaps we had better proceed\\nto business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the\\nmachine.’\\n“‘I had be tter put my hat on, I suppose.’\\n“‘Oh, no, it is in the house.’\\n“‘What, you dig fuller’s-ear th in the house?’\\n“‘No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we\\nwish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong\\nwith it.’\\n“We we nt upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager\\nand I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors,\\npassages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of\\nwhich were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There\\nwere no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while\\nthe plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in\\ngreen, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as\\npossible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I\\ndisregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions.\\nFerguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the\\nlittle that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.\\n“Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he\\nunlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could\\nhardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered\\nme in.\\n“‘We a re now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be\\na particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The\\nceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and\\nit comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are\\nsmall lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which\\ntransmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The\\nmachine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of\\nit, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to\\nlook it over and to show us how we can set it right.’\\n293\\n“I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It\\nwas indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure.\\nWhen I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which\\ncontrolled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight\\nleakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side\\ncylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which\\nwas round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the\\nsocket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of\\npower, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks\\nvery carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should\\nproceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the\\nmain chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own\\ncuriosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was\\nthe merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an\\nengine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of\\nwood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to\\nexamine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped\\nand was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered\\nexclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking\\ndown at me.\\n“‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.\\n“I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he\\nhad told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’searth,’ said I; ‘I think that I should\\nbe better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact\\npurpose was for which it was used.’\\n“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech.\\nHis face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\\n“‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’ He took a\\nstep backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I\\nrushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did\\nnot give in the least to my kicks and shoves. ‘Hullo!’ I yelled. ‘Hullo!\\nColonel! Let me out!’\\n“And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into\\nmy mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking\\ncylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor\\nwhere I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the\\nblack ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew\\nbetter than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a\\nshapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged\\nwith my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the\\nremorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only\\na foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its\\nhard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that\\n295\\nthe pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I\\nmet it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I\\nshuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and\\nyet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering\\ndown upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught\\nsomething which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\\n“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of\\nwood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow\\nlight between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small\\npanel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here\\nwas indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw\\nmyself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had\\nclosed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments\\nafterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had\\nbeen my escape.\\n“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found\\nmyself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent\\nover me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her\\nright. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly\\nrejected.\\n“‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They will be here in a moment.\\nThey will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time,\\nbut come!’\\n“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and\\nran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to\\nanother broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of\\nrunning feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from\\nthe floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped\\nand looked about her like one who is at her wit’s end. Then she threw open\\na door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon\\nwas shining brightly.\\n“‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high, but it may be that you can\\njump it.’\\n“As she s poke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and\\nI saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a\\nlantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s cleaver in the other. I\\nrushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How\\nquiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it\\ncould not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I\\nhesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour\\nand the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was\\ndetermined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed\\nthrough my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but\\nshe threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\\n“‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember your prom\\n297 ise after the last time. You sai d it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh,\\nhe will be silent!’\\n“‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her. ‘You\\nwill be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!’ He dashed\\nher to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy\\nweapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when\\nhis blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell\\ninto the garden below.\\n“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off\\namong the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far\\nfrom being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly\\ndizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which\\nwas throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had\\nbeen cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured\\nto tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my\\nears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.\\n“How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very\\nlong time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when\\nI came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve\\nwas drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it\\nrecalled in an instant all the particulars of my night’s adventure, and I\\nsprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my\\npursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither\\nhouse nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge\\nclose by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building,\\nwhich proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had\\narrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my\\nhand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an\\nevil dream.\\n“Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.\\nThere would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was\\non duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him\\nwhether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was\\nstrange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me?\\nNo, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one\\nabout three miles off.\\n“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until\\nI got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past\\nsix when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the\\ndoctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your\\nhands and shall do exactly what you advise.”\\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this\\nextraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf\\none of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.\\n299\\n“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he. “It appeared in\\nall the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: ‘Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr.\\nJeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings\\nat ten o’clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,’\\netc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have\\nhis machine overhauled, I fancy.”\\n“Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that explains what the girl said.”\\n“Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperat e\\nman, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way\\nof his little game, like those outand-out pirates who will leave no survivor\\nfrom a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel\\nequal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to\\nstarting for Eyford.”\\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound\\nfrom Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes,\\nthe hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plainclothes\\nman, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the\\ncounty out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle\\nwith Eyford for its centre.\\n“There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from\\nthe village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said\\nten miles, I think, sir.” “It was an hour’s good drive.”\\n“And you think that they brought you back all tha t way when you were\\nunconscious?”\\n“They must ha ve done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been\\nlifted and conveyed somewhere.”\\n“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have spared you\\nwhen they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was\\nsoftened by the woman’s entreaties.”\\n“I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life.”\\n“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet. “Well, I have draw n\\nmy circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are\\nin search of are to be found.”\\n“I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes quietly.\\n“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed yo ur opinion! Come,\\nnow, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is\\nmore deserted there.”\\n“And I say east,” said my patient.\\n“I am for west,” remarked the pl ain-clothes man. “There are several quiet\\nlittle villages up there.”\\n“And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hills there, and our\\nfriend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.”\\n“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very p retty diversity of\\nopinion. We have boxed the compass among us.\\n301\\nWho do you give your casting vote to?”\\n“You are all wrong.”\\n“But we can’t all be.”\\n“Oh, yes, you can. Th is is my point.” He placed his finger\\nin the centre of the circle. “This is where we shall find them.” “But the\\ntwelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley. “Six out and six back. Nothing\\nsimpler. You say yourself\\nthat the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if\\nit had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?” “Indeed, it is a likely ruse\\nenough,” observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. “Of course there can be no\\ndoubt as to the nature of this gang.”\\n“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large scale, and have\\nused the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.”\\n“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the\\ninspector. “They have been turning out halfcrowns by the thousand. We\\neven traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had\\ncovered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But\\nnow, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right\\nenough.”\\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall\\ninto the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic\\ncolumn of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in\\nthe neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the\\nlandscape.\\n“A house on fire?” asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its\\nway.\\n“Yes , sir!” said the station-master.\\n“When did it break out?”\\n“I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole\\nplace is in a blaze.”\\n“Whose house is it? ”\\n“Dr. Becher’s.”\\n“Tell me,” brok e in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a\\nlong, sharp nose?”\\nThe station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman,\\nand there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he\\nhas a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a\\nforeigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no\\nharm.”\\nThe sta tion-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening\\nin the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great\\nwidespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every\\nchink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were\\nvainly striving to keep the flames under.\\n“That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. “There is the graveldrive,\\nand there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the\\none that I jumped from.”\\n303\\n“Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge upon them.\\nThere can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was\\ncrushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they\\nwere too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep\\nyour eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very\\nmuch fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.”\\nAnd Holmes’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word\\nhas ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or\\nthe morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart\\ncontaining several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the\\ndirection of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and\\neven Holmes’ ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their\\nwhereabouts.\\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which\\nthey had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed\\nhuman thumb upon a windowsill of the second floor. About sunset,\\nhowever, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames,\\nbut not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to\\nsuch absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a\\ntrace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate\\nacquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered\\nstored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have\\nexplained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already\\nreferred to.\\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot\\nwhere he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were\\nit not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently\\nbeen carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet\\nand the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that\\nthe silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his\\ncompanion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the\\nway of danger.\\n“Well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more\\nto London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I\\nhave lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”\\n“Experience,” said Holmes, laughing. “Indirectly it may be of value, you\\nknow; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being\\nexcellent company for the remainder of your existence.”\\n10.\\nThe Adventure of the Noble Bachelor.\\nThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased\\nto be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate\\nbridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant\\ndetails have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I\\nhave reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed\\nto the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable\\nshare in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be\\ncomplete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.\\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was\\nstill sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an\\nafternoon stroll to find a\\n305\\nletter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the\\nweather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the\\nJezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my\\nAfghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one\\neasychair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud\\nof newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them\\nall aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the\\nenvelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble\\ncorrespondent could be.\\n“Here is a very fashionable epistle,” I remarked as he entered. “Your\\nmorning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tidewaiter.”\\n“Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” he answered,\\nsmiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like\\none of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to\\nbe bored or to lie.”\\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\\n“Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.”\\n“Not social, then?”\\n“No, distinctly prof essional.”\\n“And from a noble client?”\\n“One of the highest in Engl and.”\\n307\\n“My dear fellow, I congratulate you.”\\n“I assure you, Watson, without affect ation, that the status of my client is a\\nmatter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible,\\nhowever, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You\\nhave been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?”\\n“It looks like it,” said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. “I\\nhave had nothing else to do.”\\n“It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing\\nexcept the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always\\ninstructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have\\nread about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?”\\n“Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.”\\n“That is well. The letter which I hol d in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I\\nwill read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me\\nhave whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:\\n“‘MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:—Lord Backw ater tells me that\\nI may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have\\ndetermined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to\\nthe very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding.\\nMr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he\\nassures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even\\nthinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o’clock in the\\nafternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope\\nthat you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours\\nfaithfully, ST. SIMON.’\\n“It is dated from Grosv enor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the\\nnoble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side\\nof his right little finger,” remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.\\n“He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.”\\n“Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon th e subject.\\nTurn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while\\nI take a glance as to who our client is.” He picked a red-covered volume\\nfrom a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. “Here he is,” said\\nhe, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. “‘Lord Robert\\nWalsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.’\\nHum! ‘Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.’\\nHe’s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was UnderSecretary\\nfor the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was\\nat one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by\\ndirect descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very\\ninstructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something\\nmore solid.”\\n“I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,” said I,\\n309\\n“for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I\\nfeared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on\\nhand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.”\\n“Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.\\nThat is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the first.\\nPray give me the results of your newspaper selections.”\\n“Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the\\nMorning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: ‘A marriage has\\nbeen arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take\\nplace, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral,\\nand Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San\\nFrancisco, Cal., U.S.A.’ That is all.”\\n“Terse and to the point,” remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs\\ntowards the fire.\\n“There was a pa ragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the\\nsame week. Ah, here it is: ‘There will soon be a call for protection in the\\nmarriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily\\nagainst our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses\\nof Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the\\nAtlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the\\nlist of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders.\\nLord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against\\nthe little god’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching\\nmarriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California\\nmillionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted\\nmuch attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is\\ncurrently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six\\nfigures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the\\nDuke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few\\nyears, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small\\nestate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only\\ngainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common\\ntransition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.’”\\n“Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning.\\n“Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another not e in the Morning Post to say that\\nthe marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St.\\nGeorge’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be\\ninvited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster\\nGate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later—that is,\\non Wednesday last—there is a curt announcement that the wedding had\\ntaken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater’s\\nplace, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the\\ndisappearance of the bride.”\\n311\\n“Before the what?” asked Holmes with a start. “The vanishing of the lady.”\\n“When did she vanish, then?”\\n“At the wedding breakfast.”\\n“Indeed. This is more interes ting than it promised to be;\\nquite dramatic, in fact.”\\n“Yes; it struck me as be ing a little out of the common.” “They often vanish\\nbefore the ceremony, and occasionally\\nduring the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt\\nas this. Pray let me have the details.” “I warn you that they are very\\nincomplete.”\\n“Perhaps we may make them less so.”\\n“Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of\\nyesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, ‘Singular Occurrence at a\\nFashionable Wedding’:\\n“‘The family of Lord R obert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest\\nconsternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in\\nconnection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the\\npapers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now\\nthat it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so\\npersistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the\\nmatter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good\\npurpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject\\nfor conversation.\\n“‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s, Hanover Square,\\nwas a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr.\\nAloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace\\nand Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the\\nbridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded\\nafterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where\\nbreakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused\\nby a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to\\nforce her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had\\nsome claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged\\nscene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who\\nhad fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had\\nsat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden\\nindisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused\\nsome comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she\\nhad only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and\\nbonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that\\nhe had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit\\nthat it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On\\nascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in\\nconjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in\\ncommunication with the police, and very energetic inquiries\\n313\\nare being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this\\nvery singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had\\ntranspired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of\\nfoul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of\\nthe woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from\\njealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange\\ndisappearance of the bride.’”\\n“And is that all?”\\n“Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive\\none.”\\n“And it is—”\\n“That Miss F lora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has\\nactually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the\\nAllegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are\\nno further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now—so far as it\\nhas been set forth in the public press.”\\n“And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have\\nmissed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock\\nmakes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be\\nour noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer\\nhaving a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.”\\n“Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throw ing open the door.\\nA gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale,\\nwith something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady,\\nwell-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command\\nand to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance\\ngave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a\\nlittle bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very\\ncurly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As\\nto his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar,\\nblack frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and\\nlight-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head\\nfrom left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his\\ngolden eyeglasses. “Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising and\\nbowing. “Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr.\\nWatson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”\\n“A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine , Mr.\\nHolmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already\\nmanaged several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they\\nwere hardly from the same class of society.”\\n“No, I am descending.”\\n“I beg pardon.”\\n“My last client of the sort was a king.”\\n“Oh, really! I had no idea. And which k ing?”\\n315\\n“The King of Scandinavia.”\\n“What! Had he lost his wife ?”\\n“You can understand,” said Ho lmes suavely, “that I extend\\nto the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in\\nyours.”\\n“Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my own\\ncase, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in\\nforming an opinion.”\\n“Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing\\nmore. I presume that I may take it as correct— this article, for example, as\\nto the disappearance of the bride.”\\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.”\\n“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an\\nopinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning\\nyou.”\\n“Pray do so.”\\n“When did yo u first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”\\n“In San Francisco, a year ago.”\\n“You were travelling in the Stat es?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Did y ou become engaged then?”\\n“No.”\\n“But y ou were on a friendly footing?”\\n“I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”\\n“Her father is very rich?”\\n“He is said to be the rich est man on the Pacific slope.” “And how did he\\nmake his money?”\\n“In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested\\nit, and came up by leaps and bounds.”\\n“Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s— your wife’s\\ncharacter?”\\nThe noblem an swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire.\\n“You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before her father\\nbecame a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and\\nwandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come\\nfrom Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in\\nEngland a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any\\nsort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say. She is\\nswift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On\\nthe other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the\\nhonour to bear”—he gave a little stately cough—”had not I thought her to\\nbe at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic selfsacrifice\\nand that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.”\\n“Have you her photograph?”\\n“I brought this with me.” He opened a locket and showed us the full face of\\na very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and\\nthe artist had brought out\\n317\\nthe full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the\\nexquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the\\nlocket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\\n“The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your\\nacquaintance?”\\n“Yes, her fathe r brought her over for this last London season. I met her\\nseveral times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.”\\n“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”\\n“A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.”\\n“And this, of course, remains to you, since the marria ge is a fait accompli?”\\n“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”\\n“Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Dora n on the day before the\\nwedding?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Was s he in good spirits?”\\n“Never better. She kept talk ing of what we should do in our future lives.”\\n“Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?”\\n“She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony.”\\n“And did you observe any change in her then?”\\n“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her\\ntemper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate\\nand can have no possible bearing upon the case.”\\n“Pray let us have it, for all that.”\\n“Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry.\\nShe was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew.\\nThere was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to\\nher again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I\\nspoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage,\\non our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.”\\n“Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the\\ngeneral public were present, then?”\\n“Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.”\\n“This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”\\n“No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a commonlooking\\nperson. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we\\nare wandering rather far from the point.”\\n“Lady St. Simon, then, returned from th e wedding in a less cheerful frame\\nof mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father’s\\nhouse?”\\n“I saw h er in conversation with her maid.”\\n“And who is her maid?”\\n319 “Alice is her name. She is an American and came from\\nCalifornia with her.”\\n“A confidential serva nt?”\\n“A little too much so. It se emed to me that her mistress\\nallowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look\\nupon these things in a different way.”\\n“How long did she speak to this Alice ?”\\n“Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.” “You did not\\noverhear what they said?”\\n“Lady St. Simon said som ething about ‘jumping a claim.’\\nShe was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she\\nmeant.”\\n“American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do\\nwhen she finished speaking to her maid?”\\n“She walked into the breakfast-room.”\\n“On your arm?”\\n“No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after\\nwe had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some\\nwords of apology, and left the room. She never came back.”\\n“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she we nt to her room,\\ncovered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.”\\n“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in\\ncompany with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had\\nalready made a disturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.”\\n“Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lad y, and your\\nrelations to her.”\\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We have\\nbeen on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a very friendly\\nfooting. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously,\\nand she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what\\nwomen are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly\\nhotheaded and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters\\nwhen she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the\\nreason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest\\nthere might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran’s door just\\nafter we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very\\nabusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had\\nforeseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police\\nfellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was\\nquiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.”\\n“Did your wife hear all this?”\\n“No, thank goodness, she did not.”\\n“And she was seen walking with th is very woman afterwards?”\\n“Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon a s so serious.\\nIt is thought that Flora decoyed my wife\\n321\\nout and laid some terrible trap for her.”\\n“Well, it is a possible supposition.”\\n“You think so, too?”\\n“I did not say a prob able one. But you do not yourself look\\nupon this as likely?”\\n“I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”\\n“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray\\nwhat is your own theory as to what took place?”\\n“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to prop ound one.\\nI have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may\\nsay that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement\\nof this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immens e\\na social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous\\ndisturbance in my wife.”\\n“In short, that she had b ecome suddenly deranged?” “Well, really, when I\\nconsider that she has turned her back—\\nI will not say upon me, but upon so muc h that many have\\naspired to without success—I can hardly explain it in any other\\nfashion.”\\n“Well, ce rtainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said\\nHolmes, smiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I\\nhave nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seate d at\\nthe breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?” “ We could see\\nthe other side of the road and the Park.” “Quite so. Then I do not think that I\\nneed to detain you\\nlonger. I shall com municate with you.”\\n“Should you be fortunate enough to sol ve this problem,”\\nsaid our client, rising.\\n“I have solved it.”\\n“Eh? What was tha t?”\\n“I say that I have solve d it.”\\n“Where, then, is my wife?”\\n“That is a detail which I sh all speedily supply.” Lord St. Simon shook his\\nhead. “I am afraid that it will\\ntake wiser heads than yours o r mine,” he remarked, and bowing in a stately,\\nold-fashioned manner he departed. “It is very good of Lord St. Simon to\\nhonour my head by\\nputting it on a level with his own,” said Sherlock Holmes,\\nlaughing. “I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a\\ncigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conc lusions as to the\\ncase before our client came into the room.” “My dear Holmes!”\\n“I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I\\nremarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination\\nserved to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is\\noccasionally very convincing, as when\\nyou find a trout in the milk, to quote Th oreau’s example.” “But I have heard\\nall that you have heard.”\\n“Without, however, the k nowledge of pre-existing cases\\nwhich serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some\\nyears back, and something on very much the same\\nlines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is\\n323\\none of these cases—but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade!\\nYou will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in\\nthe box.”\\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him\\na decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his\\nhand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had\\nbeen offered to him.\\n“What’s up, then?” asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. “You look\\ndissatisfied.”\\n“And I feel d issatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can\\nmake neither head nor tail of the business.”\\n“Really! You surprise me.”\\n“Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through\\nmy fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.”\\n“And very wet it seems to have made you,” sa id Holmes laying his hand\\nupon the arm of the pea-jacket.\\n“Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.”\\n“In heaven’s name, what for?”\\n“In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.”\\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair a nd laughed heartily.\\n“Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?” he asked.\\n“Why? What do you mean?”\\n“Because you have just as go od a chance of finding this lady in the one as\\nin the other.”\\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. “I suppose you know all\\nabout it,” he snarled.\\n“Well, I have only ju st heard the facts, but my mind is made up.”\\n“Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no p art in the\\nmatter?”\\n“I think i t very unlikely.”\\n“Then perhaps you will k indly explain how it is that we found this in it?”\\nHe opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress\\nof watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride’s wreath and veil, all\\ndiscoloured and soaked in water. “There,” said he, putting a new weddingring\\nupon the top of the pile. “There is a little nut for you to crack, Master\\nHolmes.”\\n“Oh, inde ed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. “You dragged\\nthem from the Serpentine?”\\n“No. They were found float ing near the margin by a parkkeeper. They have\\nbeen identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were\\nthere the body would not be far off.”\\n“By the same brilliant reasoning, ev ery man’s body is to be found in the\\nneighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at\\nthrough this?”\\n“At some evid ence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.”\\n325\\n“I am afraid that you will find it difficult.”\\n“Are you, indeed, now?” cried Lestrade w ith some bitterness. “I am afraid,\\nHolmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your\\ninferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress\\ndoes implicate Miss Flora Millar.”\\n“And how?”\\n“In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a\\nnote. And here is the very note.” He slapped it down upon the table in front\\nof him. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when all is ready. Come at once.\\nF.H.M.’ Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was\\ndecoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt,\\nwas responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the\\nvery note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and\\nwhich lured her within their reach.”\\n“Very good, Lestrade,” said Holm es, laughing. “You really are very fine\\nindeed. Let me see it.” He took up the paper in a listless way, but his\\nattention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction.\\n“This is indeed important,” said he.\\n“Ha! you find it so?”\\n“Extremely so. I cong ratulate you warmly.”\\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his he ad to look. “Why,” he shrieked,\\n“you’re looking at the wrong side!”\\n“On the contrary, this is the right sid e.”\\n“The right side? You’re mad! Here is th e note written in pencil over here.”\\n“And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, whic h\\ninterests me deeply.”\\n“There’s nothing in it. I looked at it before,” said Lestrade. “‘Oct. 4th,\\nrooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.’ I\\nsee nothing in that.”\\n“Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is\\nimportant also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.”\\n“I’ve wasted time enough,” said Lestrade, rising. “I believe in hard work\\nand not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes,\\nand we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.” He gathered\\nup the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.\\n“Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes before his riva l vanished;\\n“I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth.\\nThere is not, and there never has been, any such person.”\\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his\\nforehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his\\novercoat. “There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,”\\nhe remarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a\\nlittle.”\\n327\\nIt was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time\\nto be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s man with a\\nvery large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had\\nbrought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite\\nepicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble\\nlodginghouse mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a\\npheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby\\nbottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away,\\nlike the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the\\nthings had been paid for and were ordered to this address.\\nJust before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.\\nHis features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made\\nme think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\\n“They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands. “You seem to\\nexpect company. They have laid for five.” “Yes, I fancy we may have some\\ncompany dropping in,”\\nsaid he. “I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I\\nfancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.” It was indeed our visitor of\\nthe afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously\\nthan ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic\\nfeatures. “My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.\\n“Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you\\ngood authority for what you say?” “The best possible.”\\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand ov er\\nhis forehead.\\n“What will th e Duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears\\nthat one of the family has been subjected to such humiliat ion?”\\n“It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any\\nhumiliation.”\\n“Ah, you loo k on these things from another standpoint.” “I fail to see that\\nanyone is to blame. I can hardly see how\\nthe lady could have acted otherwise, thou gh her abrupt method\\nof doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother,\\nshe had no one to advise her at such a crisis.”\\n“It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon,\\ntapping his fingers upon the table.\\n“You must make allowance for thi s poor girl, placed in so\\nunprecedented a position.”\\n“I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I\\nhave been shamefully used.”\\n“I think that I heard a ring,” s aid Holmes. “Yes, there are\\nsteps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a le nient\\nview of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advoc ate here who\\nmay be more successful.” He opened the door\\nand ushered in a lady and gentleman. “Lord St . Simon,” said\\nhe “allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay\\n329 Moulton. The lady, I think, yo u have already met.”\\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and\\nstood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast\\nof his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick\\nstep forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise\\nhis eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was\\none which it was hard to resist.\\n“You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess you have every cause to\\nbe.”\\n“Pra y make no apology to me,” said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\\n“Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and tha t I should have\\nspoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time\\nwhen I saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was doing or saying.\\nI only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.”\\n“Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave th e\\nroom while you explain this matter?”\\n“If I may give an opinion,” remarke d the strange gentleman, “we’ve had\\njust a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I\\nshould like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.” He was a small,\\nwiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.\\n“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady. “Frank here and I met in\\n’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where pa was working a claim.\\nWe were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck\\na rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that\\npetered out and came to nothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank;\\nso at last pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he\\ntook me away to ‘Frisco. Frank wouldn’t throw up his hand, though; so he\\nfollowed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it. It\\nwould only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for\\nourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never\\ncome back to claim me until he had as much as pa. So then I promised to\\nwait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else\\nwhile he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be married right away, then,’ said he,\\n‘and then I will feel sure of you; and I won’t claim to be your husband until\\nI come back?’ Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely,\\nwith a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and\\nthen Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa.\\n“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went\\nprospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After\\nthat came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been\\nattacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the\\nkilled. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought\\nI had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ‘Frisco. Not a\\n331\\nword of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank\\nwas really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to ‘Frisco, and we came to\\nLondon, and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt all\\nthe time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that\\nhad been given to my poor Frank.\\n“Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my duty by\\nhim. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar\\nwith him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me\\nto be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar\\nrails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the\\nfirst pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he\\nwas still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were\\nglad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was\\nturning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a\\nbee in my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make\\na scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what\\nI was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then\\nI saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a\\nnote. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to\\nhim, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers.\\nIt was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do\\nso. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to\\nhim, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.\\n“When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and\\nhad always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few\\nthings packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord\\nSt. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great\\npeople. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I\\nhadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at\\nthe other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into\\nthe Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman\\ncame talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me—seemed to\\nme from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before\\nmarriage also—but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook\\nFrank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he\\nhad taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those\\nyears of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had\\nescaped, came on to ‘Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had\\ngone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the\\nvery morning of my second wedding.”\\n“I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It gave the name and the\\nchurch but not where the lady lived.”\\n“Then we had a talk as to what w e should do, and Frank was all for\\nopenness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as\\n333\\nif I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again— just\\nsending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to\\nme to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table\\nand waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and\\nthings and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and\\ndropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely\\nthat we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good\\ngentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he\\nfound us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly\\nthat I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting\\nourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a\\nchance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away\\nround to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am\\nvery sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very\\nmeanly of me.”\\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened\\nwith a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.\\n“Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate\\npersonal affairs in this public manner.”\\n“Then you won’t forgive me? You won ’t shake hands before I go?”\\n“Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” He put out his h and and\\ncoldly grasped that which she extended to him.\\n“I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you would have joined us in a\\nfriendly supper.”\\n“I think that ther e you ask a little too much,” responded his Lordship. “I\\nmay be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly\\nbe expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I\\nwill now wish you all a very good-night.” He included us all in a sweeping\\nbow and stalked out of the room.\\n“Then I trust that you at least w ill honour me with your company,” said\\nSherlock Holmes. “It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for\\nI am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the\\nblundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from\\nbeing some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which\\nshall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.”\\n“The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes when ou r visitors\\nhad left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how simple the\\nexplanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost\\ninexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as\\nnarrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for\\ninstance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.”\\n“You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”\\n“From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one\\n335\\nthat the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the\\nother that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.\\nObviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to\\nchange her mind. What could that something be? She could not have\\nspoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the\\nbridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone\\nfrom America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she\\ncould hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her\\nthat the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so\\ncompletely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at\\nthe idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this\\nAmerican be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It\\nmight be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I\\nknew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had\\ngot before I ever heard Lord St. Simon’s narrative. When he told us of a\\nman in a pew, of the change in the bride’s manner, of so transparent a\\ndevice for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her\\nconfidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—\\nwhich in miners’ parlance means taking possession of that which another\\nperson has a prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear.\\nShe had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a\\nprevious husband—the chances being in favour of the latter.”\\n“And how in the world did you find them?”\\n“It might have been difficult, but friend L estrade held information in his\\nhands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of\\ncourse, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know\\nthat within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London\\nhotels.”\\n“How d id you deduce the select?”\\n“By the select prices. Eight shillin gs for a bed and eightpence for a glass of\\nsherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in\\nLondon which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in\\nNorthumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis\\nH. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on\\nlooking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I\\nhad seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226\\nGordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the\\nloving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to\\npoint out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make\\ntheir position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St.\\nSimon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I\\nmade him keep the appointment.”\\n“But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His conduct was certainly not\\nvery gracious.”\\n“Ah, Watson,” s aid Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would\\n337\\nnot be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding,\\nyou found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that\\nwe may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we\\nare never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up\\nand hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how\\nto while away these bleak autumnal evenings.”\\n11.\\nThe Adventure of the Beryl Coronet.\\n“Holmes,” said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down\\nthe street, “here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his\\nrelatives should allow him to come out alone.”\\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the\\npockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright,\\ncrisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon\\nthe ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of\\nBaker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic,\\nbut at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as\\nwhite as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but\\nwas still dangerously slip\\n339\\npery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the\\ndirection of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single\\ngentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive,\\nstrongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a\\nsombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters,\\nand well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to\\nthe dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with\\noccasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed\\nto set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down,\\nwaggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary\\ncontortions.\\n“What on earth can be the matter with him?” I asked. “He is looking up at\\nthe numbers of the houses.”\\n“I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\\n“Here?”\\n“Yes; I r ather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I\\nrecognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?” As he spoke, the man,\\npuffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the\\nwhole house resounded with the clanging.\\nA few moments later he was in our room , still puffing, still gesticulating,\\nbut with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were\\nturned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his\\nwords out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has\\nbeen driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to\\nhis feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both\\nrushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock\\nHolmes pushed him down into the easychair and, sitting beside him, patted\\nhis hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so\\nwell how to employ.\\n“You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?” said he. “You are\\nfatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and\\nthen I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may\\nsubmit to me.”\\nThe man sat fo r a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his\\nemotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight,\\nand turned his face towards us.\\n“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.\\n“I see that you have had some great trou ble,” responded Holmes.\\n“God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so\\nsudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I\\nam a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction\\nalso is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful\\na form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I\\n341 alone. The very noblest in th e land may suffer unless some way be found\\nout of this horrible affair.”\\n“Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have a clear account\\nof who you are and what it is that has befallen you.”\\n“My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to your ears. I am\\nAlexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of\\nThreadneedle Street.”\\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in\\nthe second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What\\ncould have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London\\nto this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort\\nhe braced himself to tell his story.\\n“I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I hastened here when the\\npolice inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to\\nBaker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the\\ncabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I\\nam a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the\\nfacts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\\n“It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as\\nmuch depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our\\nfunds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our\\ndepositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the\\nshape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good\\ndeal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble\\nfamilies to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their\\npictures, libraries, or plate.\\n“Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was\\nbrought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it\\nwas that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I had better say no\\nmore than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth—\\none of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was\\noverwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but\\nhe plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry\\nquickly through a disagreeable task.\\n“‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed that you are in the habit of\\nadvancing money.’\\n“‘The firm does so when the security is good.’ I answered.\\n“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I sho uld have 50,000\\npounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over\\nfrom my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to\\ncarry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand\\nthat it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’\\n“‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I a sked.\\n“‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most\\ncertainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right\\nto charge. But it is very essential to\\n343\\nme that the money should be paid at once.’\\n“‘I should be happy to advance it without fu rther parley\\nfrom my own private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain\\nwould be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand,\\nI am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my\\npartner I must insist that, even in your case, every busines slike\\nprecaution should be taken.’\\n“‘I should much prefer to ha ve it so,’ said he, raising up a\\nsquare, black morocco case which he had laid beside his c hair.\\n‘You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’ “‘One of the most\\nprecious public possessions of the empire,’ said I.\\n“‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbed ded in\\nsoft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery\\nwhich he had named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’\\nsaid he, ‘and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The\\nlowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double\\nthe sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with yo u\\nas my security.’\\n“I took the preci ous case into my hands and looked in some\\nperplexity from it to my illustrious client.\\n“‘You doubt its value?’ he asked.\\n“‘Not at all. I only doubt—’\\n“‘The propriety of my leavin g it. You may set your mind at\\nrest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not\\nabsolutely certain that I should be able in four days to recl aim\\nit. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?’ “‘Am ple.’\\n“‘You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong\\nproof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon a ll\\nthat I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discree t\\nand to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to\\npreserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I\\nneed not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any\\nharm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as\\nserious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the w orld\\nto match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I\\nleave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shal l\\ncall for it in person on Monday morning.’\\n“Seeing that my client was anxious to leav e, I said no more\\nbut, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1 000\\npound notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the\\nprecious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not\\nbut think with some misgivings of the immense responsibilit y\\nwhich it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it\\nwas a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if\\nany misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having\\never consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to\\nalter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and\\nturned once more to my work.\\n“When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence\\nto leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Banke rs’\\n345\\nsafes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how\\nterrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined,\\ntherefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case\\nbackward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my\\nreach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at\\nStreatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had\\ntaken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressingroom.\\n“And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to\\nthoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of\\nthe house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who\\nhave been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite\\nabove suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only\\nbeen in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character,\\nhowever, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and\\nhas attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is\\nthe only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a\\nthoroughly good girl in every way.\\n“So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take\\nme long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has\\nbeen a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous disappointment. I\\nhave no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled\\nhim. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had\\nto love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his\\nface. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for\\nboth of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\\n“It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business,\\nbut he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the\\ntruth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he\\nwas young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having\\ncharming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long\\npurses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to\\nsquander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and\\nimplore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle\\nhis debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the\\ndangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of\\nhis friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\\n“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell\\nshould gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my\\nhouse, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of\\nhis manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips,\\none who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man\\nof great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in\\n347\\ncold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced\\nfrom his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he\\nis one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my\\nlittle Mary, who has a woman’s quick insight into character.\\n“And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my\\nbrother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and\\nhave looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my\\nhouse—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet\\nas tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I\\ndo not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever\\ngone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he\\nloves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if\\nanyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she,\\nand that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is\\ntoo late—forever too late!\\n“Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I\\nshall continue with my miserable story.\\n“When we were taking coffee in the dr awing-room that night after dinner, I\\ntold Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we\\nhad under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who\\nhad brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear\\nthat the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished\\nto see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\\n“‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.\\n“‘In my own bureau.’\\n“‘Well, I hope to goo dness the house won’t be burgled during the night.’\\nsaid he.\\n“‘It is lo cked up,’ I answered.\\n“‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have\\nopened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’\\n“He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought littl e of what he said.\\nHe followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\\n“‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me h ave\\n200 pounds?’\\n“‘No, I canno t!’ I answered sharply. ‘I have been far too generous with you\\nin money matters.’\\n“‘You have been v ery kind,’ said he, ‘but I must have this money, or else I\\ncan never show my face inside the club again.’\\n“‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.\\n“‘Yes, but you would not have me lea ve it a dishonoured man,’ said he. ‘I\\ncould not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you\\nwill not let me have it, then I must try other means.’\\n“I was very angry, for this was the third demand d uring the month. ‘You\\nshall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on\\n349\\nwhich he bowed and left the room without another word. “When he was\\ngone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that\\nmy treasure was safe, and locked it again. T hen I started to go\\nround the house to see that all was secure—a duty which I\\nusually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perfor m\\nmyself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary he rself at the side\\nwindow of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\\n“‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, ‘did you give\\nLucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’ “‘Certainly not.’\\n“‘She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt\\nthat she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I\\nthink that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.’ “‘You m ust speak to her\\nin the morning, or I will if you\\nprefer it. Are you sure that eve rything is fastened?’ “‘Quite sure, dad.’\\n“‘Then, good-night.’ I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, w here\\nI was soon asleep.\\n“I am endeavourin g to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes,\\nwhich may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg tha t you\\nwill question me upon any point which I do not make cl ear.” “On the\\ncontrary, your statement is singularly lucid.” “I come to a part of my story\\nnow in which I should wish to\\nbe particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my\\nmind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in\\nthe morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had\\nceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as\\nthough a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my\\nears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving\\nsoftly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and\\npeeped round the corner of my dressing\\nroom door.\\n“‘Arthur!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief! How dare you\\ntouch that coronet?’\\n“The gas was half up , as I had left it, and my unhappy boy,\\ndressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside t he\\nlight, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be\\nwrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry\\nhe dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I\\nsnatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, w ith\\nthree of the beryls in it, was missing.\\n“‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with rage. ‘You\\nhave destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where\\nare the jewels which you have stolen?’\\n“‘Stolen!’ he cried.\\n“‘Yes, thief!’ I roa red, shaking him by the shoulder. “‘There are none\\nmissing. There cannot be any missing,’\\nsaid he.\\n“‘There are three missing. And you know where they are.\\nMust I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying\\n351\\nto tear off another piece?’\\n“‘You have called me nam es enough,’ said he, ‘I will not\\nstand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this\\nbusiness, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave y our\\nhouse in the morning and make my own way in the world. ’ “‘You shall\\nleave it in the hands of the police!’ I cried halfmad with grief and rage. ‘I\\nshall have this matter probed to the\\nbottom.’\\n“‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he with a passion\\nsuch as I should not have thought was in his nature. ‘If you\\nchoose to call the police, let the police find what they can .’ “By this time\\nthe whole house was astir, for I had raised my\\nvoice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush i nto my room,\\nand, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur’s face, she read\\nthe whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on th e\\nground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the inve stigation into\\ntheir hands at once. When the inspector and a\\nconstable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly\\nwith his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to\\ncharge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a\\nprivate matter, but had become a public one, since the ruine d\\ncoronet was national property. I was determined that the law\\nshould have its way in everything.\\n“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not h ave me arrested at once. It\\nwould be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave t he\\nhouse for five minutes.’\\n“‘That you may get awa y, or perhaps that you may conceal\\nwhat you have stolen,’ said I. And then, realising the dread ful\\nposition in which I was placed, I implored him to remember\\nthat not only my honour but that of one who was far greater\\nthan I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal\\nwhich would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he\\nwould but tell me what he had done with the three missing\\nstones.\\n“‘You m ay as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been\\ncaught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt\\nmore heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in you r\\npower, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgive n\\nand forgotten.’\\n“‘Keep your fo rgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning\\naway from me with a sneer. I saw that he was\\ntoo hardened for any words of mine to influen ce him. There\\nwas but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him\\ninto custody. A search was made at once not only of his perso n\\nbut of his room and of every portion of the house where he\\ncould possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them\\ncould be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth\\nfor all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was\\nremoved to a cell, and I, after going through all the police f ormalities, have\\nhurried round to you to implore you to use your\\nskill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they\\ncan at present make nothing of it. You may go\\n353\\nto any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward\\nof 1000 pounds. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems,\\nand my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!”\\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro,\\ndroning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted\\nand his eyes fixed upon the fire.\\n“Do you receive much company ?” he asked.\\n“None save my partner with his family and a n occasional friend of Arthur’s.\\nSir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else, I think.”\\n“Do you go out much in society?”\\n“Arthur does. Mary and I stay at h ome. We neither of us care for it.”\\n“That is unusual in a young girl.”\\n“She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-andtwenty.”\\n“This ma tter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.”\\n“Terrible! She is even more affected than I.”\\n“You have neither of you any doubt as to you r son’s guilt?”\\n“How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes wi th the coronet in\\nhis hands.”\\n“I hardly co nsider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet\\nat all injured?”\\n“Yes, it was tw isted.”\\n“Do you not think, the n, that he might have been trying to straighten it?”\\n“God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But i t is\\ntoo heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were\\ninnocent, why did he not say so?” “Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did\\nhe not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are\\nseveral singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise\\nwhich awoke you from your sleep?”\\n“They considered that it might be c aused by Arthur’s closing his bedroom\\ndoor.”\\n“A lik ely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to\\nwake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these\\ngems?”\\n“They a re still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope\\nof finding them.”\\n“Have they thoug ht of looking outside the house?” “Yes, they have shown\\nextraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely\\nexamined.”\\n“Now, my dear sir,” said Holmes. “is it not obvious to you now that this\\nmatter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at\\nfirst inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems\\nexceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You sup\\n355\\npose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your\\ndressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by\\nmain force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed\\nthree gems out of the thirtynine, with such skill that nobody can find them,\\nand then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he\\nexposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now,\\nis such a theory tenable?”\\n“But what other is there?” cried the banker with a gesture of despair. “If his\\nmotives were innocent, why does he not explain them?”\\n“It is our task to find that out,” replied Holmes; “so now, if you please, Mr.\\nHolder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to\\nglancing a little more closely into details.”\\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which\\nI was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply\\nstirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the\\nbanker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father,\\nbut still I had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I felt that there must be\\nsome grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted\\nexplanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern\\nsuburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his\\neyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh\\nheart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he\\neven broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short\\nrailway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest\\nresidence of the great financier.\\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a\\nlittle from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,\\nstretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance.\\nOn the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path\\nbetween two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and\\nforming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the\\nstables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though\\nlittle used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked\\nslowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and\\nso round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr.\\nHolder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he\\nshould return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a\\nyoung lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with\\ndark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of\\nher skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a\\nwoman’s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with\\ncrying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater\\nsense of grief than the banker\\n357\\nhad done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was\\nevidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for selfrestraint.\\nDisregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and\\npassed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\\n“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?”\\nshe asked.\\n“No, no, m y girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”\\n“But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woma n’s instincts are.\\nI know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted\\nso harshly.”\\n“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”\\n“Who knows? Perhaps because he was s o angry that you should suspect\\nhim.”\\n“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the\\ncoronet in his hand?”\\n“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for\\nit that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful\\nto think of our dear Arthur in prison!”\\n“I shall never let it drop until the g ems are found—never, Mary! Your\\naffection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far\\nfrom hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London\\nto inquire more deeply into it.”\\n“This gentleman?” she asked, f acing round to me.\\n“No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable\\nlane now.”\\n“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he hope to find\\nthere? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in\\nproving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of\\nthis crime.”\\n“I fully sha re your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,”\\nreturned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes.\\n“I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask\\nyou a question or two?”\\n“Pray do, sir, if it may h elp to clear this horrible affair up.”\\n“You heard nothing yourself last night?”\\n“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I\\ncame down.”\\n“You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the\\nwindows?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Were they all fastened this morning?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“You h ave a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your\\nuncle last night that she had been out to see him?”\\n“Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the draw ing-room, and who may\\nhave heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”\\n359\\n“I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that\\nthe two may have planned the robbery.”\\n“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker\\nimpatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his\\nhands?”\\n“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss\\nHolder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”\\n“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her\\nslipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”\\n“Do you know him?”\\n“Oh, yes! he is the gre en-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His name\\nis Francis Prosper.”\\n“He stood,” said Ho lmes, “to the left of the door—that is to say, farther up\\nthe path than is necessary to reach the door?”\\n“Yes, he did.”\\n“And he is a m an with a wooden leg?”\\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black eyes.\\n“Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you know that?” She\\nsmiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’ thin, eager face.\\n“I should be very glad now to go upstairs,” said he. “I shall probably wish\\nto go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at\\nthe lower windows before I go up.”\\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large\\none which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and\\nmade a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying\\nlens. “Now we shall go upstairs,” said he at last.\\nThe banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furn ished little chamber, with a\\ngrey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau\\nfirst and looked hard at the lock.\\n“Which key was used to open it? ” he asked.\\n“That which my son himself indicated—tha t of the cupboard of the lumberroom.”\\n“Have y ou it here?”\\n“That is it on the dre ssing-table.”\\nSherlock Holmes took it up and o pened the bureau.\\n“It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder t hat it did not wake you.\\nThis case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it.” He\\nopened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a\\nmagnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and the thirty-six stones were\\nthe finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked\\nedge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\\n“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds to\\nthat which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it\\noff.”\\nThe b anker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” said he.\\n361\\n“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result.\\n“I feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though I am exceptionally strong in the\\nfingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not\\ndo it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder?\\nThere would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this\\nhappened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?”\\n“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”\\n“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss\\nHolder?”\\n“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”\\n“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you sa w him?”\\n“He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”\\n“Thank you. We have certainly been favoured w ith extraordinary luck\\nduring this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not\\nsucceed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall\\nnow continue my investigations outside.”\\nHe went alone, at his own request, for h e explained that any unnecessary\\nfootmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was\\nat work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as\\ninscrutable as ever.\\n“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,” said he; “I\\ncan serve you best by returning to my rooms.”\\n“But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?” “I cannot tell.”\\nThe banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” h e cried. “And\\nmy son? You give me hopes?”\\n“My opinion is in no way alter ed.”\\n“Then, for God’s sake, what was th is dark business which was acted in my\\nhouse last night?”\\n“If you can call u pon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning\\nbetween nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I\\nunderstand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that\\nI get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.”\\n“I would give my fortune to have them back.”\\n“Very good. I shall look into the matter betwe en this and then. Good-bye; it\\nis just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.”\\nIt was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up ab out\\nthe case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even\\ndimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured\\nto sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other\\ntopic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we\\nfound ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and\\nwas down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his\\ncollar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he\\nwas a perfect sample of\\n363\\nthe class.\\n“I think th at this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass\\nabove the fireplace. “I only wish that you could come with m e,\\nWatson, but I fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this\\nmatter, or I may be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall\\nsoon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few\\nhours.” He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the side board, sandwiched\\nit between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket\\nhe started off upon his expedition.\\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in\\nexcellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand.\\nHe chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup\\nof tea.\\n“I only looked in as I passed,” said he. “I am going right\\non.”\\n“Wh ere to?”\\n“Oh, to the o ther side of the West End. It may be some\\ntime before I get back. Don’t wait up for me in case I s hould be\\nlate.”\\n“How are you getting on?”\\n“Oh, so so. Nothing to com plain of. I have been out to\\nStreatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house.\\nIt is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it\\nfor a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but\\nmust get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly\\nrespectable self.”\\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for\\nsatisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes\\ntwinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow\\ncheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard\\nthe slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once\\nmore upon his congenial hunt.\\nI waited until midnight, but the re was no sign of his return,\\nso I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to\\nbe away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a\\nscent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not kno w\\nat what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast\\nin the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand\\nand the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible. “Y ou will excuse\\nmy beginning without you, Watson,” said\\nhe, “but you remember that our client ha s rather an early appointment this\\nmorning.”\\n“Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should not be\\nsurprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.” It was , indeed, our friend\\nthe financier. I was shocked by\\nthe change which had come ove r him, for his face which was\\nnaturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched an d\\nfallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter.\\nHe entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even mo re\\npainful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped\\nheavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.\\n365\\n“I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he. “Only\\ntwo days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the\\nworld. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes\\nclose upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.”\\n“Deserted you?”\\n“Yes. Her bed th is morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and\\na note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow\\nand not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well\\nwith him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark\\nthat she refers in this note:\\n“‘MY DEAREST UNCLE :—I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,\\nand that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have\\noccurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under\\nyour roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my\\nfuture, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it\\nwill be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever\\nyour loving,—MARY.’\\n“What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to\\nsuicide?”\\n“No, no, n othing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust,\\nMr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.”\\n“Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned\\nsomething! Where are the gems?”\\n“You would not think 1000 pound s apiece an excessive sum for them?”\\n“I would pay ten.”\\n“That would be u nnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And\\nthere is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a pen.\\nBetter make it out for 4000 pounds.”\\nWith a dazed face the banker made o ut the required check. Holmes walked\\nover to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in\\nit, and threw it down upon the table.\\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutch ed it up.\\n“You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am s aved!”\\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief ha d been, and he hugged\\nhis recovered gems to his bosom.\\n“There is one other thing you o we, Mr. Holder,” said Sherlock Holmes\\nrather sternly.\\n“Owe!” He ca ught up a pen. “Name the sum, and I will pay it.”\\n“No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble\\nlad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to\\nsee my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.”\\n“Then it was not Arthur who took them?”\\n“I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.”\\n“You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let\\n367\\nhim know that the truth is known.”\\n“He knows it already. When I had c leared it all up I had an\\ninterview with him, and finding that he would not tell me th e\\nstory, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was\\nright and to add the very few details which were not yet qui te\\nclear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open h is\\nlips.”\\n“For h eaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary\\nmystery!”\\n“I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached\\nit. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me\\nto say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding\\nbetween Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They h ave\\nnow fled together.”\\n“My Mary? Imposs ible!”\\n“It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your\\nson knew the true character of this man\\nwhen you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of\\nthe most dangerous men in England—a ruined gambler, an\\nabsolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscie nce.\\nYour niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his\\nvows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she f lattered herself\\nthat she alone had touched his heart. The devil\\nknows best what he said, but at least she becam e his tool and\\nwas in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.” “I can not, and I will\\nnot, believe it!” cried the banker with\\nan ashen face.\\n“I will tell you , then, what occurred in your house last night.\\nYour niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room ,\\nslipped down and talked to her lover through the window whic h\\nleads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right\\nthrough the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of\\nthe coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and\\nhe bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but\\nthere are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all\\nother loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had\\nhardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming\\ndownstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told\\nyou about one of the servants’ escapade with her wooden-leg ged\\nlover, which was all perfectly true.\\n“Your boy, Arthur, went to bed afte r his interview with you\\nbut he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his clu b\\ndebts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his\\ndoor, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cou sin\\nwalking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared\\ninto your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad\\nslipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see\\nwhat would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerg ed\\nfrom the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your\\nson saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She\\npassed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along\\nand slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he coul d\\n369\\nsee what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window,\\nhand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once\\nmore hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid\\nbehind the curtain.\\n“As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a\\nhorrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she\\nwas gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and\\nhow all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in\\nhis bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down\\nthe lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George\\nBurnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle\\nbetween them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent\\nat the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the\\neye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had\\nthe coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your\\nroom, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the\\nstruggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the\\nscene.”\\n“Is it possible?” gasped the banker.\\n“You then roused his anger by calli ng him names at a moment when he felt\\nthat he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true\\nstate of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough\\nconsideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and\\npreserved her secret.”\\n“And that was why s he shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,”\\ncried Mr. Holder. “Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his\\nasking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to\\nsee if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I\\nhave misjudged him!”\\n“When I arrived at th e house,” continued Holmes, “I at once went very\\ncarefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which\\nmight help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and\\nalso that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed\\nalong the tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down and\\nindistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen\\ndoor, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions\\non one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had\\nbeen disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was\\nshown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a\\nlittle, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the\\nmaid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and\\ninquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing\\nanything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I\\ngot into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the\\nsnow in front of me.\\n371\\n“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\\nline which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at\\nonce convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The\\nfirst had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread\\nwas marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he\\nhad passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall\\nwindow, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I\\nwalked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane.\\nI saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though\\nthere had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had\\nfallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the\\nlane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had\\nbeen hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the\\npavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.\\n“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and\\nframework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that\\nsomeone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where\\nthe wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able\\nto form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the\\nwindow; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by\\nyour son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each\\ntugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither\\nalone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a\\nfragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now\\nwas, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?\\n“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,\\nwhatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that\\nit was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece\\nand the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself\\nto be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved\\nhis cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should\\nretain her secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I\\nremembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted\\non seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\\n“And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who\\nelse could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I\\nknew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very\\nlimited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him\\nbefore as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been\\nhe who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he\\nknew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he\\nwas safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own\\nfamily.\\n373\\n“Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went\\nin the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick up an\\nacquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the\\nnight before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by\\nbuying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to\\nStreatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.”\\n“I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” said Mr.\\nHolder.\\n“Precise ly. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and\\nchanged my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I\\nsaw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so\\nastute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and\\nsaw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him\\nevery particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a lifepreserver\\nfrom the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to\\nhis head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I\\ntold him that we would give him a price for the stones he held—1000\\npounds apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown.\\n‘Why, dash it all!’ said he, ‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I\\nsoon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on\\npromising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and\\nafter much chaffering I got our stones at 1000 pounds apiece. Then I looked\\nin upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed\\nabout two o’clock, after what I may call a really hard day’s work.”\\n“A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,” said the\\nbanker, rising. “Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find\\nme ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all\\nthat I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to\\nhim for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor\\nMary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where\\nshe is now.”\\n“I think that we may safely say,” returned Holmes, “that she is wherever Sir\\nGeorge Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are,\\nthey will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.”\\n12.\\nThe Adventure of the Copper Beeches.\\n“To the man who loves art for its own sake,” remarked Sherlock Holmes,\\ntossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, “it is\\nfrequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest\\npleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you\\nhave so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which\\nyou have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say,\\noccasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the\\nmany causes célèbres and sensational trials in which I have figured but\\nrather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but\\nwhich have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical\\nsynthesis which I have made my special province.”\\n375\\n“And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the\\ncharge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.”\\n“You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with\\nthe tongs and lighting with it the long cherrywood pipe which was wont to\\nreplace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative\\nmood—”you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into\\neach of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing\\nupon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the\\nonly notable feature about the thing.”\\n“It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,” I remarked\\nwith some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more\\nthan once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s singular character.\\n“No, it is not selfishness or conceit,” said he, answering, as was his wont,\\nmy thoughts rather than my words. “If I claim full justice for my art, it is\\nbecause it is an impersonal thing— a thing beyond myself. Crime is\\ncommon. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the\\ncrime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a\\ncourse of lectures into a series of tales.”\\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on\\neither side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog\\nrolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing\\nwindows loomed like\\n377\\ndark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and\\nshone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had\\nnot been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning,\\ndipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of\\npapers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged\\nin no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\\n“At the same time,” he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat\\npuffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, “you can hardly be\\nopen to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have\\nbeen so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of\\ncrime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to\\nhelp the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary\\nSutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and\\nthe incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the\\npale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have\\nbordered on the trivial.”\\n“The end may have been so,” I answered, “but the methods\\nI hold to have been novel and of interest.”\\n“Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the publi c, the great un\\nobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his t ooth\\nor a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades\\nof analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot blame\\nyou, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man,\\nhas lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems\\nto be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and\\ngiving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have\\ntouched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my\\nzero-point, I fancy. Read it!” He tossed a crumpled letter\\nacross to me.\\nIt was dated f rom Montague Place upon the preceding\\nevening, and ran thus:\\n“DEAR MR. HOLME S:—I am very anxious to consult\\nyou as to whether I should or should not accept a situati on\\nwhich has been offered to me as governess. I shall call a t halfpast ten tomorrow\\nif I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,\\n“VIOLET HUNTER.”\\n“Do you know the young lady?” I asked.\\n“Not I.”\\n“It is hal f-past ten now.”\\n“Yes, and I have no doub t that is her ring.”\\n“It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You\\nremember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere\\nwhim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this\\ncase, also.”\\n“Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here,\\nunless I am much mistaken, is the person in ques\\n379 tion.”\\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was\\nplainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover’s\\negg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to\\nmake in the world.\\n“You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,” said she, as my companion\\nrose to greet her, “but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no\\nparents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that\\nperhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.”\\n“Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to\\nserve you.”\\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and\\nspeech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and\\nthen composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together,\\nto listen to her story.\\n“I have been a gover ness for five years,” said she, “in the family of Colonel\\nSpence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at\\nHalifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so\\nthat I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered\\nadvertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had\\nsaved began to run short, and I was at my wit’s end as to what I should do.\\n“There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End calle d\\nWestaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see\\nwhether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the\\nname of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss\\nStoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking\\nemployment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when\\nshe consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would\\nsuit them.\\n“Well, wh en I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual,\\nbut I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a\\nvery smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon\\nfold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose,\\nlooking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite\\na jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\\n“‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for any thing better. Capital!\\ncapital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the\\nmost genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was\\nquite a pleasure to look at him.\\n“‘You are looking for a situatio n, miss?’ he asked.\\n“‘Yes, sir.’\\n“‘As gover ness?’\\n“‘Yes, sir.’\\n“‘And wha t salary do you ask?’\\n“‘I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.’\\n381\\n“‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat hands\\nout into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. ‘How could anyone\\noffer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?’\\n“‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,’ said I. ‘A little\\nFrench, a little German, music, and drawing— ’\\n“‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have\\nyou or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a\\nnutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who\\nmay some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if\\nyou have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to\\naccept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam,\\nwould commence at 100 pounds a year.’\\n“You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer\\nseemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps\\nthe look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a\\nnote.\\n“‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until\\nhis eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face,\\n‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they\\nmay meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.’\\n“It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a\\nman. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great\\nconvenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole\\ntransaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite\\ncommitted myself.\\n“‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.\\n“‘Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the\\nfar side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady,\\nand the dearest old country-house.’\\n“‘And my duties, sir? I should be gl ad to know what they would be.’\\n“‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you co uld see\\nhim killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone\\nbefore you could wink!’ He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes\\ninto his head again.\\n“I was a little star tled at the nature of the child’s amusement, but the\\nfather’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\\n“‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take charge of a sing le child?’\\n“‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,’ he cried. ‘Your\\nduty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any\\nlittle commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such\\ncommands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?’\\n“‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’\\n“‘Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know—\\nfaddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear\\n383\\nany dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little\\nwhim. Heh?’\\n“‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.\\n“‘Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offen sive to you?’\\n“‘Oh, no.’\\n“‘Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?’\\n“I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, M r. Holmes, my hair\\nis somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been\\nconsidered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand\\nfashion.\\n“‘I am a fraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I. He had been watching me\\neagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as\\nI spoke.\\n“‘I am a fraid that it is quite essential,’ said he. ‘It is a little fancy of my\\nwife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you know, madam, ladies’ fancies must be\\nconsulted. And so you won’t cut your hair?’\\n“‘No, sir, I really could not,’ I answered firm ly.\\n“‘Ah, very well; then that quite settles the ma tter. It is a pity, because in\\nother respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss\\nStoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.’\\n“The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word\\nto either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon\\nher face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome\\ncommission through my refusal.\\n“‘Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’ she asked.\\n“‘If you please, Miss Stoper.’\\n“‘Well, really, it seems rathe r useless, since you refuse the most excellent\\noffers in this fashion,’ said she sharply. ‘You can hardly expect us to exert\\nourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss\\nHunter.’ She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough\\nin the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table. I began to ask myself\\nwhether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had\\nstrange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters,\\nthey were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses\\nin England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides, what use was my hair to\\nme? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be\\namong the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a\\nmistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my\\npride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was\\nstill open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it\\nhere and I will read it to you: “‘The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\\n“‘DEAR MISS HUNTER:—Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your\\naddress, and I write from here\\n385\\nto ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very\\nanxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my\\ndescription of you. We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter, or 120\\npounds a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which\\nour fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is\\nfond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a\\ndress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of\\npurchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now\\nin Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to\\nsitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need\\ncause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity,\\nespecially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short\\ninterview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only\\nhope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your\\nduties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come,\\nand I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your\\ntrain.\\nYours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.’\\n“That is the letter which I have just rece ived, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is\\nmade up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final\\nstep I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.”\\n“Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the questio n,” said\\nHolmes, smiling.\\n“But you would n ot advise me to refuse?”\\n“I confess that it is not the situation whic h I should like to see a sister of\\nmine apply for.”\\n“What is the mea ning of it all, Mr. Holmes?”\\n“Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps y ou have yourself formed some\\nopinion?”\\n“Well, the re seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle\\nseemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife\\nis a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be\\ntaken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order\\nto prevent an outbreak?”\\n“That is a possible sol ution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the most\\nprobable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a\\nyoung lady.”\\n“But the mon ey, Mr. Holmes, the money!”\\n“Well, yes, of course the pay is good—to o good. That is what makes me\\nuneasy. Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when they could have\\ntheir pick for 40 pounds? There must be some strong reason behind.”\\n“I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would unde rstand\\nafterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that\\nyou were at the back of me.”\\n“Oh, you may carry that feel ing away with you. I assure you that your little\\nproblem promises to be the most interesting\\n387\\nwhich has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly\\nnovel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in\\ndanger—”\\n“Danger! What danger do you foresee?”\\nHolmes shook his head gravely. “It would cease to be a danger if we could\\ndefine it,” said he. “But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring\\nme down to your help.”\\n“That is enough.” She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept\\nfrom her face. “I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I\\nshall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start\\nfor Winchester to-morrow.” With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade\\nus both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\\n“At least,” said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs,\\n“she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.”\\n“And she would need to be,” said Holmes gravely. “I am much mistaken if\\nwe do not hear from her before many days are past.”\\nIt was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight\\nwent by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her\\ndirection and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this\\nlonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions,\\nthe light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or\\na plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite\\nbeyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat\\nfrequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air,\\nbut he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it.\\n“Data! data! data!” he cried impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without clay.”\\nAnd yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should\\never have accepted such a situation.\\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I\\nwas thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those\\nall-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I\\nwould leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him\\nin the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He\\nopened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it\\nacross to me.\\n“Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,” said he, and turned back to his\\nchemical studies.\\nThe summons wa s a brief and urgent one.\\n“Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Wi nchester at midday to-morrow,” it\\nsaid. “Do come! I am at my wit’s end. HUNTER.”\\n“Will you come with me?” asked Holmes, glancing up.\\n“I should wish to.”\\n“Just look it up, the n.”\\n“There is a train at half -past nine,” said I, glancing over my\\n389\\nBradshaw. “It is due at Winchester at 11:30.”\\n“That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better post\\npone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be a t our\\nbest in the morning.”\\nBy eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way\\nto the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the\\nmorning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the\\nHampshire border he threw them down and began to admire\\nthe scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, fleck ed\\nwith little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east.\\nThe sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhila rating nip in\\nthe air, which set an edge to a man’s energy.\\nAll over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around\\nAldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadin gs\\npeeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage. “Ar e they not fresh\\nand beautiful?” I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs\\nof Baker Street. But Holmes shook his head gravely.\\n“Do you know, Watson,” said he, “that it is one of th e curses\\nof a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything\\nwith reference to my own special subject. You look at these\\nscattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I lo ok\\nat them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling\\nof their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may\\nbe committed there.”\\n“Good heavens!” I cr ied. “Who would associate crime with\\nthese dear old homesteads?”\\n“They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief,\\nWatson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest an d vilest alleys in\\nLondon do not present a more dreadful record of\\nsin than does the smiling and beautiful countrysid e.” “You horrify me!”\\n“But the reason is very obvious.The pressure of public opinion can do in the\\ntown what the law cannot accomplish. There\\nis no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the\\nthud of a drunkard’s blow, does not beget sympathy and in dignation among\\nthe neighbours, and then the whole machinery\\nof justice is ever so close that a word of compl aint can set it\\ngoing, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock .\\nBut look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled f or\\nthe most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the\\nlaw. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wicked ness which may\\ngo on, year in, year out, in such places, and\\nnone the wiser. Had this lady who appeals t o us for help gone\\nto live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It\\nis the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is\\nclear that she is not personally threatened.”\\n“No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get\\naway.”\\n“Quite so. She has her freedom.”\\n“What can be the matter, then? C an you suggest no explanation?”\\n391\\n“I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the\\nfacts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be\\ndetermined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting\\nfor us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all\\nthat Miss Hunter has to tell.”\\nThe Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from\\nthe station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had\\nengaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\\n“I am so delighted that you have come,” she said earnestly. “It is so very\\nkind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice\\nwill be altogether invaluable to me.”\\n“Pray tell us what has happened to you.”\\n“I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be\\nback before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he\\nlittle knew for what purpose.”\\n“Let us have everything in its due order.” Holmes thrust his long thin legs\\nout towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\\n“In the first place, I may say that I have met, on th e whole, with no actual\\nill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that.\\nBut I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.”\\n“What can you not understand?”\\n“Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred.\\nWhen I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart\\nto the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not\\nbeautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but\\nall stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds\\nround it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down\\nto the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards\\nfrom the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the\\nwoods all round are part of Lord Southerton’s preserves. A clump of copper\\nbeeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the\\nplace.\\n“I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was\\nintroduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no\\ntruth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in\\nyour rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a\\nsilent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than\\nthirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their\\nconversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years,\\nthat he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the\\ndaughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that\\nthe reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion\\nto her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I\\ncan quite imagine that her posi\\n393 tion must have been uncomfo rtable with her father’s young wife.\\n“Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature.\\nShe impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity.\\nIt was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband\\nand to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to\\nthe other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind\\nto her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to\\nbe a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She\\nwould often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face.\\nMore than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that\\nit was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have\\nnever met so utterly spoiled and so illnatured a little creature. He is small\\nfor his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole\\nlife appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and\\ngloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than\\nhimself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite\\nremarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects.\\nBut I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he\\nhas little to do with my story.”\\n“I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they seem to you\\nto be relevant or not.”\\n“I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing\\nabout the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct\\nof the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is\\nhis name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a\\nperpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been\\nquite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is\\na very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle\\nand much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I\\nspend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to\\neach other in one corner of the building.\\n“For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very\\nquiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and\\nwhispered something to her husband.\\n“‘Oh, yes,’ said he, turning to me, ‘we are very much obliged to you, Miss\\nHunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you\\nthat it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall\\nnow see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid\\nout upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on\\nwe should both be extremely obliged.’\\n“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It\\nwas of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of\\nhaving been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been\\nmeasured for it. Both\\n395\\nMr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed\\nquite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the\\ndrawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front\\nof the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair\\nhad been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it.\\nIn this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on\\nthe other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories\\nthat I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I\\nlaughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently\\nno sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her\\nlap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle\\nsuddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and\\nthat I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\\n“Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly\\nsimilar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window,\\nand again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer\\nhad an immense répertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed\\nme a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my\\nown shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to\\nhim. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and\\nthen suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to\\nchange my dress. “You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I\\nbecame as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could\\npossibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face\\naway from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see\\nwhat was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but\\nI soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy\\nthought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief.\\nOn the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up\\nto my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was\\nbehind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least\\nthat was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived\\nthat there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded\\nman in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is\\nan important highway, and there are usually people there. This man,\\nhowever, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was\\nlooking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs.\\nRucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She\\nsaid nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in\\nmy hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.\\n“‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who\\nstares up at Miss Hunter.’\\n“‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.\\n397 “‘No, I know no one in these parts.’\\n“‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to\\ngo away.’\\n“‘Surely i t would be better to take no notice.’\\n“‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and\\nwave him away like that.’\\n“I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the\\nblind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the\\nwindow, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.”\\n“Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative promises to be a most\\ninteresting one.”\\n“You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little\\nrelation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first\\nday that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small\\nouthouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard\\nthe sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving\\nabout.\\n“‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks.\\n‘Is he not a beauty?’\\n“I looked through an d was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague\\nfigure huddled up in the darkness.\\n“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my em ployer, laughing at the start which I had\\ngiven. ‘It’s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my\\ngroom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a\\nday, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller\\nlets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his\\nfangs upon. For goodness’ sake don’t you ever on any pretext set your foot\\nover the threshold at night, for it’s as much as your life is worth.’\\n“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of\\nmy bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a beautiful\\nmoonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and\\nalmost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the\\nscene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of\\nthe copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It\\nwas a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black\\nmuzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and\\nvanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a\\nchill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\\n“And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you k now,\\ncut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom\\nof my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse\\nmyself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own\\nlittle things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper\\nones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled\\n399\\nthe first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was\\nnaturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that\\nit might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of\\nkeys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew\\nthe drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you\\nwould never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.\\n“I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same\\nthickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me.\\nHow could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I\\nundid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own\\nhair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were\\nidentical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing\\nat all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said\\nnothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the\\nwrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.\\n“I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I\\nsoon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one\\nwing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which\\nfaced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite,\\nbut it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I\\nmet Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a\\nlook on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial\\nman to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all\\ncrinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He\\nlocked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.\\n“This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds\\nwith my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the\\nwindows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three\\nof which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were\\nevidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them\\noccasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as\\never.\\n“‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word,\\nmy dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.’\\n“I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I, ‘you seem to\\nhave quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters\\nup.’\\n“He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.\\n“‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I have made my dark room\\nup there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.\\nWho would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?’ He spoke\\nin a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read\\nsuspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\\n401\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\\nsomething about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on\\nfire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of\\nthat. It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good might come\\nfrom my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s instinct; perhaps it\\nwas woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,\\nand I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\\n“It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr.\\nRucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted\\nrooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him\\nthrough the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday\\nevening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in\\nthe door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs.\\nRucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had\\nan admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the\\ndoor, and slipped through.\\n“There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which\\nturned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors\\nin a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an\\nempty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in\\nthe other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through\\nthem. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been\\nfastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring\\nin the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was\\nlocked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door\\ncorresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see\\nby the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness.\\nEvidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in\\nthe passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might\\nveil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow\\npass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone\\nout from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the\\nsight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned\\nand ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at\\nthe skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and\\nstraight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\\n“‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I\\nsaw the door open.’\\n“‘Oh, I am so fright ened!’ I panted.\\n“‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you cannot think how\\ncaressing and soothing his manner was—’and what has frightened you, my\\ndear young lady?’\\n“But his voice wa s just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on\\nmy guard against him.\\n“‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I an\\n403\\nswered. ‘But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened\\nand ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’\\n“‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.\\n“‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.\\n“‘Why do you think that I lock this do or?’\\n“‘I am sure that I do not know.’\\n“‘It is to keep people out who h ave no business there. Do\\nyou see?’ He was still smiling in the most amiable manner. “‘I am sure if I\\nhad known—’\\n“‘Well, then, y ou know now. And if you ever put your foot\\nover that threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin\\nof rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—’I’ll throw\\nyou to the mastiff.’\\n“I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have\\nrushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself\\nlying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I\\ncould not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the\\nhouse, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They\\nwere all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well.\\nOf course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as\\nstrong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I\\nput on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile\\nfrom the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible\\ndoubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be\\nloose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of\\ninsensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the\\nhousehold who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would\\nventure to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in\\nmy joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to\\ncome into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock,\\nfor Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the\\nevening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my\\nadventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what\\nit all means, and, above all, what I should do.”\\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend\\nrose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an\\nexpression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\\n“Is Toller still drunk?” he asked.\\n“Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with\\nhim.”\\n“That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Is the re a cellar with a good strong lock?”\\n“Yes, the wine-cellar.”\\n“You seem to me to ha ve acted all through this matter like a very brave and\\nsensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that\\n405 you could perform one more f eat? I should not ask it of you if\\nI did not think you a quite exceptional woman.”\\n“I will try. What is it?”\\n“We shall be at the Cop per Beeches by seven o’clock, my\\nfriend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we\\nhope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the\\nalarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn\\nthe key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.”\\n“I will do it.”\\n“Excellent! W e shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is\\nonly one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate\\nsomeone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is\\nobvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter,\\nMiss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to\\nAmerica. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure,\\nand the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some\\nillness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be\\nsacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in\\nthe road was undoubtedly some friend of hers—possibly her fiancé—and\\nno doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress and were so like her, he was\\nconvinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from\\nyour gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer\\ndesired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from\\nendeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most\\nserious point in the case is the disposition of the child.”\\n“What on earth has that to do with it?” I ejaculated.\\n“My dear Watson, you as a medical man are contin ually gaining light as to\\nthe tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see that the\\nconverse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into\\nthe character of parents by studying their children. This child’s disposition\\nis abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s sake, and whether he derives this\\nfrom his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes\\nevil for the poor girl who is in their power.”\\n“I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes, ” cried our client. “A thousand\\nthings come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let\\nus lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.”\\n“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cu nning man. We\\ncan do nothing until seven o’clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it\\nwill not be long before we solve the mystery.”\\nWe were as good as our word, for it was jus t seven when we reached the\\nCopper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The\\ngroup of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the\\nlight of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss\\nHunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\\n407 “Have you managed it?” aske d Holmes.\\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. “That is Mrs.\\nToller in the cellar,” said she. “Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug.\\nHere are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle’s.”\\n“You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes with enthusiasm. “Now lead\\nthe way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.”\\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and\\nfound ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described.\\nHolmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the\\nvarious keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within,\\nand at the silence Holmes’ face clouded over.\\n“I trust that we are not too late,” said he. “I think, Miss Hunter, that we had\\nbetter go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall\\nsee whether we cannot make our way in.”\\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.\\nTogether we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture\\nsave a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight\\nabove was open, and the prisoner gone.\\n“There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes; “this beauty has guessed\\nMiss Hunter’s intentions and has carried his victim off.”\\n“But how?”\\n“Through th e skylight. We shall soon see how he managed\\nit.” He swung himself up onto the roof. “Ah, yes,” he cried, “here’s the end\\nof a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.”\\n“But it is impossible,” said Miss Hunter; “the ladder was not there when the\\nRucastles went away.”\\n“He has come back an d done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous\\nman. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear\\nnow upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have\\nyour pistol ready.”\\nThe words were ha rdly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door\\nof the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss\\nHunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but\\nSherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\\n“You villain!” said he, “where’s your daughter?”\\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at th e open skylight.\\n“It is for me to ask you that,” he shrieked, “you thieves! Spies and thieves! I\\nhave caught you, have I? You are in my power. I’ll serve you!” He turned\\nand clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\\n“He’s gone for the dog!” cried Miss Hunter.\\n“I have my revolver,” said I.\\n409\\n“Better close the front door,” cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the\\nstairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of\\na hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which\\nit was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking\\nlimbs came staggering out at a side door.\\n“My God!” he cried. “Someone has loosed the dog. It’s not been fed for two\\ndays. Quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!”\\nHolmes and I rushed out and round t he angle of the house, with Toller\\nhurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle\\nburied in Rucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground.\\nRunning up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth\\nstill meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we\\nseparated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house.\\nWe laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the\\nsobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his\\npain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall,\\ngaunt woman entered the room.\\n“Mrs. Toller!” cried Miss Hunte r.\\n“Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me o ut when he came back before he went up\\nto you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were\\nplanning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”\\n“Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is clear that Mrs. To ller knows\\nmore about this matter than anyone else.”\\n“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to t ell what I know.”\\n“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are s everal points on\\nwhich I must confess that I am still in the dark.”\\n“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “a nd I’d have done so before\\nnow if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If there’s police-court business\\nover this, you’ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and\\nthat I was Miss Alice’s friend too.\\n“She was never happy at home, M iss Alice wasn’t, from the time that her\\nfather married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but\\nit never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a\\nfriend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by\\nwill, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word\\nabout them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle’s hands. He knew he was\\nsafe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward,\\nwho would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought\\nit time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she\\nmarried or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept\\non worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s\\ndoor. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her\\nbeautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young man, and\\nhe stuck to her as true as man could be.”\\n411\\n“Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good enough to tell us\\nmakes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr.\\nRucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?”\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n“And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the\\ndisagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.”\\n“That was it, sir.”\\n“But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,\\nblockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,\\nmetallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same\\nas his.”\\n“Mr. Fo wler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said Mrs.\\nToller serenely.\\n“And in this wa y he managed that your good man should have no want of\\ndrink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master\\nhad gone out.”\\n“You have it, s ir, just as it happened.”\\n“I am sure we owe you an apology, M rs.Toller,” said Holmes, “for you have\\ncertainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the\\ncountry surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best\\nescort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus\\nstandi now is rather a questionable one.”\\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of t he sinister house with the copper\\nbeeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a\\nbroken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They\\nstill live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle’s\\npast life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss\\nRucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after\\ntheir flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the\\nisland of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to\\nmy disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had\\nceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a\\nprivate school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable\\nsuccess.\\nPROLOGUE\\nIT was 2 p.m. on the afternoon of May 7, 1915. The Lusitania had\\nbeen struck by two torpedoes in succession and was sinking\\nrapidly, while the boats were being launched with all possible\\nspeed. The women and children were being lined up awaiting their\\nturn. Some still clung desperately to husbands and fathers;\\nothers clutched their children closely to their breasts. One girl\\nstood alone, slightly apart from the rest. She was quite young,\\nnot more than eighteen. She did not seem afraid, and her grave,\\nsteadfast eyes looked straight ahead.\\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\\nA man\\'s voice beside her made her start and turn. She had\\nnoticed the speaker more than once amongst the first-class\\npassengers. There had been a hint of mystery about him which had\\nappealed to her imagination. He spoke to no one. If anyone spoke\\nto him he was quick to rebuff the overture. Also he had a nervous\\nway of looking over his shoulder with a swift, suspicious glance.\\nShe noticed now that he was greatly agitated. There were beads\\nof perspiration on his brow. He was evidently in a state of\\novermastering fear. And yet he did not strike her as the kind of\\nman who would be afraid to meet death!\\n\"Yes?\" Her grave eyes met his inquiringly.\\nHe stood looking at her with a kind of desperate irresolution.\\n\"It must be!\" he muttered to himself. \"Yes--it is the only way.\"\\nThen aloud he said abruptly: \"You are an American?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"A patriotic one?\"\\nThe girl flushed.\\n\"I guess you\\'ve no right to ask such a thing! Of course I am!\"\\n\"Don\\'t be offended. You wouldn\\'t be if you knew how much there\\nwas at stake. But I\\'ve got to trust some one--and it must be a\\nwoman.\"\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Because of \\'women and children first.\\' \" He looked round and\\nlowered his voice. \"I\\'m carrying papers--vitally important\\npapers. They may make all the difference to the Allies in the\\nwar. You understand? These papers have GOT to be saved! They\\'ve\\nmore chance with you than with me. Will you take them?\"\\nThe girl held out her hand.\\n\"Wait--I must warn you. There may be a risk--if I\\'ve been\\nfollowed. I don\\'t think I have, but one never knows. If so,\\nthere will be danger. Have you the nerve to go through with it?\"\\nThe girl smiled.\\n\"I\\'ll go through with it all right. And I\\'m real proud to be\\nchosen! What am I to do with them afterwards?\"\\n\"Watch the newspapers! I\\'ll advertise in the personal column of\\nthe Times, beginning \\'Shipmate.\\' At the end of three days if\\nthere\\'s nothing--well, you\\'ll know I\\'m down and out. Then take\\nthe packet to the American Embassy, and deliver it into the\\nAmbassador\\'s own hands. Is that clear?\"\\n\"Quite clear.\"\\n\"Then be ready--I\\'m going to say good-bye.\" He took her hand in\\nhis. \"Good-bye. Good luck to you,\" he said in a louder tone.\\nHer hand closed on the oilskin packet that had lain in his palm.\\nThe Lusitania settled with a more decided list to starboard. In\\nanswer to a quick command, the girl went forward to take her\\nplace in the boat.\\nCHAPTER I\\nTHE YOUNG ADVENTURERS, LTD.\\n\"TOMMY, old thing!\"\\n\"Tuppence, old bean!\"\\nThe two young people greeted each other affectionately, and\\nmomentarily blocked the Dover Street Tube exit in doing so. The\\nadjective \"old\" was misleading. Their united ages would\\ncertainly not have totalled forty-five.\\n\"Not seen you for simply centuries,\" continued the young man.\\n\"Where are you off to? Come and chew a bun with me. We\\'re\\ngetting a bit unpopular here--blocking the gangway as it were.\\nLet\\'s get out of it.\"\\nThe girl assenting, they started walking down Dover Street\\ntowards Piccadilly.\\n\"Now then,\" said Tommy, \"where shall we go?\"\\nThe very faint anxiety which underlay his tone did not escape the\\nastute ears of Miss Prudence Cowley, known to her intimate\\nfriends for some mysterious reason as \"Tuppence.\" She pounced at\\nonce.\\n\"Tommy, you\\'re stony!\"\\n\"Not a bit of it,\" declared Tommy unconvincingly. \"Rolling in\\ncash.\"\\n\"You always were a shocking liar,\" said Tuppence severely,\\n\"though you did once persuade Sister Greenbank that the doctor\\nhad ordered you beer as a tonic, but forgotten to write it on the\\nchart. Do you remember?\"\\nTommy chuckled.\\n\"I should think I did! Wasn\\'t the old cat in a rage when she\\nfound out? Not that she was a bad sort really, old Mother\\nGreenbank! Good old hospital--demobbed like everything else, I\\nsuppose?\"\\nTuppence sighed.\\n\"Yes. You too?\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"Two months ago.\"\\n\"Gratuity?\" hinted Tuppence.\\n\"Spent.\"\\n\"Oh, Tommy!\"\\n\"No, old thing, not in riotous dissipation. No such luck! The\\ncost of living--ordinary plain, or garden living nowadays is, I\\nassure you, if you do not know----\"\\n\"My dear child,\" interrupted Tuppence, \"there is nothing I do NOT\\nknow about the cost of living. Here we are at Lyons\\', and we\\nwill each of us pay for our own. That\\'s it!\" And Tuppence led\\nthe way upstairs.\\nThe place was full, and they wandered about looking for a table,\\ncatching odds and ends of conversation as they did so.\\n\"And--do you know, she sat down and CRIED when I told her she\\ncouldn\\'t have the flat after all.\" \"It was simply a BARGAIN, my\\ndear! Just like the one Mabel Lewis brought from Paris----\"\\n\"Funny scraps one does overhear,\" murmured Tommy. \"I passed two\\nJohnnies in the street to-day talking about some one called Jane\\nFinn. Did you ever hear such a name?\"\\nBut at that moment two elderly ladies rose and collected parcels,\\nand Tuppence deftly ensconced herself in one of the vacant seats.\\nTommy ordered tea and buns. Tuppence ordered tea and buttered\\ntoast.\\n\"And mind the tea comes in separate teapots,\" she added severely.\\nTommy sat down opposite her. His bared head revealed a shock of\\nexquisitely slicked-back red hair. His face was pleasantly\\nugly--nondescript, yet unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a\\nsportsman. His brown suit was well cut, but perilously near the\\nend of its tether.\\nThey were an essentially modern-looking couple as they sat there.\\nTuppence had no claim to beauty, but there was character and\\ncharm in the elfin lines of her little face, with its determined\\nchin and large, wide-apart grey eyes that looked mistily out from\\nunder straight, black brows. She wore a small bright green toque\\nover her black bobbed hair, and her extremely short and rather\\nshabby skirt revealed a pair of uncommonly dainty ankles. Her\\nappearance presented a valiant attempt at smartness.\\nThe tea came at last, and Tuppence, rousing herself from a fit of\\nmeditation, poured it out.\\n\"Now then,\" said Tommy, taking a large bite of bun, \"let\\'s get\\nup-to-date. Remember, I haven\\'t seen you since that time in\\nhospital in 1916.\"\\n\"Very well.\" Tuppence helped herself liberally to buttered\\ntoast. \"Abridged biography of Miss Prudence Cowley, fifth\\ndaughter of Archdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell, Suffolk.\\nMiss Cowley left the delights (and drudgeries) of her home life\\nearly in the war and came up to London, where she entered an\\nofficers\\' hospital. First month: Washed up six hundred and\\nforty-eight plates every day. Second month: Promoted to drying\\naforesaid plates. Third month: Promoted to peeling potatoes.\\nFourth month: Promoted to cutting bread and butter. Fifth month:\\nPromoted one floor up to duties of wardmaid with mop and pail.\\nSixth month: Promoted to waiting at table. Seventh month:\\nPleasing appearance and nice manners so striking that am promoted\\nto waiting on the Sisters! Eighth month: Slight check in career.\\nSister Bond ate Sister Westhaven\\'s egg! Grand row! Wardmaid\\nclearly to blame! Inattention in such important matters cannot\\nbe too highly censured. Mop and pail again! How are the mighty\\nfallen! Ninth month: Promoted to sweeping out wards, where I\\nfound a friend of my childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford\\n(bow, Tommy!), whom I had not seen for five long years. The\\nmeeting was affecting! Tenth month: Reproved by matron for\\nvisiting the pictures in company with one of the patients,\\nnamely: the aforementioned Lieutenant Thomas Beresford.\\nEleventh and twelfth months: Parlourmaid duties resumed with\\nentire success. At the end of the year left hospital in a blaze\\nof glory. After that, the talented Miss Cowley drove\\nsuccessively a trade delivery van, a motor-lorry and a general!\"\\nThe last was the pleasantest. He was quite a young general!\"\\n\"What brighter was that?\" inquired Tommy. \"Perfectly sickening\\nthe way those brass hats drove from the War Office to the Savoy,\\nand from the Savoy to the War Office!\"\\n\"I\\'ve forgotten his name now,\" confessed Tuppence. \"To resume,\\nthat was in a way the apex of my career. I next entered a\\nGovernment office. We had several very enjoyable tea parties. I\\nhad intended to become a land girl, a postwoman, and a bus\\nconductress by way of rounding off my career--but the Armistice\\nintervened! I clung to the office with the true limpet touch for\\nmany long months, but, alas, I was combed out at last. Since then\\nI\\'ve been looking for a job. Now then--your turn.\"\\n\"There\\'s not so much promotion in mine,\" said Tommy regretfully,\\n\"and a great deal less variety. I went out to France again, as\\nyou know. Then they sent me to Mesopotamia, and I got wounded\\nfor the second time, and went into hospital out there. Then I got\\nstuck in Egypt till the Armistice happened, kicked my heels there\\nsome time longer, and, as I told you, finally got demobbed. And,\\nfor ten long, weary months I\\'ve been job hunting! There aren\\'t\\nany jobs! And, if there were, they wouldn\\'t give \\'em to me. What\\ngood am I? What do I know about business? Nothing.\"\\nTuppence nodded gloomily.\\n\"What about the colonies?\" she suggested.\\nTommy shook his head.\\n\"I shouldn\\'t like the colonies--and I\\'m perfectly certain they\\nwouldn\\'t like me!\"\\n\"Rich relations?\"\\nAgain Tommy shook his head.\\n\"Oh, Tommy, not even a great-aunt?\"\\n\"I\\'ve got an old uncle who\\'s more or less rolling, but he\\'s no\\ngood.\"\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\"Wanted to adopt me once. I refused.\"\\n\"I think I remember hearing about it,\" said Tuppence slowly. \"You\\nrefused because of your mother----\"\\nTommy flushed.\\n\"Yes, it would have been a bit rough on the mater. As you know,\\nI was all she had. Old boy hated her--wanted to get me away from\\nher. Just a bit of spite.\"\\n\"Your mother\\'s dead, isn\\'t she?\" said Tuppence gently.\\nTommy nodded.\\nTuppence\\'s large grey eyes looked misty.\\n\"You\\'re a good sort, Tommy. I always knew it.\"\\n\"Rot!\" said Tommy hastily. \"Well, that\\'s my position. I\\'m just\\nabout desperate.\"\\n\"So am I! I\\'ve hung out as long as I could. I\\'ve touted round.\\nI\\'ve answered advertisements. I\\'ve tried every mortal blessed\\nthing. I\\'ve screwed and saved and pinched! But it\\'s no good. I\\nshall have to go home!\"\\n\"Don\\'t you want to?\"\\n\"Of course I don\\'t want to! What\\'s the good of being\\nsentimental? Father\\'s a dear--I\\'m awfully fond of him--but you\\'ve\\nno idea how I worry him! He has that delightful early Victorian\\nview that short skirts and smoking are immoral. You can imagine\\nwhat a thorn in the flesh I am to him! He just heaved a sigh of\\nrelief when the war took me off. You see, there are seven of us\\nat home. It\\'s awful! All housework and mothers\\' meetings! I\\nhave always been the changeling. I don\\'t want to go back,\\nbut--oh, Tommy, what else is there to do?\"\\nTommy shook his head sadly. There was a silence, and then\\nTuppence burst out:\\n\"Money, money, money! I think about money morning, noon and\\nnight! I dare say it\\'s mercenary of me, but there it is!\"\\n\"Same here,\" agreed Tommy with feeling.\\n\"I\\'ve thought over every imaginable way of getting it too,\"\\ncontinued Tuppence. \"There are only three! To be left it, to\\nmarry it, or to make it. First is ruled out. I haven\\'t got any\\nrich elderly relatives. Any relatives I have are in homes for\\ndecayed gentlewomen! I always help old ladies over crossings,\\nand pick up parcels for old gentlemen, in case they should turn\\nout to be eccentric millionaires. But not one of them has ever\\nasked me my name--and quite a lot never said \\'Thank you.\\' \"\\nThere was a pause.\\n\"Of course,\" resumed Tuppence, \"marriage is my best chance. I\\nmade up my mind to marry money when I was quite young. Any\\nthinking girl would! I\\'m not sentimental, you know.\" She paused.\\n\"Come now, you can\\'t say I\\'m sentimental,\" she added sharply.\\n\"Certainly not,\" agreed Tommy hastily. \"No one would ever think\\nof sentiment in connection with you.\"\\n\"That\\'s not very polite,\" replied Tuppence. \"But I dare say you\\nmean it all right. Well, there it is! I\\'m ready and willing--but\\nI never meet any rich men! All the boys I know are about as hard\\nup as I am.\"\\n\"What about the general?\" inquired Tommy.\\n\"I fancy he keeps a bicycle shop in time of peace,\" explained\\nTuppence. \"No, there it is! Now you could marry a rich girl.\"\\n\"I\\'m like you. I don\\'t know any.\"\\n\"That doesn\\'t matter. You can always get to know one. Now, if I\\nsee a man in a fur coat come out of the Ritz I can\\'t rush up to\\nhim and say: \\'Look here, you\\'re rich. I\\'d like to know you.\\' \"\\n\"Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed\\nfemale?\"\\n\"Don\\'t be silly. You tread on her foot, or pick up her\\nhandkerchief, or something like that. If she thinks you want to\\nknow her she\\'s flattered, and will manage it for you somehow.\"\\n\"You overrate my manly charms,\" murmured Tommy.\\n\"On the other hand,\" proceeded Tuppence, \"my millionaire would\\nprobably run for his life! No--marriage is fraught with\\ndifficulties. Remains--to MAKE money!\"\\n\"We\\'ve tried that, and failed,\" Tommy reminded her.\\n\"We\\'ve tried all the orthodox ways, yes. But suppose we try the\\nunorthodox. Tommy, let\\'s be adventurers!\"\\n\"Certainly,\" replied Tommy cheerfully. \"How do we begin?\"\\n\"That\\'s the difficulty. If we could make ourselves known, people\\nmight hire us to commit crimes for them.\"\\n\"Delightful,\" commented Tommy. \"Especially coming from a\\nclergyman\\'s daughter!\"\\n\"The moral guilt,\" Tuppence pointed out, \"would be theirs--not\\nmine. You must admit that there\\'s a difference between stealing a\\ndiamond necklace for yourself and being hired to steal it.\"\\n\"There wouldn\\'t be the least difference if you were caught!\"\\n\"Perhaps not. But I shouldn\\'t be caught. I\\'m so clever.\"\\n\"Modesty always was your besetting sin,\" remarked Tommy.\\n\"Don\\'t rag. Look here, Tommy, shall we really? Shall we form a\\nbusiness partnership?\"\\n\"Form a company for the stealing of diamond necklaces?\"\\n\"That was only an illustration. Let\\'s have a--what do you call\\nit in book-keeping?\"\\n\"Don\\'t know. Never did any.\"\\n\"I have--but I always got mixed up, and used to put credit\\nentries on the debit side, and vice versa--so they fired me out.\\nOh, I know--a joint venture! It struck me as such a romantic\\nphrase to come across in the middle of musty old figures. It\\'s\\ngot an Elizabethan flavour about it--makes one think of galleons\\nand doubloons. A joint venture!\"\\n\"Trading under the name of the Young Adventurers, Ltd.? Is that\\nyour idea, Tuppence?\"\\n\"It\\'s all very well to laugh, but I feel there might be something\\nin it.\"\\n\"How do you propose to get in touch with your would-be\\nemployers?\"\\n\"Advertisement,\" replied Tuppence promptly. \"Have you got a bit\\nof paper and a pencil? Men usually seem to have. Just like we\\nhave hairpins and powder-puffs.\"\\nTommy handed over a rather shabby green notebook, and Tuppence\\nbegan writing busily.\\n\"Shall we begin: \\'Young officer, twice wounded in the war--\\' \"\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\n\"Oh, very well, my dear boy. But I can assure you that that sort\\nof thing might touch the heart of an elderly spinster, and she\\nmight adopt you, and then there would be no need for you to be a\\nyoung adventurer at all.\"\\n\"I don\\'t want to be adopted.\"\\n\"I forgot you had a prejudice against it. I was only ragging\\nyou! The papers are full up to the brim with that type of thing.\\nNow listen--how\\'s this? \\'Two young adventurers for hire. Willing\\nto do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good.\\' (We might as\\nwell make that clear from the start.) Then we might add: \\'No\\nreasonable offer refused\\'--like flats and furniture.\"\\n\"I should think any offer we get in answer to that would be a\\npretty UNreasonable one!\"\\n\"Tommy! You\\'re a genius! That\\'s ever so much more chic. \\'No\\nunreasonable offer refused--if pay is good.\\' How\\'s that?\"\\n\"I shouldn\\'t mention pay again. It looks rather eager.\"\\n\"It couldn\\'t look as eager as I feel! But perhaps you are right.\\nNow I\\'ll read it straight through. \\'Two young adventurers for\\nhire. Willing to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. No\\nunreasonable offer refused.\\' How would that strike you if you\\nread it?\"\\n\"It would strike me as either being a hoax, or else written by a\\nlunatic.\"\\n\"It\\'s not half so insane as a thing I read this morning beginning\\n\\'Petunia\\' and signed \\'Best Boy.\\' \" She tore out the leaf and\\nhanded it to Tommy. \"There you are. Times, I think. Reply to\\nBox so-and-so. I expect it will be about five shillings. Here\\'s\\nhalf a crown for my share.\"\\nTommy was holding the paper thoughtfully. His faced burned a\\ndeeper red.\\n\"Shall we really try it?\" he said at last. \"Shall we, Tuppence?\\nJust for the fun of the thing?\"\\n\"Tommy, you\\'re a sport! I knew you would be! Let\\'s drink to\\nsuccess.\" She poured some cold dregs of tea into the two cups.\\n\"Here\\'s to our joint venture, and may it prosper!\"\\n\"The Young Adventurers, Ltd.!\" responded Tommy.\\nThey put down the cups and laughed rather uncertainly. Tuppence\\nrose.\\n\"I must return to my palatial suite at the hostel.\"\\n\"Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the Ritz,\" agreed Tommy\\nwith a grin. \"Where shall we meet? And when?\"\\n\"Twelve o\\'clock to-morrow. Piccadilly Tube station. Will that\\nsuit you?\"\\n\"My time is my own,\" replied Mr. Beresford magnificently.\\n\"So long, then.\"\\n\"Good-bye, old thing.\"\\nThe two young people went off in opposite directions. Tuppence\\'s\\nhostel was situated in what was charitably called Southern\\nBelgravia. For reasons of economy she did not take a bus.\\nShe was half-way across St. James\\'s Park, when a man\\'s voice\\nbehind her made her start.\\n\"Excuse me,\" it said. \"But may I speak to you for a moment?\"\\nCHAPTER II\\nMR. WHITTINGTON\\'S OFFER\\nTUPPENCE turned sharply, but the words hovering on the tip of her\\ntongue remained unspoken, for the man\\'s appearance and manner did\\nnot bear out her first and most natural assumption. She\\nhesitated. As if he read her thoughts, the man said quickly:\\n\"I can assure you I mean no disrespect.\"\\nTuppence believed him. Although she disliked and distrusted him\\ninstinctively, she was inclined to acquit him of the particular\\nmotive which she had at first attributed to him. She looked him\\nup and down. He was a big man, clean shaven, with a heavy jowl.\\nHis eyes were small and cunning, and shifted their glance under\\nher direct gaze.\\n\"Well, what is it?\" she asked.\\nThe man smiled.\\n\"I happened to overhear part of your conversation with the young\\ngentleman in Lyons\\'.\"\\n\"Well--what of it?\"\\n\"Nothing--except that I think I may be of some use to you.\"\\nAnother inference forced itself into Tuppence\\'s mind:\\n\"You followed me here?\"\\n\"I took that liberty.\"\\n\"And in what way do you think you could be of use to me?\"\\nThe man took a card from his pocket and handed it to her with a\\nbow.\\nTuppence took it and scrutinized it carefully. It bore the\\ninscription, \"Mr. Edward Whittington.\" Below the name were the\\nwords \"Esthonia Glassware Co.,\" and the address of a city office.\\nMr. Whittington spoke again:\\n\"If you will call upon me to-morrow morning at eleven o\\'clock, I\\nwill lay the details of my proposition before you.\"\\n\"At eleven o\\'clock?\" said Tuppence doubtfully.\\n\"At eleven o\\'clock.\"\\nTuppence made up her mind.\\n\"Very well. I\\'ll be there.\"\\n\"Thank you. Good evening.\"\\nHe raised his hat with a flourish, and walked away. Tuppence\\nremained for some minutes gazing after him. Then she gave a\\ncurious movement of her shoulders, rather as a terrier shakes\\nhimself.\\n\"The adventures have begun,\" she murmured to herself. \"What does\\nhe want me to do, I wonder? There\\'s something about you, Mr.\\nWhittington, that I don\\'t like at all. But, on the other hand,\\nI\\'m not the least bit afraid of you. And as I\\'ve said before, and\\nshall doubtless say again, little Tuppence can look after\\nherself, thank you!\"\\nAnd with a short, sharp nod of her head she walked briskly\\nonward. As a result of further meditations, however, she turned\\naside from the direct route and entered a post office. There she\\npondered for some moments, a telegraph form in her hand. The\\nthought of a possible five shillings spent unnecessarily spurred\\nher to action, and she decided to risk the waste of ninepence.\\nDisdaining the spiky pen and thick, black treacle which a\\nbeneficent Government had provided, Tuppence drew out Tommy\\'s\\npencil which she had retained and wrote rapidly: \"Don\\'t put in\\nadvertisement. Will explain to-morrow.\" She addressed it to Tommy\\nat his club, from which in one short month he would have to\\nresign, unless a kindly fortune permitted him to renew his\\nsubscription.\\n\"It may catch him,\" she murmured. \"Anyway, it\\'s worth trying.\"\\nAfter handing it over the counter she set out briskly for home,\\nstopping at a baker\\'s to buy three penny-worth of new buns.\\nLater, in her tiny cubicle at the top of the house she munched\\nbuns and reflected on the future. What was the Esthonia\\nGlassware Co., and what earthly need could it have for her\\nservices? A pleasurable thrill of excitement made Tuppence\\ntingle. At any rate, the country vicarage had retreated into the\\nbackground again. The morrow held possibilities.\\nIt was a long time before Tuppence went to sleep that night, and,\\nwhen at length she did, she dreamed that Mr. Whittington had set\\nher to washing up a pile of Esthonia Glassware, which bore an\\nunaccountable resemblance to hospital plates!\\nIt wanted some five minutes to eleven when Tuppence reached the\\nblock of buildings in which the offices of the Esthonia Glassware\\nCo. were situated. To arrive before the time would look\\nover-eager. So Tuppence decided to walk to the end of the street\\nand back again. She did so. On the stroke of eleven she plunged\\ninto the recesses of the building. The Esthonia Glassware Co.\\nwas on the top floor. There was a lift, but Tuppence chose to\\nwalk up.\\nSlightly out of breath, she came to a halt outside the ground\\nglass door with the legend painted across it \"Esthonia Glassware\\nCo.\"\\nTuppence knocked. In response to a voice from within, she turned\\nthe handle and walked into a small rather dirty outer office.\\nA middle-aged clerk got down from a high stool at a desk near the\\nwindow and came towards her inquiringly.\\n\"I have an appointment with Mr. Whittington,\" said Tuppence.\\n\"Will you come this way, please.\" He crossed to a partition door\\nwith \"Private\" on it, knocked, then opened the door and stood\\naside to let her pass in.\\nMr. Whittington was seated behind a large desk covered with\\npapers. Tuppence felt her previous judgment confirmed. There was\\nsomething wrong about Mr. Whittington. The combination of his\\nsleek prosperity and his shifty eye was not attractive.\\nHe looked up and nodded.\\n\"So you\\'ve turned up all right? That\\'s good. Sit down, will\\nyou?\"\\nTuppence sat down on the chair facing him. She looked\\nparticularly small and demure this morning. She sat there meekly\\nwith downcast eyes whilst Mr. Whittington sorted and rustled\\namongst his papers. Finally he pushed them away, and leaned over\\nthe desk.\\n\"Now, my dear young lady, let us come to business.\" His large\\nface broadened into a smile. \"You want work? Well, I have work\\nto offer you. What should you say now to L100 down, and all\\nexpenses paid?\" Mr. Whittington leaned back in his chair, and\\nthrust his thumbs into the arm-holes of his waistcoat.\\nTuppence eyed him warily.\\n\"And the nature of the work?\" she demanded.\\n\"Nominal--purely nominal. A pleasant trip, that is all.\"\\n\"Where to?\"\\nMr. Whittington smiled again.\\n\"Paris.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. To herself she said: \"Of\\ncourse, if father heard that he would have a fit! But somehow I\\ndon\\'t see Mr. Whittington in the role of the gay deceiver.\"\\n\"Yes,\" continued Whittington. \"What could be more delightful? To\\nput the clock back a few years--a very few, I am sure--and\\nre-enter one of those charming pensionnats de jeunes filles with\\nwhich Paris abounds----\"\\nTuppence interrupted him.\\n\"A pensionnat?\"\\n\"Exactly. Madame Colombier\\'s in the Avenue de Neuilly.\"\\nTuppence knew the name well. Nothing could have been more\\nselect. She had had several American friends there. She was more\\nthan ever puzzled.\\n\"You want me to go to Madame Colombier\\'s? For how long?\"\\n\"That depends. Possibly three months.\"\\n\"And that is all? There are no other conditions?\"\\n\"None whatever. You would, of course, go in the character of my\\nward, and you would hold no communication with your friends. I\\nshould have to request absolute secrecy for the time being. By\\nthe way, you are English, are you not?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Yet you speak with a slight American accent?\"\\n\"My great pal in hospital was a little American girl. I dare say\\nI picked it up from her. I can soon get out of it again.\"\\n\"On the contrary, it might be simpler for you to pass as an\\nAmerican. Details about your past life in England might be more\\ndifficult to sustain. Yes, I think that would be decidedly\\nbetter. Then----\"\\n\"One moment, Mr. Whittington! You seem to be taking my consent\\nfor granted.\"\\nWhittington looked surprised.\\n\"Surely you are not thinking of refusing? I can assure you that\\nMadame Colombier\\'s is a most high-class and orthodox\\nestablishment. And the terms are most liberal.\"\\n\"Exactly,\" said Tuppence. \"That\\'s just it. The terms are almost\\ntoo liberal, Mr. Whittington. I cannot see any way in which I\\ncan be worth that amount of money to you.\"\\n\"No?\" said Whittington softly. \"Well, I will tell you. I could\\ndoubtless obtain some one else for very much less. What I am\\nwilling to pay for is a young lady with sufficient intelligence\\nand presence of mind to sustain her part well, and also one who\\nwill have sufficient discretion not to ask too many questions.\"\\nTuppence smiled a little. She felt that Whittington had scored.\\n\"There\\'s another thing. So far there has been no mention of Mr.\\nBeresford. Where does he come in?\"\\n\"Mr. Beresford?\"\\n\"My partner,\" said Tuppence with dignity. \"You saw us together\\nyesterday.\"\\n\"Ah, yes. But I\\'m afraid we shan\\'t require his services.\"\\n\"Then it\\'s off!\" Tuppence rose. \"It\\'s both or neither.\\nSorry--but that\\'s how it is. Good morning, Mr. Whittington.\"\\n\"Wait a minute. Let us see if something can\\'t be managed. Sit\\ndown again, Miss----\" He paused interrogatively.\\nTuppence\\'s conscience gave her a passing twinge as she remembered\\nthe archdeacon. She seized hurriedly on the first name that came\\ninto her head.\\n\"Jane Finn,\" she said hastily; and then paused open-mouthed at\\nthe effect of those two simple words.\\nAll the geniality had faded out of Whittington\\'s face. It was\\npurple with rage, and the veins stood out on the forehead. And\\nbehind it all there lurked a sort of incredulous dismay. He\\nleaned forward and hissed savagely:\\n\"So that\\'s your little game, is it?\"\\nTuppence, though utterly taken aback, nevertheless kept her head.\\nShe had not the faintest comprehension of his meaning, but she\\nwas naturally quick-witted, and felt it imperative to \"keep her\\nend up\" as she phrased it.\\nWhittington went on:\\n\"Been playing with me, have you, all the time, like a cat and\\nmouse? Knew all the time what I wanted you for, but kept up the\\ncomedy. Is that it, eh?\" He was cooling down. The red colour\\nwas ebbing out of his face. He eyed her keenly. \"Who\\'s been\\nblabbing? Rita?\"\\nTuppence shook her head. She was doubtful as to how long she\\ncould sustain this illusion, but she realized the importance of\\nnot dragging an unknown Rita into it.\\n\"No,\" she replied with perfect truth. \"Rita knows nothing about\\nme.\"\\nHis eyes still bored into her like gimlets.\\n\"How much do you know?\" he shot out.\\n\"Very little indeed,\" answered Tuppence, and was pleased to note\\nthat Whittington\\'s uneasiness was augmented instead of allayed.\\nTo have boasted that she knew a lot might have raised doubts in\\nhis mind.\\n\"Anyway,\" snarled Whittington, \"you knew enough to come in here\\nand plump out that name.\"\\n\"It might be my own name,\" Tuppence pointed out.\\n\"It\\'s likely, isn\\'t it, then there would be two girls with a name\\nlike that?\"\\n\"Or I might just have hit upon it by chance,\" continued Tuppence,\\nintoxicated with the success of truthfulness.\\nMr. Whittington brought his fist down upon the desk with a bang.\\n\"Quit fooling! How much do you know? And how much do you want?\"\\nThe last five words took Tuppence\\'s fancy mightily, especially\\nafter a meagre breakfast and a supper of buns the night before.\\nHer present part was of the adventuress rather than the\\nadventurous order, but she did not deny its possibilities. She\\nsat up and smiled with the air of one who has the situation\\nthoroughly well in hand.\\n\"My dear Mr. Whittington,\" she said, \"let us by all means lay our\\ncards upon the table. And pray do not be so angry. You heard me\\nsay yesterday that I proposed to live by my wits. It seems to me\\nthat I have now proved I have some wits to live by! I admit I\\nhave knowledge of a certain name, but perhaps my knowledge ends\\nthere.\"\\n\"Yes--and perhaps it doesn\\'t,\" snarled Whittington.\\n\"You insist on misjudging me,\" said Tuppence, and sighed gently.\\n\"As I said once before,\" said Whittington angrily, \"quit fooling,\\nand come to the point. You can\\'t play the innocent with me. You\\nknow a great deal more than you\\'re willing to admit.\"\\nTuppence paused a moment to admire her own ingenuity, and then\\nsaid softly:\\n\"I shouldn\\'t like to contradict you, Mr. Whittington.\"\\n\"So we come to the usual question--how much?\"\\nTuppence was in a dilemma. So far she had fooled Whittington\\nwith complete success, but to mention a palpably impossible sum\\nmight awaken his suspicions. An idea flashed across her brain.\\n\"Suppose we say a little something down, and a fuller discussion\\nof the matter later?\"\\nWhittington gave her an ugly glance.\\n\"Blackmail, eh?\"\\nTuppence smiled sweetly.\\n\"Oh no! Shall we say payment of services in advance?\"\\nWhittington grunted.\\n\"You see,\" explained Tuppence still sweetly, \"I\\'m so very fond of\\nmoney!\"\\n\"You\\'re about the limit, that\\'s what you are,\" growled\\nWhittington, with a sort of unwilling admiration. \"You took me\\nin all right. Thought you were quite a meek little kid with just\\nenough brains for my purpose.\"\\n\"Life,\" moralized Tuppence, \"is full of surprises.\"\\n\"All the same,\" continued Whittington, \"some one\\'s been talking.\\nYou say it isn\\'t Rita. Was it----? Oh, come in.\"\\nThe clerk followed his discreet knock into the room, and laid a\\npaper at his master\\'s elbow.\\n\"Telephone message just come for you, sir.\"\\nWhittington snatched it up and read it. A frown gathered on his\\nbrow.\\n\"That\\'ll do, Brown. You can go.\"\\nThe clerk withdrew, closing the door behind him. Whittington\\nturned to Tuppence.\\n\"Come to-morrow at the same time. I\\'m busy now. Here\\'s fifty to\\ngo on with.\"\\nHe rapidly sorted out some notes, and pushed them across the\\ntable to Tuppence, then stood up, obviously impatient for her to\\ngo.\\nThe girl counted the notes in a businesslike manner, secured them\\nin her handbag, and rose.\\n\"Good morning, Mr. Whittington,\" she said politely. \"At least, au\\nrevoir, I should say.\"\\n\"Exactly. Au revoir!\" Whittington looked almost genial again, a\\nreversion that aroused in Tuppence a faint misgiving. \"Au revoir,\\nmy clever and charming young lady.\"\\nTuppence sped lightly down the stairs. A wild elation possessed\\nher. A neighbouring clock showed the time to be five minutes to\\ntwelve.\\n\"Let\\'s give Tommy a surprise!\" murmured Tuppence, and hailed a\\ntaxi.\\nThe cab drew up outside the tube station. Tommy was just within\\nthe entrance. His eyes opened to their fullest extent as he\\nhurried forward to assist Tuppence to alight. She smiled at him\\naffectionately, and remarked in a slightly affected voice:\\n\"Pay the thing, will you, old bean? I\\'ve got nothing smaller\\nthan a five-pound note!\"\\nCHAPTER III\\nA SET BACK\\nTHE moment was not quite so triumphant as it ought to have been.\\nTo begin with, the resources of Tommy\\'s pockets were somewhat\\nlimited. In the end the fare was managed, the lady recollecting a\\nplebeian twopence, and the driver, still holding the varied\\nassortment of coins in his hand, was prevailed upon to move on,\\nwhich he did after one last hoarse demand as to what the\\ngentleman thought he was giving him?\\n\"I think you\\'ve given him too much, Tommy,\" said Tuppence\\ninnocently. \"I fancy he wants to give some of it back.\"\\nIt was possibly this remark which induced the driver to move\\naway.\\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Beresford, at length able to relieve his\\nfeelings, \"what the--dickens, did you want to take a taxi for?\"\\n\"I was afraid I might be late and keep you waiting,\" said\\nTuppence gently.\\n\"Afraid--you--might--be--late! Oh, Lord, I give it up!\" said Mr.\\nBeresford.\\n\"And really and truly,\" continued Tuppence, opening her eyes very\\nwide, \"I haven\\'t got anything smaller than a five-pound note.\"\\n\"You did that part of it very well, old bean, but all the same\\nthe fellow wasn\\'t taken in--not for a moment!\"\\n\"No,\" said Tuppence thoughtfully, \"he didn\\'t believe it. That\\'s\\nthe curious part about speaking the truth. No one does believe\\nit. I found that out this morning. Now let\\'s go to lunch. How\\nabout the Savoy?\"\\nTommy grinned.\\n\"How about the Ritz?\"\\n\"On second thoughts, I prefer the Piccadilly. It\\'s nearer. We\\nshan\\'t have to take another taxi. Come along.\"\\n\"Is this a new brand of humour? Or is your brain really\\nunhinged?\" inquired Tommy.\\n\"Your last supposition is the correct one. I have come into\\nmoney, and the shock has been too much for me! For that\\nparticular form of mental trouble an eminent physician recommends\\nunlimited Hors d\\'oeuvre, Lobster a l\\'americane, Chicken Newberg,\\nand Peche Melba! Let\\'s go and get them!\"\\n\"Tuppence, old girl, what has really come over you?\"\\n\"Oh, unbelieving one!\" Tuppence wrenched open her bag. \"Look\\nhere, and here, and here!\"\\n\"Great Jehosaphat! My dear girl, don\\'t wave Fishers aloft like\\nthat!\"\\n\"They\\'re not Fishers. They\\'re five times better than Fishers,\\nand this one\\'s ten times better!\"\\nTommy groaned.\\n\"I must have been drinking unawares! Am I dreaming, Tuppence, or\\ndo I really behold a large quantity of five-pound notes being\\nwaved about in a dangerous fashion?\"\\n\"Even so, O King! Now, will you come and have lunch?\"\\n\"I\\'ll come anywhere. But what have you been doing? Holding up a\\nbank?\"\\n\"All in good time. What an awful place Piccadilly Circus is.\\nThere\\'s a huge bus bearing down on us. It would be too terrible\\nif they killed the five-pound notes!\"\\n\"Grill room?\" inquired Tommy, as they reached the opposite\\npavement in safety.\\n\"The other\\'s more expensive,\" demurred Tuppence.\\n\"That\\'s mere wicked wanton extravagance. Come on below.\"\\n\"Are you sure I can get all the things I want there?\"\\n\"That extremely unwholesome menu you were outlining just now? Of\\ncourse you can--or as much as is good for you, anyway.\"\\n\"And now tell me,\" said Tommy, unable to restrain his pent-up\\ncuriosity any longer, as they sat in state surrounded by the many\\nhors d\\'oeuvre of Tuppence\\'s dreams.\\nMiss Cowley told him.\\n\"And the curious part of it is,\" she ended, \"that I really did\\ninvent the name of Jane Finn! I didn\\'t want to give my own\\nbecause of poor father--in case I should get mixed up in anything\\nshady.\"\\n\"Perhaps that\\'s so,\" said Tommy slowly. \"But you didn\\'t invent\\nit.\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"No. I told it to you. Don\\'t you remember, I said yesterday I\\'d\\noverheard two people talking about a female called Jane Finn?\\nThat\\'s what brought the name into your mind so pat.\"\\n\"So you did. I remember now. How extraordinary----\" Tuppence\\ntailed off into silence. Suddenly she aroused herself. \"Tommy!\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"What were they like, the two men you passed?\"\\nTommy frowned in an effort at remembrance.\\n\"One was a big fat sort of chap. Clean shaven, I think--and\\ndark.\"\\n\"That\\'s him,\" cried Tuppence, in an ungrammatical squeal. \"That\\'s\\nWhittington! What was the other man like?\"\\n\"I can\\'t remember. I didn\\'t notice him particularly. It was\\nreally the outlandish name that caught my attention.\"\\n\"And people say that coincidences don\\'t happen!\" Tuppence tackled\\nher Peche Melba happily.\\nBut Tommy had become serious.\\n\"Look here, Tuppence, old girl, what is this going to lead to?\"\\n\"More money,\" replied his companion.\\n\"I know that. You\\'ve only got one idea in your head. What I mean\\nis, what about the next step? How are you going to keep the game\\nup?\"\\n\"Oh!\" Tuppence laid down her spoon. \"You\\'re right, Tommy, it is\\na bit of a poser.\"\\n\"After all, you know, you can\\'t bluff him forever. You\\'re sure to\\nslip up sooner or later. And, anyway, I\\'m not at all sure that\\nit isn\\'t actionable--blackmail, you know.\"\\n\"Nonsense. Blackmail is saying you\\'ll tell unless you are given\\nmoney. Now, there\\'s nothing I could tell, because I don\\'t really\\nknow anything.\"\\n\"Hm,\" said Tommy doubtfully. \"Well, anyway, what ARE we going to\\ndo? Whittington was in a hurry to get rid of you this morning,\\nbut next time he\\'ll want to know something more before he parts\\nwith his money. He\\'ll want to know how much YOU know, and where\\nyou got your information from, and a lot of other things that you\\ncan\\'t cope with. What are you going to do about it?\"\\nTuppence frowned severely.\\n\"We must think. Order some Turkish coffee, Tommy. Stimulating\\nto the brain. Oh, dear, what a lot I have eaten!\"\\n\"You have made rather a hog of yourself! So have I for that\\nmatter, but I flatter myself that my choice of dishes was more\\njudicious than yours. Two coffees.\" (This was to the waiter.)\\n\"One Turkish, one French.\"\\nTuppence sipped her coffee with a deeply reflective air, and\\nsnubbed Tommy when he spoke to her.\\n\"Be quiet. I\\'m thinking.\"\\n\"Shades of Pelmanism!\" said Tommy, and relapsed into silence.\\n\"There!\" said Tuppence at last. \"I\\'ve got a plan. Obviously what\\nwe\\'ve got to do is to find out more about it all.\"\\nTommy applauded.\\n\"Don\\'t jeer. We can only find out through Whittington. We must\\ndiscover where he lives, what he does--sleuth him, in fact! Now I\\ncan\\'t do it, because he knows me, but he only saw you for a\\nminute or two in Lyons\\'. He\\'s not likely to recognize you. After\\nall, one young man is much like another.\"\\n\"I repudiate that remark utterly. I\\'m sure my pleasing features\\nand distinguished appearance would single me out from any crowd.\"\\n\"My plan is this,\" Tuppence went on calmly, \"I\\'ll go alone\\nto-morrow. I\\'ll put him off again like I did to-day. It doesn\\'t\\nmatter if I don\\'t get any more money at once. Fifty pounds ought\\nto last us a few days.\"\\n\"Or even longer!\"\\n\"You\\'ll hang about outside. When I come out I shan\\'t speak to\\nyou in case he\\'s watching. But I\\'ll take up my stand somewhere\\nnear, and when he comes out of the building I\\'ll drop a\\nhandkerchief or something, and off you go!\"\\n\"Off I go where?\"\\n\"Follow him, of course, silly! What do you think of the idea?\"\\n\"Sort of thing one reads about in books. I somehow feel that in\\nreal life one will feel a bit of an ass standing in the street\\nfor hours with nothing to do. People will wonder what I\\'m up\\nto.\"\\n\"Not in the city. Every one\\'s in such a hurry. Probably no one\\nwill even notice you at all.\"\\n\"That\\'s the second time you\\'ve made that sort of remark. Never\\nmind, I forgive you. Anyway, it will be rather a lark. What are\\nyou doing this afternoon?\"\\n\"Well,\" said Tuppence meditatively. \"I HAD thought of hats! Or\\nperhaps silk stockings! Or perhaps----\"\\n\"Hold hard,\" admonished Tommy. \"There\\'s a limit to fifty pounds!\\nBut let\\'s do dinner and a show to-night at all events.\"\\n\"Rather.\"\\nThe day passed pleasantly. The evening even more so. Two of the\\nfive-pound notes were now irretrievably dead.\\nThey met by arrangement the following morning and proceeded\\ncitywards. Tommy remained on the opposite side of the road while\\nTuppence plunged into the building.\\nTommy strolled slowly down to the end of the street, then back\\nagain. Just as he came abreast of the building, Tuppence darted\\nacross the road.\\n\"Tommy!\"\\n\"Yes. What\\'s up?\"\\n\"The place is shut. I can\\'t make anyone hear.\"\\n\"That\\'s odd.\"\\n\"Isn\\'t it? Come up with me, and let\\'s try again.\"\\nTommy followed her. As they passed the third floor landing a\\nyoung clerk came out of an office. He hesitated a moment, then\\naddressed himself to Tuppence.\\n\"Were you wanting the Esthonia Glassware?\"\\n\"Yes, please.\"\\n\"It\\'s closed down. Since yesterday afternoon. Company being\\nwound up, they say. Not that I\\'ve ever heard of it myself. But\\nanyway the office is to let.\"\\n\"Th--thank you,\" faltered Tuppence. \"I suppose you don\\'t know\\nMr. Whittington\\'s address?\"\\n\"Afraid I don\\'t. They left rather suddenly.\"\\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Tommy. \"Come on, Tuppence.\"\\nThey descended to the street again where they gazed at one\\nanother blankly.\\n\"That\\'s torn it,\" said Tommy at length.\\n\"And I never suspected it,\" wailed Tuppence.\\n\"Cheer up, old thing, it can\\'t be helped.\"\\n\"Can\\'t it, though!\" Tuppence\\'s little chin shot out defiantly.\\n\"Do you think this is the end? If so, you\\'re wrong. It\\'s just\\nthe beginning!\"\\n\"The beginning of what?\"\\n\"Of our adventure! Tommy, don\\'t you see, if they are scared\\nenough to run away like this, it shows that there must be a lot\\nin this Jane Finn business! Well, we\\'ll get to the bottom of it.\\nWe\\'ll run them down! We\\'ll be sleuths in earnest!\"\\n\"Yes, but there\\'s no one left to sleuth.\"\\n\"No, that\\'s why we\\'ll have to start all over again. Lend me that\\nbit of pencil. Thanks. Wait a minute--don\\'t interrupt. There!\"\\nTuppence handed back the pencil, and surveyed the piece of paper\\non which she had written with a satisfied eye:\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\n\"Advertisement.\"\\n\"You\\'re not going to put that thing in after all?\"\\n\"No, it\\'s a different one.\" She handed him the slip of paper.\\nTommy read the words on it aloud:\\n\"WANTED, any information respecting Jane Finn. Apply Y.A.\"\\nCHAPTER IV\\nWHO IS JANE FINN?\\nTHE next day passed slowly. It was necessary to curtail\\nexpenditure. Carefully husbanded, forty pounds will last a long\\ntime. Luckily the weather was fine, and \"walking is cheap,\"\\ndictated Tuppence. An outlying picture house provided them with\\nrecreation for the evening.\\nThe day of disillusionment had been a Wednesday. On Thursday the\\nadvertisement had duly appeared. On Friday letters might be\\nexpected to arrive at Tommy\\'s rooms.\\nHe had been bound by an honourable promise not to open any such\\nletters if they did arrive, but to repair to the National\\nGallery, where his colleague would meet him at ten o\\'clock.\\nTuppence was first at the rendezvous. She ensconced herself on a\\nred velvet seat, and gazed at the Turners with unseeing eyes\\nuntil she saw the familiar figure enter the room.\\n\"Well?\"\\n\"Well,\" returned Mr. Beresford provokingly. \"Which is your\\nfavourite picture?\"\\n\"Don\\'t be a wretch. Aren\\'t there ANY answers?\"\\nTommy shook his head with a deep and somewhat overacted\\nmelancholy.\\n\"I didn\\'t want to disappoint you, old thing, by telling you right\\noff. It\\'s too bad. Good money wasted.\" He sighed. \"Still,\\nthere it is. The advertisement has appeared, and--there are only\\ntwo answers!\"\\n\"Tommy, you devil!\" almost screamed Tuppence. \"Give them to me.\\nHow could you be so mean!\"\\n\"Your language, Tuppence, your language! They\\'re very particular\\nat the National Gallery. Government show, you know. And do\\nremember, as I have pointed out to you before, that as a\\nclergyman\\'s daughter----\"\\n\"I ought to be on the stage!\" finished Tuppence with a snap.\\n\"That is not what I intended to say. But if you are sure that\\nyou have enjoyed to the full the reaction of joy after despair\\nwith which I have kindly provided you free of charge, let us get\\ndown to our mail, as the saying goes.\"\\nTuppence snatched the two precious envelopes from him\\nunceremoniously, and scrutinized them carefully.\\n\"Thick paper, this one. It looks rich. We\\'ll keep it to the\\nlast and open the other first.\"\\n\"Right you are. One, two, three, go!\"\\nTuppence\\'s little thumb ripped open the envelope, and she\\nextracted the contents.\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\n\"Referring to your advertisement in this morning\\'s paper, I may\\nbe able to be of some use to you. Perhaps you could call and see\\nme at the above address at eleven o\\'clock to-morrow morning.\\n\"Yours truly,\\n\"A. CARTER.\\n\"27 Carshalton Gardens,\" said Tuppence, referring to the address.\\n\"That\\'s Gloucester Road way. Plenty of time to get there if we\\ntube.\"\\n\"The following,\" said Tommy, \"is the plan of campaign. It is my\\nturn to assume the offensive. Ushered into the presence of Mr.\\nCarter, he and I wish each other good morning as is customary. He\\nthen says: \\'Please take a seat, Mr.--er?\\' To which I reply\\npromptly and significantly: \\'Edward Whittington!\\' whereupon Mr.\\nCarter turns purple in the face and gasps out: \\'How much?\\'\\nPocketing the usual fee of fifty pounds, I rejoin you in the road\\noutside, and we proceed to the next address and repeat the\\nperformance.\"\\n\"Don\\'t be absurd, Tommy. Now for the other letter. Oh, this is\\nfrom the Ritz!\"\\n\"A hundred pounds instead of fifty!\"\\n\"I\\'ll read it:\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\n\"Re your advertisement, I should be glad if you would call round\\nsomewhere about lunch-time.\\n\"Yours truly,\\n\"JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER.\"\\n\"Ha!\" said Tommy. \"Do I smell a Boche? Or only an American\\nmillionaire of unfortunate ancestry? At all events we\\'ll call at\\nlunch-time. It\\'s a good time--frequently leads to free food for\\ntwo.\"\\nTuppence nodded assent.\\n\"Now for Carter. We\\'ll have to hurry.\"\\nCarshalton Terrace proved to be an unimpeachable row of what\\nTuppence called \"ladylike looking houses.\" They rang the bell at\\nNo. 27, and a neat maid answered the door. She looked so\\nrespectable that Tuppence\\'s heart sank. Upon Tommy\\'s request for\\nMr. Carter, she showed them into a small study on the ground\\nfloor where she left them. Hardly a minute elapsed, however,\\nbefore the door opened, and a tall man with a lean hawklike face\\nand a tired manner entered the room.\\n\"Mr. Y. A.?\" he said, and smiled. His smile was distinctly\\nattractive. \"Do sit down, both of you.\"\\nThey obeyed. He himself took a chair opposite to Tuppence and\\nsmiled at her encouragingly. There was something in the quality\\nof his smile that made the girl\\'s usual readiness desert her.\\nAs he did not seem inclined to open the conversation, Tuppence\\nwas forced to begin.\\n\"We wanted to know--that is, would you be so kind as to tell us\\nanything you know about Jane Finn?\"\\n\"Jane Finn? Ah!\" Mr. Carter appeared to reflect. \"Well, the\\nquestion is, what do you know about her?\"\\nTuppence drew herself up.\\n\"I don\\'t see that that\\'s got anything to do with it.\"\\n\"No? But it has, you know, really it has.\" He smiled again in\\nhis tired way, and continued reflectively. \"So that brings us\\ndown to it again. What do you know about Jane Finn?\\n\"Come now,\" he continued, as Tuppence remained silent. \"You must\\nknow SOMETHING to have advertised as you did?\" He leaned forward\\na little, his weary voice held a hint of persuasiveness. \"Suppose\\nyou tell me . . .\"\\nThere was something very magnetic about Mr. Carter\\'s personality.\\nTuppence seemed to shake herself free of it with an effort, as\\nshe said:\\n\"We couldn\\'t do that, could we, Tommy?\"\\nBut to her surprise, her companion did not back her up. His eyes\\nwere fixed on Mr. Carter, and his tone when he spoke held an\\nunusual note of deference.\\n\"I dare say the little we know won\\'t be any good to you, sir. But\\nsuch as it is, you\\'re welcome to it.\"\\n\"Tommy!\" cried out Tuppence in surprise.\\nMr. Carter slewed round in his chair. His eyes asked a question.\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"Yes, sir, I recognized you at once. Saw you in France when I\\nwas with the Intelligence. As soon as you came into the room, I\\nknew----\"\\nMr. Carter held up his hand.\\n\"No names, please. I\\'m known as Mr. Carter here. It\\'s my\\ncousin\\'s house, by the way. She\\'s willing to lend it to me\\nsometimes when it\\'s a case of working on strictly unofficial\\nlines. Well, now\"--he looked from one to the other--\"who\\'s going\\nto tell me the story?\"\\n\"Fire ahead, Tuppence,\" directed Tommy. \"It\\'s your yarn.\"\\n\"Yes, little lady, out with it.\"\\nAnd obediently Tuppence did out with it, telling the whole story\\nfrom the forming of the Young Adventurers, Ltd., downwards.\\nMr. Carter listened in silence with a resumption of his tired\\nmanner. Now and then he passed his hand across his lips as though\\nto hide a smile. When she had finished he nodded gravely.\\n\"Not much. But suggestive. Quite suggestive. If you\\'ll excuse\\nmy saying so, you\\'re a curious young couple. I don\\'t know--you\\nmight succeed where others have failed . . . I believe in luck,\\nyou know--always have....\"\\nHe paused a moment, and then went on.\\n\"Well, how about it? You\\'re out for adventure. How would you\\nlike to work for me? All quite unofficial, you know. Expenses\\npaid, and a moderate screw?\"\\nTuppence gazed at him, her lips parted, her eyes growing wider\\nand wider.\\n\"What should we have to do?\" she breathed.\\nMr. Carter smiled.\\n\"Just go on with what you\\'re doing now. FIND JANE FINN.\"\\n\"Yes, but--who IS Jane Finn?\"\\nMr. Carter nodded gravely.\\n\"Yes, you\\'re entitled to know that, I think.\"\\nHe leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs, brought the tips\\nof his fingers together, and began in a low monotone:\\n\"Secret diplomacy (which, by the way, is nearly always bad\\npolicy!) does not concern you. It will be sufficient to say that\\nin the early days of 1915 a certain document came into being. It\\nwas the draft of a secret agreement--treaty--call it what you\\nlike. It was drawn up ready for signature by the various\\nrepresentatives, and drawn up in America--at that time a neutral\\ncountry. It was dispatched to England by a special messenger\\nselected for that purpose, a young fellow called Danvers. It was\\nhoped that the whole affair had been kept so secret that nothing\\nwould have leaked out. That kind of hope is usually\\ndisappointed. Somebody always talks!\\n\"Danvers sailed for England on the Lusitania. He carried the\\nprecious papers in an oilskin packet which he wore next his skin.\\nIt was on that particular voyage that the Lusitania was torpedoed\\nand sunk. Danvers was among the list of those missing.\\nEventually his body was washed ashore, and identified beyond any\\npossible doubt. But the oilskin packet was missing!\\n\"The question was, had it been taken from him, or had he himself\\npassed it on into another\\'s keeping? There were a few incidents\\nthat strengthened the possibility of the latter theory. After the\\ntorpedo struck the ship, in the few moments during the launching\\nof the boats, Danvers was seen speaking to a young American girl.\\nNo one actually saw him pass anything to her, but he might have\\ndone so. It seems to me quite likely that he entrusted the papers\\nto this girl, believing that she, as a woman, had a greater\\nchance of bringing them safely to shore.\\n\"But if so, where was the girl, and what had she done with the\\npapers? By later advice from America it seemed likely that\\nDanvers had been closely shadowed on the way over. Was this girl\\nin league with his enemies? Or had she, in her turn, been\\nshadowed and either tricked or forced into handing over the\\nprecious packet?\\n\"We set to work to trace her out. It proved unexpectedly\\ndifficult. Her name was Jane Finn, and it duly appeared among the\\nlist of the survivors, but the girl herself seemed to have\\nvanished completely. Inquiries into her antecedents did little to\\nhelp us. She was an orphan, and had been what we should call\\nover here a pupil teacher in a small school out West. Her\\npassport had been made out for Paris, where she was going to join\\nthe staff of a hospital. She had offered her services\\nvoluntarily, and after some correspondence they had been\\naccepted. Having seen her name in the list of the saved from the\\nLusitania, the staff of the hospital were naturally very\\nsurprised at her not arriving to take up her billet, and at not\\nhearing from her in any way.\\n\"Well, every effort was made to trace the young lady--but all in\\nvain. We tracked her across Ireland, but nothing could be heard\\nof her after she set foot in England. No use was made of the\\ndraft treaty--as might very easily have been done--and we\\ntherefore came to the conclusion that Danvers had, after all,\\ndestroyed it. The war entered on another phase, the diplomatic\\naspect changed accordingly, and the treaty was never redrafted.\\nRumours as to its existence were emphatically denied. The\\ndisappearance of Jane Finn was forgotten and the whole affair was\\nlost in oblivion.\"\\nMr. Carter paused, and Tuppence broke in impatiently:\\n\"But why has it all cropped up again? The war\\'s over.\"\\nA hint of alertness came into Mr. Carter\\'s manner.\\n\"Because it seems that the papers were not destroyed after all,\\nand that they might be resurrected to-day with a new and deadly\\nsignificance.\"\\nTuppence stared. Mr. Carter nodded.\\n\"Yes, five years ago, that draft treaty was a weapon in our\\nhands; to-day it is a weapon against us. It was a gigantic\\nblunder. If its terms were made public, it would mean\\ndisaster.... It might possibly bring about another war--not with\\nGermany this time! That is an extreme possibility, and I do not\\nbelieve in its likelihood myself, but that document undoubtedly\\nimplicates a number of our statesmen whom we cannot afford to\\nhave discredited in any way at the present moment. As a party\\ncry for Labour it would be irresistible, and a Labour Government\\nat this juncture would, in my opinion, be a grave disability for\\nBritish trade, but that is a mere nothing to the REAL danger.\"\\nHe paused, and then said quietly:\\n\"You may perhaps have heard or read that there is Bolshevist\\ninfluence at work behind the present Labour unrest?\"\\nTuppence nodded.\\n\"That is the truth. Bolshevist gold is pouring into this country\\nfor the specific purpose of procuring a Revolution. And there is\\na certain man, a man whose real name is unknown to us, who is\\nworking in the dark for his own ends. The Bolshevists are behind\\nthe Labour unrest--but this man is BEHIND THE BOLSHEVISTS. Who\\nis he? We do not know. He is always spoken of by the unassuming\\ntitle of \\'Mr. Brown.\\' But one thing is certain, he is the master\\ncriminal of this age. He controls a marvellous organization.\\nMost of the Peace propaganda during the war was originated and\\nfinanced by him. His spies are everywhere.\"\\n\"A naturalized German?\" asked Tommy.\\n\"On the contrary, I have every reason to believe he is an\\nEnglishman. He was pro-German, as he would have been pro-Boer.\\nWhat he seeks to attain we do not know--probably supreme power\\nfor himself, of a kind unique in history. We have no clue as to\\nhis real personality. It is reported that even his own followers\\nare ignorant of it. Where we have come across his tracks, he has\\nalways played a secondary part. Somebody else assumes the chief\\nrole. But afterwards we always find that there has been some\\nnonentity, a servant or a clerk, who has remained in the\\nbackground unnoticed, and that the elusive Mr. Brown has escaped\\nus once more.\"\\n\"Oh!\" Tuppence jumped. \"I wonder----\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"I remember in Mr. Whittington\\'s office. The clerk--he called\\nhim Brown. You don\\'t think----\"\\nCarter nodded thoughtfully.\\n\"Very likely. A curious point is that the name is usually\\nmentioned. An idiosyncrasy of genius. Can you describe him at\\nall?\"\\n\"I really didn\\'t notice. He was quite ordinary--just like anyone\\nelse.\"\\nMr. Carter sighed in his tired manner.\\n\"That is the invariable description of Mr. Brown! Brought a\\ntelephone message to the man Whittington, did he? Notice a\\ntelephone in the outer office?\"\\nTuppence thought.\\n\"No, I don\\'t think I did.\"\\n\"Exactly. That \\'message\\' was Mr. Brown\\'s way of giving an order\\nto his subordinate. He overheard the whole conversation of\\ncourse. Was it after that that Whittington handed you over the\\nmoney, and told you to come the following day?\"\\nTuppence nodded.\\n\"Yes, undoubtedly the hand of Mr. Brown!\" Mr. Carter paused.\\n\"Well, there it is, you see what you are pitting yourselves\\nagainst? Possibly the finest criminal brain of the age. I don\\'t\\nquite like it, you know. You\\'re such young things, both of you.\\nI shouldn\\'t like anything to happen to you.\"\\n\"It won\\'t,\" Tuppence assured him positively.\\n\"I\\'ll look after her, sir,\" said Tommy.\\n\"And I\\'ll look after YOU,\" retorted Tuppence, resenting the manly\\nassertion.\\n\"Well, then, look after each other,\" said Mr. Carter, smiling.\\n\"Now let\\'s get back to business. There\\'s something mysterious\\nabout this draft treaty that we haven\\'t fathomed yet. We\\'ve been\\nthreatened with it--in plain and unmistakable terms. The\\nRevolutionary element as good as declare that it\\'s in their\\nhands, and that they intend to produce it at a given moment. On\\nthe other hand, they are clearly at fault about many of its\\nprovisions. The Government consider it as mere bluff on their\\npart, and, rightly or wrongly, have stuck to the policy of\\nabsolute denial. I\\'m not so sure. There have been hints,\\nindiscreet allusions, that seem to indicate that the menace is a\\nreal one. The position is much as though they had got hold of an\\nincriminating document, but couldn\\'t read it because it was in\\ncipher--but we know that the draft treaty wasn\\'t in\\ncipher--couldn\\'t be in the nature of things--so that won\\'t wash.\\nBut there\\'s SOMETHING. Of course, Jane Finn may be dead for all\\nwe know--but I don\\'t think so. The curious thing is that THEY\\'RE\\nTRYING TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE GIRL FROM US\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"Yes. One or two little things have cropped up. And your story,\\nlittle lady, confirms my idea. They know we\\'re looking for Jane\\nFinn. Well, they\\'ll produce a Jane Finn of their own--say at a\\npensionnat in Paris.\" Tuppence gasped, and Mr. Carter smiled.\\n\"No one knows in the least what she looks like, so that\\'s all\\nright. She\\'s primed with a trumped-up tale, and her real business\\nis to get as much information as possible out of us. See the\\nidea?\"\\n\"Then you think\"--Tuppence paused to grasp the supposition\\nfully--\"that it WAS as Jane Finn that they wanted me to go to\\nParis?\"\\nMr. Carter smiled more wearily than ever.\\n\"I believe in coincidences, you know,\" he said.\\nCHAPTER V\\nMR. JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER\\n\"WELL,\" said Tuppence, recovering herself, \"it really seems as\\nthough it were meant to be.\"\\nCarter nodded.\\n\"I know what you mean. I\\'m superstitious myself. Luck, and all\\nthat sort of thing. Fate seems to have chosen you out to be\\nmixed up in this.\"\\nTommy indulged in a chuckle.\\n\"My word! I don\\'t wonder Whittington got the wind up when\\nTuppence plumped out that name! I should have myself. But look\\nhere, sir, we\\'re taking up an awful lot of your time. Have you\\nany tips to give us before we clear out?\"\\n\"I think not. My experts, working in stereotyped ways, have\\nfailed. You will bring imagination and an open mind to the task.\\nDon\\'t be discouraged if that too does not succeed. For one thing\\nthere is a likelihood of the pace being forced.\"\\nTuppence frowned uncomprehendingly.\\n\"When you had that interview with Whittington, they had time\\nbefore them. I have information that the big coup was planned for\\nearly in the new year. But the Government is contemplating\\nlegislative action which will deal effectually with the strike\\nmenace. They\\'ll get wind of it soon, if they haven\\'t already,\\nand it\\'s possible that that may bring things to a head. I hope it\\nwill myself. The less time they have to mature their plans the\\nbetter. I\\'m just warning you that you haven\\'t much time before\\nyou, and that you needn\\'t be cast down if you fail. It\\'s not an\\neasy proposition anyway. That\\'s all.\"\\nTuppence rose.\\n\"I think we ought to be businesslike. What exactly can we count\\nupon you for, Mr. Carter?\" Mr. Carter\\'s lips twitched slightly,\\nbut he replied succinctly: \"Funds within reason, detailed\\ninformation on any point, and NO OFFICIAL RECOGNITION. I mean\\nthat if you get yourselves into trouble with the police, I can\\'t\\nofficially help you out of it. You\\'re on your own.\"\\nTuppence nodded sagely.\\n\"I quite understand that. I\\'ll write out a list of the things I\\nwant to know when I\\'ve had time to think. Now--about money----\"\\n\"Yes, Miss Tuppence. Do you want to say how much?\"\\n\"Not exactly. We\\'ve got plenty to go with for the present, but\\nwhen we want more----\"\\n\"It will be waiting for you.\"\\n\"Yes, but--I\\'m sure I don\\'t want to be rude about the Government\\nif you\\'ve got anything to do with it, but you know one really has\\nthe devil of a time getting anything out of it! And if we have to\\nfill up a blue form and send it in, and then, after three months,\\nthey send us a green one, and so on--well, that won\\'t be much\\nuse, will it?\"\\nMr. Carter laughed outright.\\n\"Don\\'t worry, Miss Tuppence. You will send a personal demand to\\nme here, and the money, in notes, shall be sent by return of\\npost. As to salary, shall we say at the rate of three hundred a\\nyear? And an equal sum for Mr. Beresford, of course.\"\\nTuppence beamed upon him.\\n\"How lovely. You are kind. I do love money! I\\'ll keep\\nbeautiful accounts of our expenses all debit and credit, and the\\nbalance on the right side, and red line drawn sideways with the\\ntotals the same at the bottom. I really know how to do it when I\\nthink.\"\\n\"I\\'m sure you do. Well, good-bye, and good luck to you both.\"\\nHe shook hands with them, and in another minute they were\\ndescending the steps of 27 Carshalton Terrace with their heads in\\na whirl.\\n\"Tommy! Tell me at once, who is \\'Mr. Carter\\'?\"\\nTommy murmured a name in her ear.\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence, impressed.\\n\"And I can tell you, old bean, he\\'s IT!\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence again. Then she added reflectively,\\n\"I like him, don\\'t you? He looks so awfully tired and bored, and\\nyet you feel that underneath he\\'s just like steel, all keen and\\nflashing. Oh!\" She gave a skip. \"Pinch me, Tommy, do pinch me.\\nI can\\'t believe it\\'s real!\"\\nMr. Beresford obliged.\\n\"Ow! That\\'s enough! Yes, we\\'re not dreaming. We\\'ve got a job!\"\\n\"And what a job! The joint venture has really begun.\"\\n\"It\\'s more respectable than I thought it would be,\" said Tuppence\\nthoughtfully.\\n\"Luckily I haven\\'t got your craving for crime! What time is it?\\nLet\\'s have lunch--oh!\"\\nThe same thought sprang to the minds of each. Tommy voiced it\\nfirst.\\n\"Julius P. Hersheimmer!\"\\n\"We never told Mr. Carter about hearing from him.\"\\n\"Well, there wasn\\'t much to tell--not till we\\'ve seen him. Come\\non, we\\'d better take a taxi.\"\\n\"Now who\\'s being extravagant?\"\\n\"All expenses paid, remember. Hop in.\"\\n\"At any rate, we shall make a better effect arriving this way,\"\\nsaid Tuppence, leaning back luxuriously. \"I\\'m sure blackmailers\\nnever arrive in buses!\"\\n\"We\\'ve ceased being blackmailers,\" Tommy pointed out.\\n\"I\\'m not sure I have,\" said Tuppence darkly.\\nOn inquiring for Mr. Hersheimmer, they were at once taken up to\\nhis suite. An impatient voice cried \"Come in\" in answer to the\\npage-boy\\'s knock, and the lad stood aside to let them pass in.\\nMr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was a great deal younger than either\\nTommy or Tuppence had pictured him. The girl put him down as\\nthirty-five. He was of middle height, and squarely built to match\\nhis jaw. His face was pugnacious but pleasant. No one could have\\nmistaken him for anything but an American, though he spoke with\\nvery little accent.\\n\"Get my note? Sit down and tell me right away all you know about\\nmy cousin.\"\\n\"Your cousin?\"\\n\"Sure thing. Jane Finn.\"\\n\"Is she your cousin?\"\\n\"My father and her mother were brother and sister,\" explained Mr.\\nHersheimmer meticulously.\\n\"Oh!\" cried Tuppence. \"Then you know where she is?\"\\n\"No!\" Mr. Hersheimmer brought down his fist with a bang on the\\ntable. \"I\\'m darned if I do! Don\\'t you?\"\\n\"We advertised to receive information, not to give it,\" said\\nTuppence severely.\\n\"I guess I know that. I can read. But I thought maybe it was\\nher back history you were after, and that you\\'d know where she\\nwas now?\"\\n\"Well, we wouldn\\'t mind hearing her back history,\" said Tuppence\\nguardedly.\\nBut Mr. Hersheimmer seemed to grow suddenly suspicious.\\n\"See here,\" he declared. \"This isn\\'t Sicily! No demanding\\nransom or threatening to crop her ears if I refuse. These are the\\nBritish Isles, so quit the funny business, or I\\'ll just sing out\\nfor that beautiful big British policeman I see out there in\\nPiccadilly.\"\\nTommy hastened to explain.\\n\"We haven\\'t kidnapped your cousin. On the contrary, we\\'re trying\\nto find her. We\\'re employed to do so.\"\\nMr. Hersheimmer leant back in his chair.\\n\"Put me wise,\" he said succinctly.\\nTommy fell in with this demand in so far as he gave him a guarded\\nversion of the disappearance of Jane Finn, and of the possibility\\nof her having been mixed up unawares in \"some political show.\" He\\nalluded to Tuppence and himself as \"private inquiry agents\"\\ncommissioned to find her, and added that they would therefore be\\nglad of any details Mr. Hersheimmer could give them.\\nThat gentleman nodded approval.\\n\"I guess that\\'s all right. I was just a mite hasty. But London\\ngets my goat! I only know little old New York. Just trot out\\nyour questions and I\\'ll answer.\"\\nFor the moment this paralysed the Young Adventurers, but\\nTuppence, recovering herself, plunged boldly into the breach with\\na reminiscence culled from detective fiction.\\n\"When did you last see the dece--your cousin, I mean?\"\\n\"Never seen her,\" responded Mr. Hersheimmer.\\n\"What?\" demanded Tommy, astonished.\\nHersheimmer turned to him.\\n\"No, sir. As I said before, my father and her mother were\\nbrother and sister, just as you might be\"--Tommy did not correct\\nthis view of their relationship--\"but they didn\\'t always get on\\ntogether. And when my aunt made up her mind to marry Amos Finn,\\nwho was a poor school teacher out West, my father was just mad!\\nSaid if he made his pile, as he seemed in a fair way to do, she\\'d\\nnever see a cent of it. Well, the upshot was that Aunt Jane went\\nout West and we never heard from her again.\\n\"The old man DID pile it up. He went into oil, and he went into\\nsteel, and he played a bit with railroads, and I can tell you he\\nmade Wall Street sit up!\" He paused. \"Then he died--last\\nfall--and I got the dollars. Well, would you believe it, my\\nconscience got busy! Kept knocking me up and saying: What\\nabour{sic} your Aunt Jane, way out West? It worried me some. You\\nsee, I figured it out that Amos Finn would never make good. He\\nwasn\\'t the sort. End of it was, I hired a man to hunt her down.\\nResult, she was dead, and Amos Finn was dead, but they\\'d left a\\ndaughter--Jane--who\\'d been torpedoed in the Lusitania on her way\\nto Paris. She was saved all right, but they didn\\'t seem able to\\nhear of her over this side. I guessed they weren\\'t hustling any,\\nso I thought I\\'d come along over, and speed things up. I phoned\\nScotland Yard and the Admiralty first thing. The Admiralty\\nrather choked me off, but Scotland Yard were very civil--said\\nthey would make inquiries, even sent a man round this morning to\\nget her photograph. I\\'m off to Paris to-morrow, just to see what\\nthe Prefecture is doing. I guess if I go to and fro hustling\\nthem, they ought to get busy!\"\\nThe energy of Mr. Hersheimmer was tremendous. They bowed before\\nit.\\n\"But say now,\" he ended, \"you\\'re not after her for anything?\\nContempt of court, or something British? A proud-spirited young\\nAmerican girl might find your rules and regulations in war time\\nrather irksome, and get up against it. If that\\'s the case, and\\nthere\\'s such a thing as graft in this country, I\\'ll buy her off.\"\\nTuppence reassured him.\\n\"That\\'s good. Then we can work together. What about some lunch?\\nShall we have it up here, or go down to the restaurant?\"\\nTuppence expressed a preference for the latter, and Julius bowed\\nto her decision.\\nOysters had just given place to Sole Colbert when a card was\\nbrought to Hersheimmer.\\n\"Inspector Japp, C.I.D. Scotland Yard again. Another man this\\ntime. What does he expect I can tell him that I didn\\'t tell the\\nfirst chap? I hope they haven\\'t lost that photograph. That\\nWestern photographer\\'s place was burned down and all his\\nnegatives destroyed--this is the only copy in existence. I got it\\nfrom the principal of the college there.\"\\nAn unformulated dread swept over Tuppence.\\n\"You--you don\\'t know the name of the man who came this morning?\"\\n\"Yes, I do. No, I don\\'t. Half a second. It was on his card.\\nOh, I know! Inspector Brown. Quiet, unassuming sort of chap.\"\\nCHAPTER VI\\nA PLAN OF CAMPAIGN\\nA veil might with profit be drawn over the events of the next\\nhalf-hour. Suffice it to say that no such person as \"Inspector\\nBrown\" was known to Scotland Yard. The photograph of Jane Finn,\\nwhich would have been of the utmost value to the police in\\ntracing her, was lost beyond recovery. Once again \"Mr. Brown\" had\\ntriumphed.\\nThe immediate result of this set back was to effect a\\nrapprochement between Julius Hersheimmer and the Young\\nAdventurers. All barriers went down with a crash, and Tommy and\\nTuppence felt they had known the young American all their lives.\\nThey abandoned the discreet reticence of \"private inquiry\\nagents,\" and revealed to him the whole history of the joint\\nventure, whereat the young man declared himself \"tickled to\\ndeath.\"\\nHe turned to Tuppence at the close of the narration.\\n\"I\\'ve always had a kind of idea that English girls were just a\\nmite moss-grown. Old-fashioned and sweet, you know, but scared to\\nmove round without a footman or a maiden aunt. I guess I\\'m a bit\\nbehind the times!\"\\nThe upshot of these confidential relations was that Tommy and\\nTuppence took up their abode forthwith at the Ritz, in order, as\\nTuppence put it, to keep in touch with Jane Finn\\'s only living\\nrelation. \"And put like that,\" she added confidentially to Tommy,\\n\"nobody could boggle at the expense!\"\\nNobody did, which was the great thing.\\n\"And now,\" said the young lady on the morning after their\\ninstallation, \"to work!\"\\nMr. Beresford put down the Daily Mail, which he was reading, and\\napplauded with somewhat unnecessary vigour. He was politely\\nrequested by his colleague not to be an ass.\\n\"Dash it all, Tommy, we\\'ve got to DO something for our money.\"\\nTommy sighed.\\n\"Yes, I fear even the dear old Government will not support us at\\nthe Ritz in idleness for ever.\"\\n\"Therefore, as I said before, we must DO something.\"\\n\"Well,\" said Tommy, picking up the Daily Mail again, \"DO it. I\\nshan\\'t stop you.\"\\n\"You see,\" continued Tuppence. \"I\\'ve been thinking----\"\\nShe was interrupted by a fresh bout of applause.\\n\"It\\'s all very well for you to sit there being funny, Tommy. It\\nwould do you no harm to do a little brain work too.\"\\n\"My union, Tuppence, my union! It does not permit me to work\\nbefore 11 a.m.\"\\n\"Tommy, do you want something thrown at you? It is absolutely\\nessential that we should without delay map out a plan of\\ncampaign.\"\\n\"Hear, hear!\"\\n\"Well, let\\'s do it.\"\\nTommy laid his paper finally aside. \"There\\'s something of the\\nsimplicity of the truly great mind about you, Tuppence. Fire\\nahead. I\\'m listening.\"\\n\"To begin with,\" said Tuppence, \"what have we to go upon?\"\\n\"Absolutely nothing,\" said Tommy cheerily.\\n\"Wrong!\" Tuppence wagged an energetic finger. \"We have two\\ndistinct clues.\"\\n\"What are they?\"\\n\"First clue, we know one of the gang.\"\\n\"Whittington?\"\\n\"Yes. I\\'d recognize him anywhere.\"\\n\"Hum,\" said Tommy doubtfully, \"I don\\'t call that much of a clue.\\nYou don\\'t know where to look for him, and it\\'s about a thousand\\nto one against your running against him by accident.\"\\n\"I\\'m not so sure about that,\" replied Tuppence thoughtfully.\\n\"I\\'ve often noticed that once coincidences start happening they\\ngo on happening in the most extraordinary way. I dare say it\\'s\\nsome natural law that we haven\\'t found out. Still, as you say, we\\ncan\\'t rely on that. But there ARE places in London where simply\\nevery one is bound to turn up sooner or later. Piccadilly Circus,\\nfor instance. One of my ideas was to take up my stand there\\nevery day with a tray of flags.\"\\n\"What about meals?\" inquired the practical Tommy.\\n\"How like a man! What does mere food matter?\"\\n\"That\\'s all very well. You\\'ve just had a thundering good\\nbreakfast. No one\\'s got a better appetite than you have,\\nTuppence, and by tea-time you\\'d be eating the flags, pins and\\nall. But, honestly, I don\\'t think much of the idea. Whittington\\nmayn\\'t be in London at all.\"\\n\"That\\'s true. Anyway, I think clue No. 2 is more promising.\"\\n\"Let\\'s hear it.\"\\n\"It\\'s nothing much. Only a Christian name--Rita. Whittington\\nmentioned it that day.\"\\n\"Are you proposing a third advertisement: Wanted, female crook,\\nanswering to the name of Rita?\"\\n\"I am not. I propose to reason in a logical manner. That man,\\nDanvers, was shadowed on the way over, wasn\\'t he? And it\\'s more\\nlikely to have been a woman than a man----\"\\n\"I don\\'t see that at all.\"\\n\"I am absolutely certain that it would be a woman, and a\\ngood-looking one,\" replied Tuppence calmly.\\n\"On these technical points I bow to your decision,\" murmured Mr.\\nBeresford.\\n\"Now, obviously this woman, whoever she was, was saved.\"\\n\"How do you make that out?\"\\n\"If she wasn\\'t, how would they have known Jane Finn had got the\\npapers?\"\\n\"Correct. Proceed, O Sherlock!\"\\n\"Now there\\'s just a chance, I admit it\\'s only a chance, that this\\nwoman may have been \\'Rita.\\' \"\\n\"And if so?\"\\n\"If so, we\\'ve got to hunt through the survivors of the Lusitania\\ntill we find her.\"\\n\"Then the first thing is to get a list of the survivors.\"\\n\"I\\'ve got it. I wrote a long list of things I wanted to know,\\nand sent it to Mr. Carter. I got his reply this morning, and\\namong other things it encloses the official statement of those\\nsaved from the Lusitania. How\\'s that for clever little\\nTuppence?\"\\n\"Full marks for industry, zero for modesty. But the great point\\nis, is there a \\'Rita\\' on the list?\"\\n\"That\\'s just what I don\\'t know,\" confessed Tuppence.\\n\"Don\\'t know?\"\\n\"Yes. Look here.\" Together they bent over the list. \"You see,\\nvery few Christian names are given. They\\'re nearly all Mrs. or\\nMiss.\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"That complicates matters,\" he murmured thoughtfully.\\nTuppence gave her characteristic \"terrier\" shake.\\n\"Well, we\\'ve just got to get down to it, that\\'s all. We\\'ll start\\nwith the London area. Just note down the addresses of any of the\\nfemales who live in London or roundabout, while I put on my hat.\"\\nFive minutes later the young couple emerged into Piccadilly, and\\na few seconds later a taxi was bearing them to The Laurels,\\nGlendower Road, N.7, the residence of Mrs. Edgar Keith, whose\\nname figured first in a list of seven reposing in Tommy\\'s\\npocket-book.\\nThe Laurels was a dilapidated house, standing back from the road\\nwith a few grimy bushes to support the fiction of a front garden.\\nTommy paid off the taxi, and accompanied Tuppence to the front\\ndoor bell. As she was about to ring it, he arrested her hand.\\n\"What are you going to say?\"\\n\"What am I going to say? Why, I shall say--Oh dear, I don\\'t\\nknow. It\\'s very awkward.\"\\n\"I thought as much,\" said Tommy with satisfaction. \"How like a\\nwoman! No foresight! Now just stand aside, and see how easily\\nthe mere male deals with the situation.\" He pressed the bell.\\nTuppence withdrew to a suitable spot.\\nA slatternly looking servant, with an extremely dirty face and a\\npair of eyes that did not match, answered the door.\\nTommy had produced a notebook and pencil.\\n\"Good morning,\" he said briskly and cheerfully. \"From the\\nHampstead Borough Council. The new Voting Register. Mrs. Edgar\\nKeith lives here, does she not?\"\\n\"Yaas,\" said the servant.\\n\"Christian name?\" asked Tommy, his pencil poised.\\n\"Missus\\'s? Eleanor Jane.\"\\n\"Eleanor,\" spelt Tommy. \"Any sons or daughters over twenty-one?\"\\n\"Naow.\"\\n\"Thank you.\" Tommy closed the notebook with a brisk snap. \"Good\\nmorning.\"\\nThe servant volunteered her first remark:\\n\"I thought perhaps as you\\'d come about the gas,\" she observed\\ncryptically, and shut the door.\\nTommy rejoined his accomplice.\\n\"You see, Tuppence,\" he observed. \"Child\\'s play to the masculine\\nmind.\"\\n\"I don\\'t mind admitting that for once you\\'ve scored handsomely. I\\nshould never have thought of that.\"\\n\"Good wheeze, wasn\\'t it? And we can repeat it ad lib.\"\\nLunch-time found the young couple attacking a steak and chips in\\nan obscure hostelry with avidity. They had collected a Gladys\\nMary and a Marjorie, been baffled by one change of address, and\\nhad been forced to listen to a long lecture on universal suffrage\\nfrom a vivacious American lady whose Christian name had proved to\\nbe Sadie.\\n\"Ah!\" said Tommy, imbibing a long draught of beer, \"I feel\\nbetter. Where\\'s the next draw?\"\\nThe notebook lay on the table between them. Tuppence picked it\\nup.\\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer,\" she read, \"20 South Audley Mansions. Miss\\nWheeler, 43 Clapington Road, Battersea. She\\'s a lady\\'s maid, as\\nfar as I remember, so probably won\\'t be there, and, anyway, she\\'s\\nnot likely.\"\\n\"Then the Mayfair lady is clearly indicated as the first port of\\ncall.\"\\n\"Tommy, I\\'m getting discouraged.\"\\n\"Buck up, old bean. We always knew it was an outside chance.\\nAnd, anyway, we\\'re only starting. If we draw a blank in London,\\nthere\\'s a fine tour of England, Ireland and Scotland before us.\"\\n\"True,\" said Tuppence, her flagging spirits reviving. \"And all\\nexpenses paid! But, oh, Tommy, I do like things to happen\\nquickly. So far, adventure has succeeded adventure, but this\\nmorning has been dull as dull.\"\\n\"You must stifle this longing for vulgar sensation, Tuppence.\\nRemember that if Mr. Brown is all he is reported to be, it\\'s a\\nwonder that he has not ere now done us to death. That\\'s a good\\nsentence, quite a literary flavour about it.\"\\n\"You\\'re really more conceited than I am--with less excuse! Ahem!\\nBut it certainly is queer that Mr. Brown has not yet wreaked\\nvengeance upon us. (You see, I can do it too.) We pass on our way\\nunscathed.\"\\n\"Perhaps he doesn\\'t think us worth bothering about,\" suggested\\nthe young man simply.\\nTuppence received the remark with great disfavour.\\n\"How horrid you are, Tommy. Just as though we didn\\'t count.\"\\n\"Sorry, Tuppence. What I meant was that we work like moles in\\nthe dark, and that he has no suspicion of our nefarious schemes.\\nHa ha!\"\\n\"Ha ha!\" echoed Tuppence approvingly, as she rose.\\nSouth Audley Mansions was an imposing-looking block of flats just\\noff Park Lane. No. 20 was on the second floor.\\nTommy had by this time the glibness born of practice. He rattled\\noff the formula to the elderly woman, looking more like a\\nhousekeeper than a servant, who opened the door to him.\\n\"Christian name?\"\\n\"Margaret.\"\\nTommy spelt it, but the other interrupted him.\\n\"No, G U E.\"\\n\"Oh, Marguerite; French way, I see.\" He paused, then plunged\\nboldly. \"We had her down as Rita Vandemeyer, but I suppose that\\'s\\nincorrect?\"\\n\"She\\'s mostly called that, sir, but Marguerite\\'s her name.\"\\n\"Thank you. That\\'s all. Good morning.\"\\nHardly able to contain his excitement, Tommy hurried down the\\nstairs. Tuppence was waiting at the angle of the turn.\\n\"You heard?\"\\n\"Yes. Oh, TOMMY!\"\\nTommy squeezed her arm sympathetically.\\n\"I know, old thing. I feel the same.\"\\n\"It\\'s--it\\'s so lovely to think of things--and then for them\\nreally to happen!\" cried Tuppence enthusiastically.\\nHer hand was still in Tommy\\'s. They had reached the entrance\\nhall. There were footsteps on the stairs above them, and voices.\\nSuddenly, to Tommy\\'s complete surprise, Tuppence dragged him into\\nthe little space by the side of the lift where the shadow was\\ndeepest.\\n\"What the----\"\\n\"Hush!\"\\nTwo men came down the stairs and passed out through the entrance.\\nTuppence\\'s hand closed tighter on Tommy\\'s arm.\\n\"Quick--follow them. I daren\\'t. He might recognize me. I don\\'t\\nknow who the other man is, but the bigger of the two was\\nWhittington.\"\\nCHAPTER VII\\nTHE HOUSE IN SOHO\\nWHITTINGTON and his companion were walking at a good pace. Tommy\\nstarted in pursuit at once, and was in time to see them turn the\\ncorner of the street. His vigorous strides soon enabled him to\\ngain upon them, and by the time he, in his turn, reached the\\ncorner the distance between them was sensibly lessened. The small\\nMayfair streets were comparatively deserted, and he judged it\\nwise to content himself with keeping them in sight.\\nThe sport was a new one to him. Though familiar with the\\ntechnicalities from a course of novel reading, he had never\\nbefore attempted to \"follow\" anyone, and it appeared to him at\\nonce that, in actual practice, the proceeding was fraught with\\ndifficulties. Supposing, for instance, that they should suddenly\\nhail a taxi? In books, you simply leapt into another, promised\\nthe driver a sovereign--or its modern equivalent--and there you\\nwere. In actual fact, Tommy foresaw that it was extremely likely\\nthere would be no second taxi. Therefore he would have to run.\\nWhat happened in actual fact to a young man who ran incessantly\\nand persistently through the London streets? In a main road he\\nmight hope to create the illusion that he was merely running for\\na bus. But in these obscure aristocratic byways he could not but\\nfeel that an officious policeman might stop him to explain\\nmatters.\\nAt this juncture in his thoughts a taxi with flag erect turned\\nthe corner of the street ahead. Tommy held his breath. Would\\nthey hail it?\\nHe drew a sigh of relief as they allowed it to pass unchallenged.\\nTheir course was a zigzag one designed to bring them as quickly\\nas possible to Oxford Street. When at length they turned into\\nit, proceeding in an easterly direction, Tommy slightly increased\\nhis pace. Little by little he gained upon them. On the crowded\\npavement there was little chance of his attracting their notice,\\nand he was anxious if possible to catch a word or two of their\\nconversation. In this he was completely foiled; they spoke low\\nand the din of the traffic drowned their voices effectually.\\nJust before the Bond Street Tube station they crossed the road,\\nTommy, unperceived, faithfully at their heels, and entered the\\nbig Lyons\\'. There they went up to the first floor, and sat at a\\nsmall table in the window. It was late, and the place was\\nthinning out. Tommy took a seat at the table next to them,\\nsitting directly behind Whittington in case of recognition. On\\nthe other hand, he had a full view of the second man and studied\\nhim attentively. He was fair, with a weak, unpleasant face, and\\nTommy put him down as being either a Russian or a Pole. He was\\nprobably about fifty years of age, his shoulders cringed a little\\nas he talked, and his eyes, small and crafty, shifted\\nunceasingly.\\nHaving already lunched heartily, Tommy contented himself with\\nordering a Welsh rarebit and a cup of coffee. Whittington\\nordered a substantial lunch for himself and his companion; then,\\nas the waitress withdrew, he moved his chair a little closer to\\nthe table and began to talk earnestly in a low voice. The other\\nman joined in. Listen as he would, Tommy could only catch a word\\nhere and there; but the gist of it seemed to be some directions\\nor orders which the big man was impressing on his companion, and\\nwith which the latter seemed from time to time to disagree.\\nWhittington addressed the other as Boris.\\nTommy caught the word \"Ireland\" several times, also \"propaganda,\"\\nbut of Jane Finn there was no mention. Suddenly, in a lull in\\nthe clatter of the room, he got one phrase entire. Whittington\\nwas speaking. \"Ah, but you don\\'t know Flossie. She\\'s a marvel.\\nAn archbishop would swear she was his own mother. She gets the\\nvoice right every time, and that\\'s really the principal thing.\"\\nTommy did not hear Boris\\'s reply, but in response to it\\nWhittington said something that sounded like: \"Of course--only\\nin an emergency....\"\\nThen he lost the thread again. But presently the phrases became\\ndistinct again whether because the other two had insensibly\\nraised their voices, or because Tommy\\'s ears were getting more\\nattuned, he could not tell. But two words certainly had a most\\nstimulating effect upon the listener. They were uttered by Boris\\nand they were: \"Mr. Brown.\"\\nWhittington seemed to remonstrate with him, but he merely\\nlaughed.\\n\"Why not, my friend? It is a name most respectable--most common.\\nDid he not choose it for that reason? Ah, I should like to meet\\nhim--Mr. Brown.\"\\nThere was a steely ring in Whittington\\'s voice as he replied:\\n\"Who knows? You may have met him already.\"\\n\"Bah!\" retorted the other. \"That is children\\'s talk--a fable for\\nthe police. Do you know what I say to myself sometimes? That he\\nis a fable invented by the Inner Ring, a bogy to frighten us\\nwith. It might be so.\"\\n\"And it might not.\"\\n\"I wonder ... or is it indeed true that he is with us and amongst\\nus, unknown to all but a chosen few? If so, he keeps his secret\\nwell. And the idea is a good one, yes. We never know. We look\\nat each other--ONE OF US IS MR. BROWN--which? He commands--but\\nalso he serves. Among us--in the midst of us. And no one knows\\nwhich he is....\"\\nWith an effort the Russian shook off the vagary of his fancy. He\\nlooked at his watch.\\n\"Yes,\" said Whittington. \"We might as well go.\"\\nHe called the waitress and asked for his bill. Tommy did\\nlikewise, and a few moments later was following the two men down\\nthe stairs.\\nOutside, Whittington hailed a taxi, and directed the driver to go\\nto Waterloo.\\nTaxis were plentiful here, and before Whittington\\'s had driven\\noff another was drawing up to the curb in obedience to Tommy\\'s\\nperemptory hand.\\n\"Follow that other taxi,\" directed the young man. \"Don\\'t lose\\nit.\"\\nThe elderly chauffeur showed no interest. He merely grunted and\\njerked down his flag. The drive was uneventful. Tommy\\'s taxi\\ncame to rest at the departure platform just after Whittington\\'s.\\nTommy was behind him at the booking-office. He took a first-class\\nsingle ticket to Bournemouth, Tommy did the same. As he emerged,\\nBoris remarked, glancing up at the clock: \"You are early. You\\nhave nearly half an hour.\"\\nBoris\\'s words had aroused a new train of thought in Tommy\\'s mind.\\nClearly Whittington was making the journey alone, while the other\\nremained in London. Therefore he was left with a choice as to\\nwhich he would follow. Obviously, he could not follow both of\\nthem unless----Like Boris, he glanced up at the clock, and then\\nto the announcement board of the trains. The Bournemouth train\\nleft at 3.30. It was now ten past. Whittington and Boris were\\nwalking up and down by the bookstall. He gave one doubtful look\\nat them, then hurried into an adjacent telephone box. He dared\\nnot waste time in trying to get hold of Tuppence. In all\\nprobability she was still in the neighbourhood of South Audley\\nMansions. But there remained another ally. He rang up the Ritz\\nand asked for Julius Hersheimmer. There was a click and a buzz.\\nOh, if only the young American was in his room! There was another\\nclick, and then \"Hello\" in unmistakable accents came over the\\nwire.\\n\"That you, Hersheimmer? Beresford speaking. I\\'m at Waterloo.\\nI\\'ve followed Whittington and another man here. No time to\\nexplain. Whittington\\'s off to Bournemouth by the 3.30. Can you\\nget there by then?\"\\nThe reply was reassuring.\\n\"Sure. I\\'ll hustle.\"\\nThe telephone rang off. Tommy put back the receiver with a sigh\\nof relief. His opinion of Julius\\'s power of hustling was high.\\nHe felt instinctively that the American would arrive in time.\\nWhittington and Boris were still where he had left them. If Boris\\nremained to see his friend off, all was well. Then Tommy fingered\\nhis pocket thoughtfully. In spite of the carte blanche assured\\nto him, he had not yet acquired the habit of going about with any\\nconsiderable sum of money on him. The taking of the first-class\\nticket to Bournemouth had left him with only a few shillings in\\nhis pocket. It was to be hoped that Julius would arrive better\\nprovided.\\nIn the meantime, the minutes were creeping by: 3.15, 3.20, 3.25,\\n3.27. Supposing Julius did not get there in time. 3.29.... Doors\\nwere banging. Tommy felt cold waves of despair pass over him.\\nThen a hand fell on his shoulder.\\n\"Here I am, son. Your British traffic beats description! Put me\\nwise to the crooks right away.\"\\n\"That\\'s Whittington--there, getting in now, that big dark man.\\nThe other is the foreign chap he\\'s talking to.\"\\n\"I\\'m on to them. Which of the two is my bird?\"\\nTommy had thought out this question.\\n\"Got any money with you?\"\\nJulius shook his head, and Tommy\\'s face fell.\\n\"I guess I haven\\'t more than three or four hundred dollars with\\nme at the moment,\" explained the American.\\nTommy gave a faint whoop of relief.\\n\"Oh, Lord, you millionaires! You don\\'t talk the same language!\\nClimb aboard the lugger. Here\\'s your ticket. Whittington\\'s your\\nman.\"\\n\"Me for Whittington!\" said Julius darkly. The train was just\\nstarting as he swung himself aboard. \"So long, Tommy.\" The\\ntrain slid out of the station.\\nTommy drew a deep breath. The man Boris was coming along the\\nplatform towards him. Tommy allowed him to pass and then took up\\nthe chase once more.\\nFrom Waterloo Boris took the tube as far as Piccadilly Circus.\\nThen he walked up Shaftesbury Avenue, finally turning off into\\nthe maze of mean streets round Soho. Tommy followed him at a\\njudicious distance.\\nThey reached at length a small dilapidated square. The houses\\nthere had a sinister air in the midst of their dirt and decay.\\nBoris looked round, and Tommy drew back into the shelter of a\\nfriendly porch. The place was almost deserted. It was a\\ncul-de-sac, and consequently no traffic passed that way. The\\nstealthy way the other had looked round stimulated Tommy\\'s\\nimagination. From the shelter of the doorway he watched him go\\nup the steps of a particularly evil-looking house and rap\\nsharply, with a peculiar rhythm, on the door. It was opened\\npromptly, he said a word or two to the doorkeeper, then passed\\ninside. The door was shut to again.\\nIt was at this juncture that Tommy lost his head. What he ought\\nto have done, what any sane man would have done, was to remain\\npatiently where he was and wait for his man to come out again.\\nWhat he did do was entirely foreign to the sober common sense\\nwhich was, as a rule, his leading characteristic. Something, as\\nhe expressed it, seemed to snap in his brain. Without a moment\\'s\\npause for reflection he, too, went up the steps, and reproduced\\nas far as he was able the peculiar knock.\\nThe door swung open with the same promptness as before. A\\nvillainous-faced man with close-cropped hair stood in the\\ndoorway.\\n\"Well?\" he grunted.\\nIt was at that moment that the full realization of his folly\\nbegan to come home to Tommy. But he dared not hesitate. He\\nseized at the first words that came into his mind.\\n\"Mr. Brown?\" he said.\\nTo his surprise the man stood aside.\\n\"Upstairs,\" he said, jerking his thumb over his shoulder, \"second\\ndoor on your left.\"\\nCHAPTER VIII\\nTHE ADVENTURES OF TOMMY\\nTAKEN aback though he was by the man\\'s words, Tommy did not\\nhesitate. If audacity had successfully carried him so far, it was\\nto be hoped it would carry him yet farther. He quietly passed\\ninto the house and mounted the ramshackle staircase. Everything\\nin the house was filthy beyond words. The grimy paper, of a\\npattern now indistinguishable, hung in loose festoons from the\\nwall. In every angle was a grey mass of cobweb.\\nTommy proceeded leisurely. By the time he reached the bend of\\nthe staircase, he had heard the man below disappear into a back\\nroom. Clearly no suspicion attached to him as yet. To come to\\nthe house and ask for \"Mr. Brown\" appeared indeed to be a\\nreasonable and natural proceeding.\\nAt the top of the stairs Tommy halted to consider his next move.\\nIn front of him ran a narrow passage, with doors opening on\\neither side of it. From the one nearest him on the left came a\\nlow murmur of voices. It was this room which he had been\\ndirected to enter. But what held his glance fascinated was a\\nsmall recess immediately on his right, half concealed by a torn\\nvelvet curtain. It was directly opposite the left-handed door\\nand, owing to its angle, it also commanded a good view of the\\nupper part of the staircase. As a hiding-place for one or, at a\\npinch, two men, it was ideal, being about two feet deep and three\\nfeet wide. It attracted Tommy mightily. He thought things over\\nin his usual slow and steady way, deciding that the mention of\\n\"Mr. Brown\" was not a request for an individual, but in all\\nprobability a password used by the gang. His lucky use of it had\\ngained him admission. So far he had aroused no suspicion. But he\\nmust decide quickly on his next step.\\nSuppose he were boldly to enter the room on the left of the\\npassage. Would the mere fact of his having been admitted to the\\nhouse be sufficient? Perhaps a further password would be\\nrequired, or, at any rate, some proof of identity. The\\ndoorkeeper clearly did not know all the members of the gang by\\nsight, but it might be different upstairs. On the whole it seemed\\nto him that luck had served him very well so far, but that there\\nwas such a thing as trusting it too far. To enter that room was a\\ncolossal risk. He could not hope to sustain his part\\nindefinitely; sooner or later he was almost bound to betray\\nhimself, and then he would have thrown away a vital chance in\\nmere foolhardiness.\\nA repetition of the signal knock sounded on the door below, and\\nTommy, his mind made up, slipped quickly into the recess, and\\ncautiously drew the curtain farther across so that it shielded\\nhim completely from sight. There were several rents and slits in\\nthe ancient material which afforded him a good view. He would\\nwatch events, and any time he chose could, after all, join the\\nassembly, modelling his behaviour on that of the new arrival.\\nThe man who came up the staircase with a furtive, soft-footed\\ntread was quite unknown to Tommy. He was obviously of the very\\ndregs of society. The low beetling brows, and the criminal jaw,\\nthe bestiality of the whole countenance were new to the young\\nman, though he was a type that Scotland Yard would have\\nrecognized at a glance.\\nThe man passed the recess, breathing heavily as he went. He\\nstopped at the door opposite, and gave a repetition of the signal\\nknock. A voice inside called out something, and the man opened\\nthe door and passed in, affording Tommy a momentary glimpse of\\nthe room inside. He thought there must be about four or five\\npeople seated round a long table that took up most of the space,\\nbut his attention was caught and held by a tall man with\\nclose-cropped hair and a short, pointed, naval-looking beard, who\\nsat at the head of the table with papers in front of him. As the\\nnew-comer entered he glanced up, and with a correct, but\\ncuriously precise enunciation, which attracted Tommy\\'s notice, he\\nasked:\\n\"Your number, comrade?\"\\n\"Fourteen, gov\\'nor,\" replied the other hoarsely.\\n\"Correct.\"\\nThe door shut again.\\n\"If that isn\\'t a Hun, I\\'m a Dutchman!\" said Tommy to himself.\\n\"And running the show darned systematically too--as they always\\ndo. Lucky I didn\\'t roll in. I\\'d have given the wrong number, and\\nthere would have been the deuce to pay. No, this is the place\\nfor me. Hullo, here\\'s another knock.\"\\nThis visitor proved to be of an entirely different type to the\\nlast. Tommy recognized in him an Irish Sinn Feiner. Certainly\\nMr. Brown\\'s organization was a far-reaching concern. The common\\ncriminal, the well-bred Irish gentleman, the pale Russian, and\\nthe efficient German master of the ceremonies! Truly a strange\\nand sinister gathering! Who was this man who held in his finger\\nthese curiously variegated links of an unknown chain?\\nIn this case, the procedure was exactly the same. The signal\\nknock, the demand for a number, and the reply \"Correct.\"\\nTwo knocks followed in quick succession on the door below. The\\nfirst man was quite unknown to Tommy, who put him down as a city\\nclerk. A quiet, intelligent-looking man, rather shabbily dressed.\\nThe second was of the working classes, and his face was vaguely\\nfamiliar to the young man.\\nThree minutes later came another, a man of commanding appearance,\\nexquisitely dressed, and evidently well born. His face, again,\\nwas not unknown to the watcher, though he could not for the\\nmoment put a name to it.\\nAfter his arrival there was a long wait. In fact Tommy concluded\\nthat the gathering was now complete, and was just cautiously\\ncreeping out from his hiding-place, when another knock sent him\\nscuttling back to cover.\\nThis last-comer came up the stairs so quietly that he was almost\\nabreast of Tommy before the young man had realized his presence.\\nHe was a small man, very pale, with a gentle almost womanish air.\\nThe angle of the cheek-bones hinted at his Slavonic ancestry,\\notherwise there was nothing to indicate his nationality. As he\\npassed the recess, he turned his head slowly. The strange light\\neyes seemed to burn through the curtain; Tommy could hardly\\nbelieve that the man did not know he was there and in spite of\\nhimself he shivered. He was no more fanciful than the majority of\\nyoung Englishmen, but he could not rid himself of the impression\\nthat some unusually potent force emanated from the man. The\\ncreature reminded him of a venomous snake.\\nA moment later his impression was proved correct. The new-comer\\nknocked on the door as all had done, but his reception was very\\ndifferent. The bearded man rose to his feet, and all the others\\nfollowed suit. The German came forward and shook hands. His\\nheels clicked together.\\n\"We are honoured,\" he said. \"We are greatly honoured. I much\\nfeared that it would be impossible.\"\\nThe other answered in a low voice that had a kind of hiss in it:\\n\"There were difficulties. It will not be possible again, I fear.\\nBut one meeting is essential--to define my policy. I can do\\nnothing without--Mr. Brown. He is here?\"\\nThe change in the German\\'s voice was audible as he replied with\\nslight hesitation:\\n\"We have received a message. It is impossible for him to be\\npresent in person.\" He stopped, giving a curious impression of\\nhaving left the sentence unfinished.\\nA very slow smile overspread the face of the other. He looked\\nround at a circle of uneasy faces.\\n\"Ah! I understand. I have read of his methods. He works in the\\ndark and trusts no one. But, all the same, it is possible that\\nhe is among us now....\" He looked round him again, and again that\\nexpression of fear swept over the group. Each man seemed eyeing\\nhis neighbour doubtfully.\\nThe Russian tapped his cheek.\\n\"So be it. Let us proceed.\"\\nThe German seemed to pull himself together. He indicated the\\nplace he had been occupying at the head of the table. The Russian\\ndemurred, but the other insisted.\\n\"It is the only possible place,\" he said, \"for--Number One.\\nPerhaps Number Fourteen will shut the door?\"\\nIn another moment Tommy was once more confronting bare wooden\\npanels, and the voices within had sunk once more to a mere\\nundistinguishable murmur. Tommy became restive. The conversation\\nhe had overheard had stimulated his curiosity. He felt that, by\\nhook or by crook, he must hear more.\\nThere was no sound from below, and it did not seem likely that\\nthe doorkeeper would come upstairs. After listening intently for\\na minute or two, he put his head round the curtain. The passage\\nwas deserted. Tommy bent down and removed his shoes, then,\\nleaving them behind the curtain, he walked gingerly out on his\\nstockinged feet, and kneeling down by the closed door he laid his\\near cautiously to the crack. To his intense annoyance he could\\ndistinguish little more; just a chance word here and there if a\\nvoice was raised, which merely served to whet his curiosity still\\nfarther.\\nHe eyed the handle of the door tentatively. Could he turn it by\\ndegrees so gently and imperceptibly that those in the room would\\nnotice nothing? He decided that with great care it could be\\ndone. Very slowly, a fraction of an inch at a time, he moved it\\nround, holding his breath in his excessive care. A little more--a\\nlittle more still--would it never be finished? Ah! at last it\\nwould turn no farther.\\nHe stayed so for a minute or two, then drew a deep breath, and\\npressed it ever so slightly inward. The door did not budge.\\nTommy was annoyed. If he had to use too much force, it would\\nalmost certainly creak. He waited until the voices rose a little,\\nthen he tried again. Still nothing happened. He increased the\\npressure. Had the beastly thing stuck? Finally, in desperation,\\nhe pushed with all his might. But the door remained firm, and at\\nlast the truth dawned upon him. It was locked or bolted on the\\ninside.\\nFor a moment or two Tommy\\'s indignation got the better of him.\\n\"Well, I\\'m damned!\" he said. \"What a dirty trick!\"\\nAs his indignation cooled, he prepared to face the situation.\\nClearly the first thing to be done was to restore the handle to\\nits original position. If he let it go suddenly, the men inside\\nwould be almost certain to notice it, so, with the same infinite\\npains, he reversed his former tactics. All went well, and with a\\nsigh of relief the young man rose to his feet. There was a\\ncertain bulldog tenacity about Tommy that made him slow to admit\\ndefeat. Checkmated for the moment, he was far from abandoning the\\nconflict. He still intended to hear what was going on in the\\nlocked room. As one plan had failed, he must hunt about for\\nanother.\\nHe looked round him. A little farther along the passage on the\\nleft was a second door. He slipped silently along to it. He\\nlistened for a moment or two, then tried the handle. It yielded,\\nand he slipped inside.\\nThe room, which was untenanted, was furnished as a bedroom. Like\\neverything else in the house, the furniture was falling to\\npieces, and the dirt was, if anything, more abundant.\\nBut what interested Tommy was the thing he had hoped to find, a\\ncommunicating door between the two rooms, up on the left by the\\nwindow. Carefully closing the door into the passage behind him,\\nhe stepped across to the other and examined it closely. The bolt\\nwas shot across it. It was very rusty, and had clearly not been\\nused for some time. By gently wriggling it to and fro, Tommy\\nmanaged to draw it back without making too much noise. Then he\\nrepeated his former manoeuvres with the handle--this time with\\ncomplete success. The door swung open--a crack, a mere fraction,\\nbut enough for Tommy to hear what went on. There was a velvet\\nportiere on the inside of this door which prevented him from\\nseeing, but he was able to recognize the voices with a reasonable\\namount of accuracy.\\nThe Sinn Feiner was speaking. His rich Irish voice was\\nunmistakable:\\n\"That\\'s all very well. But more money is essential. No money--no\\nresults!\"\\nAnother voice which Tommy rather thought was that of Boris\\nreplied:\\n\"Will you guarantee that there ARE results?\"\\n\"In a month from now--sooner or later as you wish--I will\\nguarantee you such a reign of terror in Ireland as shall shake\\nthe British Empire to its foundations.\"\\nThere was a pause, and then came the soft, sibilant accents of\\nNumber One:\\n\"Good! You shall have the money. Boris, you will see to that.\"\\nBoris asked a question:\\n\"Via the Irish Americans, and Mr. Potter as usual?\"\\n\"I guess that\\'ll be all right!\" said a new voice, with a\\ntransatlantic intonation, \"though I\\'d like to point out, here and\\nnow, that things are getting a mite difficult. There\\'s not the\\nsympathy there was, and a growing disposition to let the Irish\\nsettle their own affairs without interference from America.\"\\nTommy felt that Boris had shrugged his shoulders as he answered:\\n\"Does that matter, since the money only nominally comes from the\\nStates?\"\\n\"The chief difficulty is the landing of the ammunition,\" said the\\nSinn Feiner. \"The money is conveyed in easily enough--thanks to\\nour colleague here.\"\\nAnother voice, which Tommy fancied was that of the tall,\\ncommanding-looking man whose face had seemed familiar to him,\\nsaid:\\n\"Think of the feelings of Belfast if they could hear you!\"\\n\"That is settled, then,\" said the sibilant tones. \"Now, in the\\nmatter of the loan to an English newspaper, you have arranged the\\ndetails satisfactorily, Boris?\"\\n\"I think so.\"\\n\"That is good. An official denial from Moscow will be\\nforthcoming if necessary.\"\\nThere was a pause, and then the clear voice of the German broke\\nthe silence:\\n\"I am directed by--Mr. Brown, to place the summaries of the\\nreports from the different unions before you. That of the miners\\nis most satisfactory. We must hold back the railways. There may\\nbe trouble with the A.S.E.\"\\nFor a long time there was a silence, broken only by the rustle of\\npapers and an occasional word of explanation from the German.\\nThen Tommy heard the light tap-tap of fingers, drumming on the\\ntable.\\n\"And--the date, my friend?\" said Number One.\\n\"The 29th.\"\\nThe Russian seemed to consider:\\n\"That is rather soon.\"\\n\"I know. But it was settled by the principal Labour leaders, and\\nwe cannot seem to interfere too much. They must believe it to be\\nentirely their own show.\"\\nThe Russian laughed softly, as though amused.\\n\"Yes, yes,\" he said. \"That is true. They must have no inkling\\nthat we are using them for our own ends. They are honest\\nmen--and that is their value to us. It is curious--but you\\ncannot make a revolution without honest men. The instinct of the\\npopulace is infallible.\" He paused, and then repeated, as though\\nthe phrase pleased him: \"Every revolution has had its honest\\nmen. They are soon disposed of afterwards.\"\\nThere was a sinister note in his voice.\\nThe German resumed:\\n\"Clymes must go. He is too far-seeing. Number Fourteen will see\\nto that.\"\\nThere was a hoarse murmur.\\n\"That\\'s all right, gov\\'nor.\" And then after a moment or two:\\n\"Suppose I\\'m nabbed.\"\\n\"You will have the best legal talent to defend you,\" replied the\\nGerman quietly. \"But in any case you will wear gloves fitted\\nwith the finger-prints of a notorious housebreaker. You have\\nlittle to fear.\"\\n\"Oh, I ain\\'t afraid, gov\\'nor. All for the good of the cause. The\\nstreets is going to run with blood, so they say.\" He spoke with a\\ngrim relish. \"Dreams of it, sometimes, I does. And diamonds and\\npearls rolling about in the gutter for anyone to pick up!\"\\nTommy heard a chair shifted. Then Number One spoke:\\n\"Then all is arranged. We are assured of success?\"\\n\"I--think so.\" But the German spoke with less than his usual\\nconfidence.\\nNumber One\\'s voice held suddenly a dangerous quality:\\n\"What has gone wrong?\"\\n\"Nothing; but----\"\\n\"But what?\"\\n\"The Labour leaders. Without them, as you say, we can do\\nnothing. If they do not declare a general strike on the 29th----\"\\n\"Why should they not?\"\\n\"As you\\'ve said, they\\'re honest. And, in spite of everything\\nwe\\'ve done to discredit the Government in their eyes, I\\'m not\\nsure that they haven\\'t got a sneaking faith and belief in it.\"\\n\"But----\"\\n\"I know. They abuse it unceasingly. But, on the whole, public\\nopinion swings to the side of the Government. They will not go\\nagainst it.\"\\nAgain the Russian\\'s fingers drummed on the table.\\n\"To the point, my friend. I was given to understand that there\\nwas a certain document in existence which assured success.\"\\n\"That is so. If that document were placed before the leaders,\\nthe result would be immediate. They would publish it broadcast\\nthroughout England, and declare for the revolution without a\\nmoment\\'s hesitation. The Government would be broken finally and\\ncompletely.\"\\n\"Then what more do you want?\"\\n\"The document itself,\" said the German bluntly.\\n\"Ah! It is not in your possession? But you know where it is?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"Does anyone know where it is?\"\\n\"One person--perhaps. And we are not sure of that even.\"\\n\"Who is this person?\"\\n\"A girl.\"\\nTommy held his breath.\\n\"A girl?\" The Russian\\'s voice rose contemptuously. \"And you have\\nnot made her speak? In Russia we have ways of making a girl\\ntalk.\"\\n\"This case is different,\" said the German sullenly.\\n\"How--different?\" He paused a moment, then went on: \"Where is\\nthe girl now?\"\\n\"The girl?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"She is----\"\\nBut Tommy heard no more. A crashing blow descended on his head,\\nand all was darkness.\\nCHAPTER IX\\nTUPPENCE ENTERS DOMESTIC SERVICE\\nWHEN Tommy set forth on the trail of the two men, it took all\\nTuppence\\'s self-command to refrain from accompanying him.\\nHowever, she contained herself as best she might, consoled by the\\nreflection that her reasoning had been justified by events. The\\ntwo men had undoubtedly come from the second floor flat, and that\\none slender thread of the name \"Rita\" had set the Young\\nAdventurers once more upon the track of the abductors of Jane\\nFinn.\\nThe question was what to do next? Tuppence hated letting the\\ngrass grow under her feet. Tommy was amply employed, and\\ndebarred from joining him in the chase, the girl felt at a loose\\nend. She retraced her steps to the entrance hall of the mansions.\\nIt was now tenanted by a small lift-boy, who was polishing brass\\nfittings, and whistling the latest air with a good deal of vigour\\nand a reasonable amount of accuracy.\\nHe glanced round at Tuppence\\'s entry. There was a certain amount\\nof the gamin element in the girl, at all events she invariably\\ngot on well with small boys. A sympathetic bond seemed instantly\\nto be formed. She reflected that an ally in the enemy\\'s camp, so\\nto speak, was not to be despised.\\n\"Well, William,\" she remarked cheerfully, in the best approved\\nhospital-early-morning style, \"getting a good shine up?\"\\nThe boy grinned responsively.\\n\"Albert, miss,\" he corrected.\\n\"Albert be it,\" said Tuppence. She glanced mysteriously round\\nthe hall. The effect was purposely a broad one in case Albert\\nshould miss it. She leaned towards the boy and dropped her voice:\\n\"I want a word with you, Albert.\"\\nAlbert ceased operations on the fittings and opened his mouth\\nslightly.\\n\"Look! Do you know what this is?\" With a dramatic gesture she\\nflung back the left side of her coat and exposed a small\\nenamelled badge. It was extremely unlikely that Albert would have\\nany knowledge of it--indeed, it would have been fatal for\\nTuppence\\'s plans, since the badge in question was the device of a\\nlocal training corps originated by the archdeacon in the early\\ndays of the war. Its presence in Tuppence\\'s coat was due to the\\nfact that she had used it for pinning in some flowers a day or\\ntwo before. But Tuppence had sharp eyes, and had noted the corner\\nof a threepenny detective novel protruding from Albert\\'s pocket,\\nand the immediate enlargement of his eyes told her that her\\ntactics were good, and that the fish would rise to the bait.\\n\"American Detective Force!\" she hissed.\\nAlbert fell for it.\\n\"Lord!\" he murmured ecstatically.\\nTuppence nodded at him with the air of one who has established a\\nthorough understanding.\\n\"Know who I\\'m after?\" she inquired genially.\\nAlbert, still round-eyed, demanded breathlessly:\\n\"One of the flats?\"\\nTuppence nodded and jerked a thumb up the stairs.\\n\"No. 20. Calls herself Vandemeyer. Vandemeyer! Ha! ha!\"\\nAlbert\\'s hand stole to his pocket.\\n\"A crook?\" he queried eagerly.\\n\"A crook? I should say so. Ready Rita they call her in the\\nStates.\"\\n\"Ready Rita,\" repeated Albert deliriously. \"Oh, ain\\'t it just\\nlike the pictures!\"\\nIt was. Tuppence was a great frequenter of the kinema.\\n\"Annie always said as how she was a bad lot,\" continued the boy.\\n\"Who\\'s Annie?\" inquired Tuppence idly.\\n\" \\'Ouse-parlourmaid. She\\'s leaving to-day. Many\\'s the time\\nAnnie\\'s said to me: \\'Mark my words, Albert, I wouldn\\'t wonder if\\nthe police was to come after her one of these days.\\' dust like\\nthat. But she\\'s a stunner to look at, ain\\'t she?\"\\n\"She\\'s some peach,\" allowed Tuppence carelessly. \"Finds it\\nuseful in her lay-out, you bet. Has she been wearing any of the\\nemeralds, by the way?\"\\n\"Emeralds? Them\\'s the green stones, isn\\'t they?\"\\nTuppence nodded.\\n\"That\\'s what we\\'re after her for. You know old man Rysdale?\"\\nAlbert shook his head.\\n\"Peter B. Rysdale, the oil king?\"\\n\"It seems sort of familiar to me.\"\\n\"The sparklers belonged to him. Finest collection of emeralds in\\nthe world. Worth a million dollars!\"\\n\"Lumme!\" came ecstatically from Albert. \"It sounds more like the\\npictures every minute.\"\\nTuppence smiled, gratified at the success of her efforts.\\n\"We haven\\'t exactly proved it yet. But we\\'re after her.\\nAnd\"--she produced a long-drawn-out wink--\"I guess she won\\'t get\\naway with the goods this time.\"\\nAlbert uttered another ejaculation indicative of delight.\\n\"Mind you, sonny, not a word of this,\" said Tuppence suddenly. \"I\\nguess I oughtn\\'t to have put you wise, but in the States we know\\na real smart lad when we see one.\"\\n\"I\\'ll not breathe a word,\" protested Albert eagerly. \"Ain\\'t there\\nanything I could do? A bit of shadowing, maybe, or such like?\"\\nTuppence affected to consider, then shook her head.\\n\"Not at the moment, but I\\'ll bear you in mind, son. What\\'s this\\nabout the girl you say is leaving?\"\\n\"Annie? Regular turn up, they \\'ad. As Annie said, servants is\\nsome one nowadays, and to be treated accordingly, and, what with\\nher passing the word round, she won\\'t find it so easy to get\\nanother.\"\\n\"Won\\'t she?\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. \"I wonder----\"\\nAn idea was dawning in her brain. She thought a minute or two,\\nthen tapped Albert on the shoulder.\\n\"See here, son, my brain\\'s got busy. How would it be if you\\nmentioned that you\\'d got a young cousin, or a friend of yours\\nhad, that might suit the place. You get me?\"\\n\"I\\'m there,\" said Albert instantly. \"You leave it to me, miss,\\nand I\\'ll fix the whole thing up in two ticks.\"\\n\"Some lad!\" commented Tuppence, with a nod of approval. \"You\\nmight say that the young woman could come in right away. You let\\nme know, and if it\\'s O.K. I\\'ll be round to-morrow at eleven\\no\\'clock.\"\\n\"Where am I to let you know to?\"\\n\"Ritz,\" replied Tuppence laconically. \"Name of Cowley.\"\\nAlbert eyed her enviously.\\n\"It must be a good job, this tec business.\"\\n\"It sure is,\" drawled Tuppence, \"especially when old man Rysdale\\nbacks the bill. But don\\'t fret, son. If this goes well, you\\nshall come in on the ground floor.\"\\nWith which promise she took leave of her new ally, and walked\\nbriskly away from South Audley Mansions, well pleased with her\\nmorning\\'s work.\\nBut there was no time to be lost. She went straight back to the\\nRitz and wrote a few brief words to Mr. Carter. Having\\ndispatched this, and Tommy not having yet returned--which did not\\nsurprise her--she started off on a shopping expedition which,\\nwith an interval for tea and assorted creamy cakes, occupied her\\nuntil well after six o\\'clock, and she returned to the hotel\\njaded, but satisfied with her purchases. Starting with a cheap\\nclothing store, and passing through one or two second-hand\\nestablishments, she had finished the day at a well-known\\nhairdresser\\'s. Now, in the seclusion of her bedroom, she\\nunwrapped that final purchase. Five minutes later she smiled\\ncontentedly at her reflection in the glass. With an actress\\'s\\npencil she had slightly altered the line of her eyebrows, and\\nthat, taken in conjunction with the new luxuriant growth of fair\\nhair above, so changed her appearance that she felt confident\\nthat even if she came face to face with Whittington he would not\\nrecognize her. She would wear elevators in her shoes, and the\\ncap and apron would be an even more valuable disguise. From\\nhospital experience she knew only too well that a nurse out of\\nuniform is frequently unrecognized by her patients.\\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence aloud, nodding at the pert reflection in the\\nglass, \"you\\'ll do.\" She then resumed her normal appearance.\\nDinner was a solitary meal. Tuppence was rather surprised at\\nTommy\\'s non-return. Julius, too, was absent--but that to the\\ngirl\\'s mind was more easily explained. His \"hustling\" activities\\nwere not confined to London, and his abrupt appearances and\\ndisappearances were fully accepted by the Young Adventurers as\\npart of the day\\'s work. It was quite on the cards that Julius P.\\nHersheimmer had left for Constantinople at a moment\\'s notice if\\nhe fancied that a clue to his cousin\\'s disappearance was to be\\nfound there. The energetic young man had succeeded in making the\\nlives of several Scotland Yard men unbearable to them, and the\\ntelephone girls at the Admiralty had learned to know and dread\\nthe familiar \"Hullo!\" He had spent three hours in Paris hustling\\nthe Prefecture, and had returned from there imbued with the idea,\\npossibly inspired by a weary French official, that the true clue\\nto the mystery was to be found in Ireland.\\n\"I dare say he\\'s dashed off there now,\" thought Tuppence. \"All\\nvery well, but this is very dull for ME! Here I am bursting with\\nnews, and absolutely no one to tell it to! Tommy might have\\nwired, or something. I wonder where he is. Anyway, he can\\'t have\\n\\'lost the trail\\' as they say. That reminds me----\" And Miss\\nCowley broke off in her meditations, and summoned a small boy.\\nTen minutes later the lady was ensconced comfortably on her bed,\\nsmoking cigarettes and deep in the perusal of Garnaby Williams,\\nthe Boy Detective, which, with other threepenny works of lurid\\nfiction, she had sent out to purchase. She felt, and rightly,\\nthat before the strain of attempting further intercourse with\\nAlbert, it would be as well to fortify herself with a good supply\\nof local colour.\\nThe morning brought a note from Mr. Carter:\\n\"DEAR MISS TUPPENCE,\\n\"You have made a splendid start, and I congratulate you. I feel,\\nthough, that I should like to point out to you once more the\\nrisks you are running, especially if you pursue the course you\\nindicate. Those people are absolutely desperate and incapable of\\neither mercy or pity. I feel that you probably underestimate the\\ndanger, and therefore warn you again that I can promise you no\\nprotection. You have given us valuable information, and if you\\nchoose to withdraw now no one could blame you. At any rate,\\nthink the matter over well before you decide.\\n\"If, in spite of my warnings, you make up your mind to go through\\nwith it, you will find everything arranged. You have lived for\\ntwo years with Miss Dufferin, The Parsonage, Llanelly, and Mrs.\\nVandemeyer can apply to her for a reference.\\n\"May I be permitted a word or two of advice? Stick as near to\\nthe truth as possible--it minimizes the danger of \\'slips.\\' I\\nsuggest that you should represent yourself to be what you are, a\\nformer V.A.D., who has chosen domestic service as a profession.\\nThere are many such at the present time. That explains away any\\nincongruities of voice or manner which otherwise might awaken\\nsuspicion.\\n\"Whichever way you decide, good luck to you.\\n\"Your sincere friend, \"MR. CARTER.\"\\nTuppence\\'s spirits rose mercurially. Mr. Carter\\'s warnings\\npassed unheeded. The young lady had far too much confidence in\\nherself to pay any heed to them.\\nWith some reluctance she abandoned the interesting part she had\\nsketched out for herself. Although she had no doubts of her own\\npowers to sustain a role indefinitely, she had too much common\\nsense not to recognize the force of Mr. Carter\\'s arguments.\\nThere was still no word or message from Tommy, but the morning\\npost brought a somewhat dirty postcard with the words: \"It\\'s\\nO.K.\" scrawled upon it.\\nAt ten-thirty Tuppence surveyed with pride a slightly battered\\ntin trunk containing her new possessions. It was artistically\\ncorded. It was with a slight blush that she rang the bell and\\nordered it to be placed in a taxi. She drove to Paddington, and\\nleft the box in the cloak room. She then repaired with a handbag\\nto the fastnesses of the ladies\\' waiting-room. Ten minutes later\\na metamorphosed Tuppence walked demurely out of the station and\\nentered a bus.\\nIt was a few minutes past eleven when Tuppence again entered the\\nhall of South Audley Mansions. Albert was on the look-out,\\nattending to his duties in a somewhat desultory fashion. He did\\nnot immediately recognize Tuppence. When he did, his admiration\\nwas unbounded.\\n\"Blest if I\\'d have known you! That rig-out\\'s top-hole.\"\\n\"Glad you like it, Albert,\" replied Tuppence modestly. \"By the\\nway, am I your cousin, or am I not?\"\\n\"Your voice too,\" cried the delighted boy. \"It\\'s as English as\\nanything! No, I said as a friend of mine knew a young gal. Annie\\nwasn\\'t best pleased. She\\'s stopped on till to-day--to oblige, SHE\\nsaid, but really it\\'s so as to put you against the place.\"\\n\"Nice girl,\" said Tuppence.\\nAlbert suspected no irony.\\n\"She\\'s style about her, and keeps her silver a treat--but, my\\nword, ain\\'t she got a temper. Are you going up now, miss? Step\\ninside the lift. No. 20 did you say?\" And he winked.\\nTuppence quelled him with a stern glance, and stepped inside.\\nAs she rang the bell of No. 20 she was conscious of Albert\\'s eyes\\nslowly descending beneath the level of the floor.\\nA smart young woman opened the door.\\n\"I\\'ve come about the place,\" said Tuppence.\\n\"It\\'s a rotten place,\" said the young woman without hesitation.\\n\"Regular old cat--always interfering. Accused me of tampering\\nwith her letters. Me! The flap was half undone anyway. There\\'s\\nnever anything in the waste-paper basket--she burns everything.\\nShe\\'s a wrong \\'un, that\\'s what she is. Swell clothes, but no\\nclass. Cook knows something about her--but she won\\'t\\ntell--scared to death of her. And suspicious! She\\'s on to you in\\na minute if you as much as speak to a fellow. I can tell you----\"\\nBut what more Annie could tell, Tuppence was never destined to\\nlearn, for at that moment a clear voice with a peculiarly steely\\nring to it called:\\n\"Annie!\"\\nThe smart young woman jumped as if she had been shot.\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am.\"\\n\"Who are you talking to?\"\\n\"It\\'s a young woman about the situation, ma\\'am.\"\\n\"Show her in then. At once.\"\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am.\"\\nTuppence was ushered into a room on the right of the long\\npassage. A woman was standing by the fireplace. She was no\\nlonger in her first youth, and the beauty she undeniably\\npossessed was hardened and coarsened. In her youth she must have\\nbeen dazzling. Her pale gold hair, owing a slight assistance to\\nart, was coiled low on her neck, her eyes, of a piercing electric\\nblue, seemed to possess a faculty of boring into the very soul of\\nthe person she was looking at. Her exquisite figure was enhanced\\nby a wonderful gown of indigo charmeuse. And yet, despite her\\nswaying grace, and the almost ethereal beauty of her face, you\\nfelt instinctively the presence of something hard and menacing, a\\nkind of metallic strength that found expression in the tones of\\nher voice and in that gimletlike quality of her eyes.\\nFor the first time Tuppence felt afraid. She had not feared\\nWhittington, but this woman was different. As if fascinated, she\\nwatched the long cruel line of the red curving mouth, and again\\nshe felt that sensation of panic pass over her. Her usual\\nself-confidence deserted her. Vaguely she felt that deceiving\\nthis woman would be very different to deceiving Whittington. Mr.\\nCarter\\'s warning recurred to her mind. Here, indeed, she might\\nexpect no mercy.\\nFighting down that instinct of panic which urged her to turn tail\\nand run without further delay, Tuppence returned the lady\\'s gaze\\nfirmly and respectfully.\\nAs though that first scrutiny had been satisfactory, Mrs.\\nVandemeyer motioned to a chair.\\n\"You can sit down. How did you hear I wanted a\\nhouse-parlourmaid?\"\\n\"Through a friend who knows the lift boy here. He thought the\\nplace might suit me.\"\\nAgain that basilisk glance seemed to pierce her through.\\n\"You speak like an educated girl?\"\\nGlibly enough, Tuppence ran through her imaginary career on the\\nlines suggested by Mr. Carter. It seemed to her, as she did so,\\nthat the tension of Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s attitude relaxed.\\n\"I see,\" she remarked at length. \"Is there anyone I can write to\\nfor a reference?\"\\n\"I lived last with a Miss Dufferin, The Parsonage, Llanelly. I\\nwas with her two years.\"\\n\"And then you thought you would get more money by coming to\\nLondon, I suppose? Well, it doesn\\'t matter to me. I will give\\nyou L50--L60--whatever you want. You can come in at once?\"\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am. To-day, if you like. My box is at Paddington.\"\\n\"Go and fetch it in a taxi, then. It\\'s an easy place. I am out\\na good deal. By the way, what\\'s your name?\"\\n\"Prudence Cooper, ma\\'am.\"\\n\"Very well, Prudence. Go away and fetch your box. I shall be\\nout to lunch. The cook will show you where everything is.\"\\n\"Thank you, ma\\'am.\"\\nTuppence withdrew. The smart Annie was not in evidence. In the\\nhall below a magnificent hall porter had relegated Albert to the\\nbackground. Tuppence did not even glance at him as she passed\\nmeekly out.\\nThe adventure had begun, but she felt less elated than she had\\ndone earlier in the morning. It crossed her mind that if the\\nunknown Jane Finn had fallen into the hands of Mrs. Vandemeyer,\\nit was likely to have gone hard with her.\\nCHAPTER X\\nENTER SIR JAMES PEEL EDGERTON\\nTUPPENCE betrayed no awkwardness in her new duties. The daughters\\nof the archdeacon were well grounded in household tasks. They\\nwere also experts in training a \"raw girl,\" the inevitable result\\nbeing that the raw girl, once trained, departed elsewhere where\\nher newly acquired knowledge commanded a more substantial\\nremuneration than the archdeacon\\'s meagre purse allowed.\\nTuppence had therefore very little fear of proving inefficient.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s cook puzzled her. She evidently went in deadly\\nterror of her mistress. The girl thought it probable that the\\nother woman had some hold over her. For the rest, she cooked\\nlike a chef, as Tuppence had an opportunity of judging that\\nevening. Mrs. Vandemeyer was expecting a guest to dinner, and\\nTuppence accordingly laid the beautifully polished table for two.\\nShe was a little exercised in her own mind as to this visitor. It\\nwas highly possible that it might prove to be Whittington.\\nAlthough she felt fairly confident that he would not recognize\\nher, yet she would have been better pleased had the guest proved\\nto be a total stranger. However, there was nothing for it but to\\nhope for the best.\\nAt a few minutes past eight the front door bell rang, and\\nTuppence went to answer it with some inward trepidation. She was\\nrelieved to see that the visitor was the second of the two men\\nwhom Tommy had taken upon himself to follow.\\nHe gave his name as Count Stepanov. Tuppence announced him, and\\nMrs. Vandemeyer rose from her seat on a low divan with a quick\\nmurmur of pleasure.\\n\"It is delightful to see you, Boris Ivanovitch,\" she said.\\n\"And you, madame!\" He bowed low over her hand.\\nTuppence returned to the kitchen.\\n\"Count Stepanov, or some such,\" she remarked, and affecting a\\nfrank and unvarnished curiosity: \"Who\\'s he?\"\\n\"A Russian gentleman, I believe.\"\\n\"Come here much?\"\\n\"Once in a while. What d\\'you want to know for?\"\\n\"Fancied he might be sweet on the missus, that\\'s all,\" explained\\nthe girl, adding with an appearance of sulkiness: \"How you do\\ntake one up!\"\\n\"I\\'m not quite easy in my mind about the souffle,\" explained the\\nother.\\n\"You know something,\" thought Tuppence to herself, but aloud she\\nonly said: \"Going to dish up now? Right-o.\"\\nWhilst waiting at table, Tuppence listened closely to all that\\nwas said. She remembered that this was one of the men Tommy was\\nshadowing when she had last seen him. Already, although she\\nwould hardly admit it, she was becoming uneasy about her partner.\\nWhere was he? Why had no word of any kind come from him? She had\\narranged before leaving the Ritz to have all letters or messages\\nsent on at once by special messenger to a small stationer\\'s shop\\nnear at hand where Albert was to call in frequently. True, it was\\nonly yesterday morning that she had parted from Tommy, and she\\ntold herself that any anxiety on his behalf would be absurd.\\nStill, it was strange that he had sent no word of any kind.\\nBut, listen as she might, the conversation presented no clue.\\nBoris and Mrs. Vandemeyer talked on purely indifferent subjects:\\nplays they had seen, new dances, and the latest society gossip.\\nAfter dinner they repaired to the small boudoir where Mrs.\\nVandemeyer, stretched on the divan, looked more wickedly\\nbeautiful than ever. Tuppence brought in the coffee and liqueurs\\nand unwillingly retired. As she did so, she heard Boris say:\\n\"New, isn\\'t she?\"\\n\"She came in to-day. The other was a fiend. This girl seems all\\nright. She waits well.\"\\nTuppence lingered a moment longer by the door which she had\\ncarefully neglected to close, and heard him say:\\n\"Quite safe, I suppose?\"\\n\"Really, Boris, you are absurdly suspicious. I believe she\\'s the\\ncousin of the hall porter, or something of the kind. And nobody\\neven dreams that I have any connection with our--mutual friend,\\nMr. Brown.\"\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, be careful, Rita. That door isn\\'t shut.\"\\n\"Well, shut it then,\" laughed the woman.\\nTuppence removed herself speedily.\\nShe dared not absent herself longer from the back premises, but\\nshe cleared away and washed up with a breathless speed acquired\\nin hospital. Then she slipped quietly back to the boudoir door.\\nThe cook, more leisurely, was still busy in the kitchen and, if\\nshe missed the other, would only suppose her to be turning down\\nthe beds.\\nAlas! The conversation inside was being carried on in too low a\\ntone to permit of her hearing anything of it. She dared not\\nreopen the door, however gently. Mrs. Vandemeyer was sitting\\nalmost facing it, and Tuppence respected her mistress\\'s lynx-eyed\\npowers of observation.\\nNevertheless, she felt she would give a good deal to overhear\\nwhat was going on. Possibly, if anything unforeseen had\\nhappened, she might get news of Tommy. For some moments she\\nreflected desperately, then her face brightened. She went quickly\\nalong the passage to Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s bedroom, which had long\\nFrench windows leading on to a balcony that ran the length of the\\nflat. Slipping quickly through the window, Tuppence crept\\nnoiselessly along till she reached the boudoir window. As she had\\nthought it stood a little ajar, and the voices within were\\nplainly audible.\\nTuppence listened attentively, but there was no mention of\\nanything that could be twisted to apply to Tommy. Mrs.\\nVandemeyer and the Russian seemed to be at variance over some\\nmatter, and finally the latter exclaimed bitterly:\\n\"With your persistent recklessness, you will end by ruining us!\"\\n\"Bah!\" laughed the woman. \"Notoriety of the right kind is the\\nbest way of disarming suspicion. You will realize that one of\\nthese days--perhaps sooner than you think!\"\\n\"In the meantime, you are going about everywhere with Peel\\nEdgerton. Not only is he, perhaps, the most celebrated K.C. in\\nEngland, but his special hobby is criminology! It is madness!\"\\n\"I know that his eloquence has saved untold men from the\\ngallows,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer calmly. \"What of it? I may need\\nhis assistance in that line myself some day. If so, how fortunate\\nto have such a friend at court--or perhaps it would be more to\\nthe point to say IN court.\"\\nBoris got up and began striding up and down. He was very\\nexcited.\\n\"You are a clever woman, Rita; but you are also a fool! Be guided\\nby me, and give up Peel Edgerton.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer shook her head gently.\\n\"I think not.\"\\n\"You refuse?\" There was an ugly ring in the Russian\\'s voice.\\n\"I do.\"\\n\"Then, by Heaven,\" snarled the Russian, \"we will see----\" But\\nMrs. Vandemeyer also rose to her feet, her eyes flashing.\\n\"You forget, Boris,\" she said. \"I am accountable to no one. I\\ntake my orders only from--Mr. Brown.\"\\nThe other threw up his hands in despair.\\n\"You are impossible,\" he muttered. \"Impossible! Already it may\\nbe too late. They say Peel Edgerton can SMELL a criminal! How do\\nwe know what is at the bottom of his sudden interest in you?\\nPerhaps even now his suspicions are aroused. He guesses----\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer eyed him scornfully.\\n\"Reassure yourself, my dear Boris. He suspects nothing. With\\nless than your usual chivalry, you seem to forget that I am\\ncommonly accounted a beautiful woman. I assure you that is all\\nthat interests Peel Edgerton.\"\\nBoris shook his head doubtfully.\\n\"He has studied crime as no other man in this kingdom has studied\\nit. Do you fancy that you can deceive him?\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s eyes narrowed.\\n\"If he is all that you say--it would amuse me to try!\"\\n\"Good heavens, Rita----\"\\n\"Besides,\" added Mrs. Vandemeyer, \"he is extremely rich. I am not\\none who despises money. The \\'sinews of war,\\' you know, Boris!\"\\n\"Money--money! That is always the danger with you, Rita. I\\nbelieve you would sell your soul for money. I believe----\" He\\npaused, then in a low, sinister voice he said slowly: \"Sometimes\\nI believe that you would sell--us!\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer smiled and shrugged her shoulders.\\n\"The price, at any rate, would have to be enormous,\" she said\\nlightly. \"It would be beyond the power of anyone but a\\nmillionaire to pay.\"\\n\"Ah!\" snarled the Russian. \"You see, I was right!\"\\n\"My dear Boris, can you not take a joke?\"\\n\"Was it a joke?\"\\n\"Of course.\"\\n\"Then all I can say is that your ideas of humour are peculiar, my\\ndear Rita.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer smiled.\\n\"Let us not quarrel, Boris. Touch the bell. We will have some\\ndrinks.\"\\nTuppence beat a hasty retreat. She paused a moment to survey\\nherself in Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s long glass, and be sure that nothing\\nwas amiss with her appearance. Then she answered the bell\\ndemurely.\\nThe conversation that she had overheard, although interesting in\\nthat it proved beyond doubt the complicity of both Rita and\\nBoris, threw very little light on the present preoccupations. The\\nname of Jane Finn had not even been mentioned.\\nThe following morning a few brief words with Albert informed her\\nthat nothing was waiting for her at the stationer\\'s. It seemed\\nincredible that Tommy, if all was well with him, should not send\\nany word to her. A cold hand seemed to close round her heart....\\nSupposing ... She choked her fears down bravely. It was no good\\nworrying. But she leapt at a chance offered her by Mrs.\\nVandemeyer.\\n\"What day do you usually go out, Prudence?\"\\n\"Friday\\'s my usual day, ma\\'am.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer lifted her eyebrows.\\n\"And to-day is Friday! But I suppose you hardly wish to go out\\nto-day, as you only came yesterday.\"\\n\"I was thinking of asking you if I might, ma\\'am.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer looked at her a minute longer, and then smiled.\\n\"I wish Count Stepanov could hear you. He made a suggestion\\nabout you last night.\" Her smile broadened, catlike. \"Your\\nrequest is very--typical. I am satisfied. You do not understand\\nall this--but you can go out to-day. It makes no difference to\\nme, as I shall not be dining at home.\"\\n\"Thank you, ma\\'am.\"\\nTuppence felt a sensation of relief once she was out of the\\nother\\'s presence. Once again she admitted to herself that she was\\nafraid, horribly afraid, of the beautiful woman with the cruel\\neyes.\\nIn the midst of a final desultory polishing of her silver,\\nTuppence was disturbed by the ringing of the front door bell, and\\nwent to answer it. This time the visitor was neither Whittington\\nnor Boris, but a man of striking appearance.\\nJust a shade over average height, he nevertheless conveyed the\\nimpression of a big man. His face, clean-shaven and exquisitely\\nmobile, was stamped with an expression of power and force far\\nbeyond the ordinary. Magnetism seemed to radiate from him.\\nTuppence was undecided for the moment whether to put him down as\\nan actor or a lawyer, but her doubts were soon solved as he gave\\nher his name: Sir James Peel Edgerton.\\nShe looked at him with renewed interest. This, then, was the\\nfamous K.C. whose name was familiar all over England. She had\\nheard it said that he might one day be Prime Minister. He was\\nknown to have refused office in the interests of his profession,\\npreferring to remain a simple Member for a Scotch constituency.\\nTuppence went back to her pantry thoughtfully. The great man had\\nimpressed her. She understood Boris\\'s agitation. Peel Edgerton\\nwould not be an easy man to deceive.\\nIn about a quarter of an hour the bell rang, and Tuppence\\nrepaired to the hall to show the visitor out. He had given her a\\npiercing glance before. Now, as she handed him his hat and\\nstick, she was conscious of his eyes raking her through. As she\\nopened the door and stood aside to let him pass out, he stopped\\nin the doorway.\\n\"Not been doing this long, eh?\"\\nTuppence raised her eyes, astonished. She read in his glance\\nkindliness, and something else more difficult to fathom.\\nHe nodded as though she had answered.\\n\"V.A.D. and hard up, I suppose?\"\\n\"Did Mrs. Vandemeyer tell you that?\" asked Tuppence suspiciously.\\n\"No, child. The look of you told me. Good place here?\"\\n\"Very good, thank you, sir.\"\\n\"Ah, but there are plenty of good places nowadays. And a change\\ndoes no harm sometimes.\"\\n\"Do you mean----?\" began Tuppence.\\nBut Sir James was already on the topmost stair. He looked back\\nwith his kindly, shrewd glance.\\n\"Just a hint,\" he said. \"That\\'s all.\"\\nTuppence went back to the pantry more thoughtful than ever.\\nCHAPTER XI\\nJULIUS TELLS A STORY\\nDRESSED appropriately, Tuppence duly sallied forth for her\\n\"afternoon out.\" Albert was in temporary abeyance, but Tuppence\\nwent herself to the stationer\\'s to make quite sure that nothing\\nhad come for her. Satisfied on this point, she made her way to\\nthe Ritz. On inquiry she learnt that Tommy had not yet returned.\\nIt was the answer she had expected, but it was another nail in\\nthe coffin of her hopes. She resolved to appeal to Mr. Carter,\\ntelling him when and where Tommy had started on his quest, and\\nasking him to do something to trace him. The prospect of his aid\\nrevived her mercurial spirits, and she next inquired for Julius\\nHersheimmer. The reply she got was to the effect that he had\\nreturned about half an hour ago, but had gone out immediately.\\nTuppence\\'s spirits revived still more. It would be something to\\nsee Julius. Perhaps he could devise some plan for finding out\\nwhat had become of Tommy. She wrote her note to Mr. Carter in\\nJulius\\'s sitting-room, and was just addressing the envelope when\\nthe door burst open.\\n\"What the hell----\" began Julius, but checked himself abruptly.\\n\"I beg your pardon, Miss Tuppence. Those fools down at the\\noffice would have it that Beresford wasn\\'t here any\\nlonger--hadn\\'t been here since Wednesday. Is that so?\"\\nTuppence nodded.\\n\"You don\\'t know where he is?\" she asked faintly.\\n\"I? How should I know? I haven\\'t had one darned word from him,\\nthough I wired him yesterday morning.\"\\n\"I expect your wire\\'s at the office unopened.\"\\n\"But where is he?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know. I hoped you might.\"\\n\"I tell you I haven\\'t had one darned word from him since we\\nparted at the depot on Wednesday.\"\\n\"What depot?\"\\n\"Waterloo. Your London and South Western road.\"\\n\"Waterloo?\" frowned Tuppence.\\n\"Why, yes. Didn\\'t he tell you?\"\\n\"I haven\\'t seen him either,\" replied Tuppence impatiently. \"Go on\\nabout Waterloo. What were you doing there?\"\\n\"He gave me a call. Over the phone. Told me to get a move on,\\nand hustle. Said he was trailing two crooks.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence, her eyes opening. \"I see. Go on.\"\\n\"I hurried along right away. Beresford was there. He pointed\\nout the crooks. The big one was mine, the guy you bluffed. Tommy\\nshoved a ticket into my hand and told me to get aboard the cars.\\nHe was going to sleuth the other crook.\" Julius paused. \"I\\nthought for sure you\\'d know all this.\"\\n\"Julius,\" said Tuppence firmly, \"stop walking up and down. It\\nmakes me giddy. Sit down in that armchair, and tell me the whole\\nstory with as few fancy turns of speech as possible.\"\\nMr. Hersheimmer obeyed.\\n\"Sure,\" he said. \"Where shall I begin?\"\\n\"Where you left off. At Waterloo.\"\\n\"Well,\" began Julius, \"I got into one of your dear old-fashioned\\nfirst-class British compartments. The train was just off. First\\nthing I knew a guard came along and informed me mighty politely\\nthat I wasn\\'t in a smoking-carriage. I handed him out half a\\ndollar, and that settled that. I did a bit of prospecting along\\nthe corridor to the next coach. Whittington was there right\\nenough. When I saw the skunk, with his big sleek fat face, and\\nthought of poor little Jane in his clutches, I felt real mad that\\nI hadn\\'t got a gun with me. I\\'d have tickled him up some.\\n\"We got to Bournemouth all right. Whittington took a cab and\\ngave the name of an hotel. I did likewise, and we drove up\\nwithin three minutes of each other. He hired a room, and I hired\\none too. So far it was all plain sailing. He hadn\\'t the remotest\\nnotion that anyone was on to him. Well, he just sat around in\\nthe hotel lounge, reading the papers and so on, till it was time\\nfor dinner. He didn\\'t hurry any over that either.\\n\"I began to think that there was nothing doing, that he\\'d just\\ncome on the trip for his health, but I remembered that he hadn\\'t\\nchanged for dinner, though it was by way of being a slap-up\\nhotel, so it seemed likely enough that he\\'d be going out on his\\nreal business afterwards.\\n\"Sure enough, about nine o\\'clock, so he did. Took a car across\\nthe town--mighty pretty place by the way, I guess I\\'ll take Jane\\nthere for a spell when I find her--and then paid it off and\\nstruck out along those pine-woods on the top of the cliff. I was\\nthere too, you understand. We walked, maybe, for half an hour.\\nThere\\'s a lot of villas all the way along, but by degrees they\\nseemed to get more and more thinned out, and in the end we got to\\none that seemed the last of the bunch. Big house it was, with a\\nlot of piny grounds around it.\\n\"It was a pretty black night, and the carriage drive up to the\\nhouse was dark as pitch. I could hear him ahead, though I\\ncouldn\\'t see him. I had to walk carefully in case he might get on\\nto it that he was being followed. I turned a curve and I was\\njust in time to see him ring the bell and get admitted to the\\nhouse. I just stopped where I was. It was beginning to rain, and\\nI was soon pretty near soaked through. Also, it was almighty\\ncold.\\n\"Whittington didn\\'t come out again, and by and by I got kind of\\nrestive, and began to mouch around. All the ground floor windows\\nwere shuttered tight, but upstairs, on the first floor (it was a\\ntwo-storied house) I noticed a window with a light burning and\\nthe curtains not drawn.\\n\"Now, just opposite to that window, there was a tree growing. It\\nwas about thirty foot away from the house, maybe, and I sort of\\ngot it into my head that, if I climbed up that tree, I\\'d very\\nlikely be able to see into that room. Of course, I knew there\\nwas no reason why Whittington should be in that room rather than\\nin any other--less reason, in fact, for the betting would be on\\nhis being in one of the reception-rooms downstairs. But I guess\\nI\\'d got the hump from standing so long in the rain, and anything\\nseemed better than going on doing nothing. So I started up.\\n\"It wasn\\'t so easy, by a long chalk! The rain had made the\\nboughs mighty slippery, and it was all I could do to keep a\\nfoothold, but bit by bit I managed it, until at last there I was\\nlevel with the window.\\n\"But then I was disappointed. I was too far to the left. I could\\nonly see sideways into the room. A bit of curtain, and a yard of\\nwallpaper was all I could command. Well, that wasn\\'t any manner\\nof good to me, but just as I was going to give it up, and climb\\ndown ignominiously, some one inside moved and threw his shadow on\\nmy little bit of wall--and, by gum, it was Whittington!\\n\"After that, my blood was up. I\\'d just got to get a look into\\nthat room. It was up to me to figure out how. I noticed that\\nthere was a long branch running out from the tree in the right\\ndirection. If I could only swarm about half-way along it, the\\nproposition would be solved. But it was mighty uncertain whether\\nit would bear my weight. I decided I\\'d just got to risk that, and\\nI started. Very cautiously, inch by inch, I crawled along. The\\nbough creaked and swayed in a nasty fashion, and it didn\\'t do to\\nthink of the drop below, but at last I got safely to where I\\nwanted to be.\\n\"The room was medium-sized, furnished in a kind of bare hygienic\\nway. There was a table with a lamp on it in the middle of the\\nroom, and sitting at that table, facing towards me, was\\nWhittington right enough. He was talking to a woman dressed as a\\nhospital nurse. She was sitting with her back to me, so I\\ncouldn\\'t see her face. Although the blinds were up, the window\\nitself was shut, so I couldn\\'t catch a word of what they said.\\nWhittington seemed to be doing all the talking, and the nurse\\njust listened. Now and then she nodded, and sometimes she\\'d shake\\nher head, as though she were answering questions. He seemed very\\nemphatic--once or twice he beat with his fist on the table. The\\nrain had stopped now, and the sky was clearing in that sudden way\\nit does.\\n\"Presently, he seemed to get to the end of what he was saying.\\nHe got up, and so did she. He looked towards the window and\\nasked something--I guess it was whether it was raining. Anyway,\\nshe came right across and looked out. Just then the moon came out\\nfrom behind the clouds. I was scared the woman would catch sight\\nof me, for I was full in the moonlight. I tried to move back a\\nbit. The jerk I gave was too much for that rotten old branch.\\nWith an almighty crash, down it came, and Julius P. Hersheimmer\\nwith it!\"\\n\"Oh, Julius,\" breathed Tuppence, \"how exciting! Go on.\"\\n\"Well, luckily for me, I pitched down into a good soft bed of\\nearth--but it put me out of action for the time, sure enough. The\\nnext thing I knew, I was lying in bed with a hospital nurse (not\\nWhittington\\'s one) on one side of me, and a little black-bearded\\nman with gold glasses, and medical man written all over him, on\\nthe other. He rubbed his hands together, and raised his eyebrows\\nas I stared at him. \\'Ah!\\' he said. \\'So our young friend is\\ncoming round again. Capital. Capital.\\'\\n\"I did the usual stunt. Said: \\'What\\'s happened?\\' And \\'Where am\\nI?\\' But I knew the answer to the last well enough. There\\'s no\\nmoss growing on my brain. \\'I think that\\'ll do for the present,\\nsister,\\' said the little man, and the nurse left the room in a\\nsort of brisk well-trained way. But I caught her handing me out a\\nlook of deep curiosity as she passed through the door.\\n\"That look of hers gave me an idea. \\'Now then, doc,\\' I said, and\\ntried to sit up in bed, but my right foot gave me a nasty twinge\\nas I did so. \\'A slight sprain,\\' explained the doctor. \\'Nothing\\nserious. You\\'ll be about again in a couple of days.\\' \"\\n\"I noticed you walked lame,\" interpolated Tuppence.\\nJulius nodded, and continued:\\n\" \\'How did it happen?\\' I asked again. He replied dryly. \\'You\\nfell, with a considerable portion of one of my trees, into one of\\nmy newly planted flower-beds.\\'\\n\"I liked the man. He seemed to have a sense of humour. I felt\\nsure that he, at least, was plumb straight. \\'Sure, doc,\\' I said,\\n\\'I\\'m sorry about the tree, and I guess the new bulbs will be on\\nme. But perhaps you\\'d like to know what I was doing in your\\ngarden?\\' \\'I think the facts do call for an explanation,\\' he\\nreplied. \\'Well, to begin with, I wasn\\'t after the spoons.\\'\\n\"He smiled. \\'My first theory. But I soon altered my mind. By\\nthe way, you are an American, are you not?\\' I told him my name.\\n\\'And you?\\' \\'I am Dr. Hall, and this, as you doubtless know, is\\nmy private nursing home.\\'\\n\"I didn\\'t know, but I wasn\\'t going to put him wise. I was just\\nthankful for the information. I liked the man, and I felt he was\\nstraight, but I wasn\\'t going to give him the whole story. For one\\nthing he probably wouldn\\'t have believed it.\\n\"I made up my mind in a flash. \\'Why, doctor,\\' I said, \\'I guess I\\nfeel an almighty fool, but I owe it to you to let you know that\\nit wasn\\'t the Bill Sikes business I was up to.\\' Then I went on\\nand mumbled out something about a girl. I trotted out the stern\\nguardian business, and a nervous breakdown, and finally explained\\nthat I had fancied I recognized her among the patients at the\\nhome, hence my nocturnal adventures. I guess it was just the\\nkind of story he was expecting. \\'Quite a romance,\\' he said\\ngenially, when I\\'d finished. \\'Now, doc,\\' I went on, \\'will you be\\nfrank with me? Have you here now, or have you had here at any\\ntime, a young girl called Jane Finn?\\' He repeated the name\\nthoughtfully. \\'Jane Finn?\\' he said. \\'No.\\'\\n\"I was chagrined, and I guess I showed it. \\'You are sure?\\'\\n\\'Quite sure, Mr. Hersheimmer. It is an uncommon name, and I\\nshould not have been likely to forget it.\\'\\n\"Well, that was flat. It laid me out for a space. I\\'d kind of\\nhoped my search was at an end. \\'That\\'s that,\\' I said at last.\\n\\'Now, there\\'s another matter. When I was hugging that darned\\nbranch I thought I recognized an old friend of mine talking to\\none of your nurses.\\' I purposely didn\\'t mention any name\\nbecause, of course, Whittington might be calling himself\\nsomething quite different down here, but the doctor answered at\\nonce. \\'Mr. Whittington, perhaps?\\' \\'That\\'s the fellow,\\' I\\nreplied. \\'What\\'s he doing down here? Don\\'t tell me HIS nerves\\nare out of order?\\'\\n\"Dr. Hall laughed. \\'No. He came down to see one of my nurses,\\nNurse Edith, who is a niece of his.\\' \\'Why, fancy that!\\' I\\nexclaimed. \\'Is he still here?\\' \\'No, he went back to town almost\\nimmediately.\\' \\'What a pity!\\' I ejaculated. \\'But perhaps I could\\nspeak to his niece--Nurse Edith, did you say her name was?\\'\\n\"But the doctor shook his head. \\'I\\'m afraid that, too, is\\nimpossible. Nurse Edith left with a patient to-night also.\\' \\'I\\nseem to be real unlucky,\\' I remarked. \\'Have you Mr.\\nWhittington\\'s address in town? I guess I\\'d like to look him up\\nwhen I get back.\\' \\'I don\\'t know his address. I can write to\\nNurse Edith for it if you like.\\' I thanked him. \\'Don\\'t say who\\nit is wants it. I\\'d like to give him a little surprise.\\'\\n\"That was about all I could do for the moment. Of course, if the\\ngirl was really Whittington\\'s niece, she might be too cute to\\nfall into the trap, but it was worth trying. Next thing I did\\nwas to write out a wire to Beresford saying where I was, and that\\nI was laid up with a sprained foot, and telling him to come down\\nif he wasn\\'t busy. I had to be guarded in what I said. However,\\nI didn\\'t hear from him, and my foot soon got all right. It was\\nonly ricked, not really sprained, so to-day I said good-bye to\\nthe little doctor chap, asked him to send me word if he heard\\nfrom Nurse Edith, and came right away back to town. Say, Miss\\nTuppence, you\\'re looking mighty pale!\"\\n\"It\\'s Tommy,\" said Tuppence. \"What can have happened to him?\"\\n\"Buck up, I guess he\\'s all right really. Why shouldn\\'t he be?\\nSee here, it was a foreign-looking guy he went off after. Maybe\\nthey\\'ve gone abroad--to Poland, or something like that?\"\\nTuppence shook her head.\\n\"He couldn\\'t without passports and things. Besides I\\'ve seen\\nthat man, Boris Something, since. He dined with Mrs. Vandemeyer\\nlast night.\"\\n\"Mrs. Who?\"\\n\"I forgot. Of course you don\\'t know all that.\"\\n\"I\\'m listening,\" said Julius, and gave vent to his favourite\\nexpression. \"Put me wise.\"\\nTuppence thereupon related the events of the last two days.\\nJulius\\'s astonishment and admiration were unbounded.\\n\"Bully for you! Fancy you a menial. It just tickles me to\\ndeath!\" Then he added seriously: \"But say now, I don\\'t like it,\\nMiss Tuppence, I sure don\\'t. You\\'re just as plucky as they make\\n\\'em, but I wish you\\'d keep right out of this. These crooks we\\'re\\nup against would as soon croak a girl as a man any day.\"\\n\"Do you think I\\'m afraid?\" said Tuppence indignantly, valiantly\\nrepressing memories of the steely glitter in Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s\\neyes.\\n\"I said before you were darned plucky. But that doesn\\'t alter\\nfacts.\"\\n\"Oh, bother ME!\" said Tuppence impatiently. \"Let\\'s think about\\nwhat can have happened to Tommy. I\\'ve written to Mr. Carter\\nabout it,\" she added, and told him the gist of her letter.\\nJulius nodded gravely.\\n\"I guess that\\'s good as far as it goes. But it\\'s for us to get\\nbusy and do something.\"\\n\"What can we do?\" asked Tuppence, her spirits rising.\\n\"I guess we\\'d better get on the track of Boris. You say he\\'s\\nbeen to your place. Is he likely to come again?\"\\n\"He might. I really don\\'t know.\"\\n\"I see. Well, I guess I\\'d better buy a car, a slap-up one, dress\\nas a chauffeur and hang about outside. Then if Boris comes, you\\ncould make some kind of signal, and I\\'d trail him. How\\'s that?\"\\n\"Splendid, but he mightn\\'t come for weeks.\"\\n\"We\\'ll have to chance that. I\\'m glad you like the plan.\" He\\nrose.\\n\"Where are you going?\"\\n\"To buy the car, of course,\" replied Julius, surprised. \"What\\nmake do you like? I guess you\\'ll do some riding in it before\\nwe\\'ve finished.\"\\n\"Oh,\" said Tuppence faintly, \"I LIKE Rolls-Royces, but----\"\\n\"Sure,\" agreed Julius. \"What you say goes. I\\'ll get one.\"\\n\"But you can\\'t at once,\" cried Tuppence. \"People wait ages\\nsometimes.\"\\n\"Little Julius doesn\\'t,\" affirmed Mr. Hersheimmer. \"Don\\'t you\\nworry any. I\\'ll be round in the car in half an hour.\"\\nTuppence got up.\\n\"You\\'re awfully good, Julius. But I can\\'t help feeling that it\\'s\\nrather a forlorn hope. I\\'m really pinning my faith to Mr.\\nCarter.\"\\n\"Then I shouldn\\'t.\"\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Just an idea of mine.\"\\n\"Oh; but he must do something. There\\'s no one else. By the way,\\nI forgot to tell you of a queer thing that happened this\\nmorning.\"\\nAnd she narrated her encounter with Sir James Peel Edgerton.\\nJulius was interested.\\n\"What did the guy mean, do you think?\" he asked.\\n\"I don\\'t quite know,\" said Tuppence meditatively. \"But I think\\nthat, in an ambiguous, legal, without prejudishish lawyer\\'s way,\\nhe was trying to warn me.\"\\n\"Why should he?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" confessed Tuppence. \"But he looked kind, and\\nsimply awfully clever. I wouldn\\'t mind going to him and telling\\nhim everything.\"\\nSomewhat to her surprise, Julius negatived the idea sharply.\\n\"See here,\" he said, \"we don\\'t want any lawyers mixed up in this.\\nThat guy couldn\\'t help us any.\"\\n\"Well, I believe he could,\" reiterated Tuppence obstinately.\\n\"Don\\'t you think it. So long. I\\'ll be back in half an hour.\"\\nThirty-five minutes had elapsed when Julius returned. He took\\nTuppence by the arm, and walked her to the window.\\n\"There she is.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence with a note of reverence in her voice, as she\\ngazed down at the enormous car.\\n\"She\\'s some pace-maker, I can tell you,\" said Julius\\ncomplacently.\\n\"How did you get it?\" gasped Tuppence.\\n\"She was just being sent home to some bigwig.\"\\n\"Well?\"\\n\"I went round to his house,\" said Julius. \"I said that I\\nreckoned a car like that was worth every penny of twenty thousand\\ndollars. Then I told him that it was worth just about fifty\\nthousand dollars to me if he\\'d get out.\"\\n\"Well?\" said Tuppence, intoxicated.\\n\"Well,\" returned Julius, \"he got out, that\\'s all.\"\\nCHAPTER XII\\nA FRIEND IN NEED\\nFRIDAY and Saturday passed uneventfully. Tuppence had received a\\nbrief answer to her appeal from Mr. Carter. In it he pointed out\\nthat the Young Adventurers had undertaken the work at their own\\nrisk, and had been fully warned of the dangers. If anything had\\nhappened to Tommy he regretted it deeply, but he could do\\nnothing.\\nThis was cold comfort. Somehow, without Tommy, all the savour\\nwent out of the adventure, and, for the first time, Tuppence felt\\ndoubtful of success. While they had been together she had never\\nquestioned it for a minute. Although she was accustomed to take\\nthe lead, and to pride herself on her quick-wittedness, in\\nreality she had relied upon Tommy more than she realized at the\\ntime. There was something so eminently sober and clear-headed\\nabout him, his common sense and soundness of vision were so\\nunvarying, that without him Tuppence felt much like a rudderless\\nship. It was curious that Julius, who was undoubtedly much\\ncleverer than Tommy, did not give her the same feeling of\\nsupport. She had accused Tommy of being a pessimist, and it is\\ncertain that he always saw the disadvantages and difficulties\\nwhich she herself was optimistically given to overlooking, but\\nnevertheless she had really relied a good deal on his judgment.\\nHe might be slow, but he was very sure.\\nIt seemed to the girl that, for the first time, she realized the\\nsinister character of the mission they had undertaken so\\nlightheartedly. It had begun like a page of romance. Now, shorn\\nof its glamour, it seemed to be turning to grim reality.\\nTommy--that was all that mattered. Many times in the day Tuppence\\nblinked the tears out of her eyes resolutely. \"Little fool,\" she\\nwould apostrophize herself, \"don\\'t snivel. Of course you\\'re fond\\nof him. You\\'ve known him all your life. But there\\'s no need to\\nbe sentimental about it.\"\\nIn the meantime, nothing more was seen of Boris. He did not come\\nto the flat, and Julius and the car waited in vain. Tuppence\\ngave herself over to new meditations. Whilst admitting the truth\\nof Julius\\'s objections, she had nevertheless not entirely\\nrelinquished the idea of appealing to Sir James Peel Edgerton.\\nIndeed, she had gone so far as to look up his address in the Red\\nBook. Had he meant to warn her that day? If so, why? Surely she\\nwas at least entitled to demand an explanation. He had looked at\\nher so kindly. Perhaps he might tell them something concerning\\nMrs. Vandemeyer which might lead to a clue to Tommy\\'s\\nwhereabouts.\\nAnyway, Tuppence decided, with her usual shake of the shoulders,\\nit was worth trying, and try it she would. Sunday was her\\nafternoon out. She would meet Julius, persuade him to her point\\nof view, and they would beard the lion in his den.\\nWhen the day arrived Julius needed a considerable amount of\\npersuading, but Tuppence held firm. \"It can do no harm,\" was\\nwhat she always came back to. In the end Julius gave in, and\\nthey proceeded in the car to Carlton House Terrace.\\nThe door was opened by an irreproachable butler. Tuppence felt a\\nlittle nervous. After all, perhaps it WAS colossal cheek on her\\npart. She had decided not to ask if Sir James was \"at home,\" but\\nto adopt a more personal attitude.\\n\"Will you ask Sir James if I can see him for a few minutes? I\\nhave an important message for him.\"\\nThe butler retired, returning a moment or two later.\\n\"Sir James will see you. Will you step this way?\"\\nHe ushered them into a room at the back of the house, furnished\\nas a library. The collection of books was a magnificent one, and\\nTuppence noticed that all one wall was devoted to works on crime\\nand criminology. There were several deep-padded leather\\narm-chairs, and an old-fashioned open hearth. In the window was a\\nbig roll-top desk strewn with papers at which the master of the\\nhouse was sitting.\\nHe rose as they entered.\\n\"You have a message for me? Ah\"--he recognized Tuppence with a\\nsmile--\"it\\'s you, is it? Brought a message from Mrs. Vandemeyer,\\nI suppose?\"\\n\"Not exactly,\" said Tuppence. \"In fact, I\\'m afraid I only said\\nthat to be quite sure of getting in. Oh, by the way, this is Mr.\\nHersheimmer, Sir James Peel Edgerton.\"\\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" said the American, shooting out a hand.\\n\"Won\\'t you both sit down?\" asked Sir James. He drew forward two\\nchairs.\\n\"Sir James,\" said Tuppence, plunging boldly, \"I dare say you will\\nthink it is most awful cheek of me coming here like this.\\nBecause, of course, it\\'s nothing whatever to do with you, and\\nthen you\\'re a very important person, and of course Tommy and I\\nare very unimportant.\" She paused for breath.\\n\"Tommy?\" queried Sir James, looking across at the American.\\n\"No, that\\'s Julius,\" explained Tuppence. \"I\\'m rather nervous,\\nand that makes me tell it badly. What I really want to know is\\nwhat you meant by what you said to me the other day? Did you mean\\nto warn me against Mrs. Vandemeyer? You did, didn\\'t you?\"\\n\"My dear young lady, as far as I recollect I only mentioned that\\nthere were equally good situations to be obtained elsewhere.\"\\n\"Yes, I know. But it was a hint, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\"Well, perhaps it was,\" admitted Sir James gravely.\\n\"Well, I want to know more. I want to know just WHY you gave me\\na hint.\"\\nSir James smiled at her earnestness.\\n\"Suppose the lady brings a libel action against me for defamation\\nof character?\"\\n\"Of course,\" said Tuppence. \"I know lawyers are always\\ndreadfully careful. But can\\'t we say \\'without prejudice\\' first,\\nand then say just what we want to.\"\\n\"Well,\" said Sir James, still smiling, \"without prejudice, then,\\nif I had a young sister forced to earn her living, I should not\\nlike to see her in Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s service. I felt it incumbent\\non me just to give you a hint. It is no place for a young and\\ninexperienced girl. That is all I can tell you.\"\\n\"I see,\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. \"Thank you very much. But\\nI\\'m not REALLY inexperienced, you know. I knew perfectly that\\nshe was a bad lot when I went there--as a matter of fact that\\'s\\nWHY I went----\" She broke off, seeing some bewilderment on the\\nlawyer\\'s face, and went on: \"I think perhaps I\\'d better tell you\\nthe whole story, Sir James. I\\'ve a sort of feeling that you\\'d\\nknow in a minute if I didn\\'t tell the truth, and so you might as\\nwell know all about it from the beginning. What do you think,\\nJulius?\"\\n\"As you\\'re bent on it, I\\'d go right ahead with the facts,\"\\nreplied the American, who had so far sat in silence.\\n\"Yes, tell me all about it,\" said Sir James. \"I want to know who\\nTommy is.\"\\nThus encouraged Tuppence plunged into her tale, and the lawyer\\nlistened with close attention.\\n\"Very interesting,\" he said, when she finished. \"A great deal of\\nwhat you tell me, child, is already known to me. I\\'ve had\\ncertain theories of my own about this Jane Finn. You\\'ve done\\nextraordinarily well so far, but it\\'s rather too bad of--what do\\nyou know him as?--Mr. Carter to pitchfork you two young things\\ninto an affair of this kind. By the way, where did Mr.\\nHersheimmer come in originally? You didn\\'t make that clear?\"\\nJulius answered for himself.\\n\"I\\'m Jane\\'s first cousin,\" he explained, returning the lawyer\\'s\\nkeen gaze.\\n\"Ah!\"\\n\"Oh, Sir James,\" broke out Tuppence, \"what do you think has\\nbecome of Tommy?\"\\n\"H\\'m.\" The lawyer rose, and paced slowly up and down. \"When you\\narrived, young lady, I was just packing up my traps. Going to\\nScotland by the night train for a few days\\' fishing. But there\\nare different kinds of fishing. I\\'ve a good mind to stay, and\\nsee if we can\\'t get on the track of that young chap.\"\\n\"Oh!\" Tuppence clasped her hands ecstatically.\\n\"All the same, as I said before, it\\'s too bad of--of Carter to\\nset you two babies on a job like this. Now, don\\'t get offended,\\nMiss--er----\"\\n\"Cowley. Prudence Cowley. But my friends call me Tuppence.\"\\n\"Well, Miss Tuppence, then, as I\\'m certainly going to be a\\nfriend. Don\\'t be offended because I think you\\'re young. Youth is\\na failing only too easily outgrown. Now, about this young Tommy\\nof yours----\"\\n\"Yes.\" Tuppence clasped her hands.\\n\"Frankly, things look bad for him. He\\'s been butting in\\nsomewhere where he wasn\\'t wanted. Not a doubt of it. But don\\'t\\ngive up hope.\"\\n\"And you really will help us? There, Julius! He didn\\'t want me\\nto come,\" she added by way of explanation.\\n\"H\\'m,\" said the lawyer, favouring Julius with another keen\\nglance. \"And why was that?\"\\n\"I reckoned it would be no good worrying you with a petty little\\nbusiness like this.\"\\n\"I see.\" He paused a moment. \"This petty little business, as\\nyou call it, bears directly on a very big business, bigger\\nperhaps than either you or Miss Tuppence know. If this boy is\\nalive, he may have very valuable information to give us.\\nTherefore, we must find him.\"\\n\"Yes, but how?\" cried Tuppence. \"I\\'ve tried to think of\\neverything.\"\\nSir James smiled.\\n\"And yet there\\'s one person quite near at hand who in all\\nprobability knows where he is, or at all events where he is\\nlikely to be.\"\\n\"Who is that?\" asked Tuppence, puzzled.\\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer.\"\\n\"Yes, but she\\'d never tell us.\"\\n\"Ah, that is where I come in. I think it quite likely that I\\nshall be able to make Mrs. Vandemeyer tell me what I want to\\nknow.\"\\n\"How?\" demanded Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide.\\n\"Oh, just by asking her questions,\" replied Sir James easily.\\n\"That\\'s the way we do it, you know.\"\\nHe tapped with his finger on the table, and Tuppence felt again\\nthe intense power that radiated from the man.\\n\"And if she won\\'t tell?\" asked Julius suddenly.\\n\"I think she will. I have one or two powerful levers. Still, in\\nthat unlikely event, there is always the possibility of bribery.\"\\n\"Sure. And that\\'s where I come in!\" cried Julius, bringing his\\nfist down on the table with a bang. \"You can count on me, if\\nnecessary, for one million dollars. Yes, sir, one million\\ndollars!\"\\nSir James sat down and subjected Julius to a long scrutiny.\\n\"Mr. Hersheimmer,\" he said at last, \"that is a very large sum.\"\\n\"I guess it\\'ll have to be. These aren\\'t the kind of folk to\\noffer sixpence to.\"\\n\"At the present rate of exchange it amounts to considerably over\\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand pounds.\"\\n\"That\\'s so. Maybe you think I\\'m talking through my hat, but I\\ncan deliver the goods all right, with enough over to spare for\\nyour fee.\"\\nSir James flushed slightly.\\n\"There is no question of a fee, Mr. Hersheimmer. I am not a\\nprivate detective.\"\\n\"Sorry. I guess I was just a mite hasty, but I\\'ve been feeling\\nbad about this money question. I wanted to offer a big reward\\nfor news of Jane some days ago, but your crusted institution of\\nScotland Yard advised me against it. Said it was undesirable.\"\\n\"They were probably right,\" said Sir James dryly.\\n\"But it\\'s all O.K. about Julius,\" put in Tuppence. \"He\\'s not\\npulling your leg. He\\'s got simply pots of money.\"\\n\"The old man piled it up in style,\" explained Julius. \"Now,\\nlet\\'s get down to it. What\\'s your idea?\"\\nSir James considered for a moment or two.\\n\"There is no time to be lost. The sooner we strike the better.\"\\nHe turned to Tuppence. \"Is Mrs. Vandemeyer dining out to-night,\\ndo you know?\"\\n\"Yes, I think so, but she will not be out late. Otherwise, she\\nwould have taken the latchkey.\"\\n\"Good. I will call upon her about ten o\\'clock. What time are you\\nsupposed to return?\"\\n\"About nine-thirty or ten, but I could go back earlier.\"\\n\"You must not do that on any account. It might arouse suspicion\\nif you did not stay out till the usual time. Be back by\\nnine-thirty. I will arrive at ten. Mr. Hersheimmer will wait\\nbelow in a taxi perhaps.\"\\n\"He\\'s got a new Rolls-Royce car,\" said Tuppence with vicarious\\npride.\\n\"Even better. If I succeed in obtaining the address from her, we\\ncan go there at once, taking Mrs. Vandemeyer with us if\\nnecessary. You understand?\"\\n\"Yes.\" Tuppence rose to her feet with a skip of delight. \"Oh, I\\nfeel so much better!\"\\n\"Don\\'t build on it too much, Miss Tuppence. Go easy.\"\\nJulius turned to the lawyer.\\n\"Say, then. I\\'ll call for you in the car round about\\nnine-thirty. Is that right?\"\\n\"Perhaps that will be the best plan. It would be unnecessary to\\nhave two cars waiting about. Now, Miss Tuppence, my advice to\\nyou is to go and have a good dinner, a REALLY good one, mind. And\\ndon\\'t think ahead more than you can help.\"\\nHe shook hands with them both, and a moment later they were\\noutside.\\n\"Isn\\'t he a duck?\" inquired Tuppence ecstatically, as she skipped\\ndown the steps. \"Oh, Julius, isn\\'t he just a duck?\"\\n\"Well, I allow he seems to be the goods all right. And I was\\nwrong about its being useless to go to him. Say, shall we go\\nright away back to the Ritz?\"\\n\"I must walk a bit, I think. I feel so excited. Drop me in the\\npark, will you? Unless you\\'d like to come too?\"\\n\"I want to get some petrol,\" he explained. \"And send off a cable\\nor two.\"\\n\"All right. I\\'ll meet you at the Ritz at seven. We\\'ll have to\\ndine upstairs. I can\\'t show myself in these glad rags.\"\\n\"Sure. I\\'ll get Felix help me choose the menu. He\\'s some head\\nwaiter, that. So long.\"\\nTuppence walked briskly along towards the Serpentine, first\\nglancing at her watch. It was nearly six o\\'clock. She remembered\\nthat she had had no tea, but felt too excited to be conscious of\\nhunger. She walked as far as Kensington Gardens and then slowly\\nretraced her steps, feeling infinitely better for the fresh air\\nand exercise. It was not so easy to follow Sir James\\'s advice,\\nand put the possible events of the evening out of her head. As\\nshe drew nearer and nearer to Hyde Park corner, the temptation to\\nreturn to South Audley Mansions was almost irresistible.\\nAt any rate, she decided, it would do no harm just to go and LOOK\\nat the building. Perhaps, then, she could resign herself to\\nwaiting patiently for ten o\\'clock.\\nSouth Audley Mansions looked exactly the same as usual. What\\nTuppence had expected she hardly knew, but the sight of its red\\nbrick stolidity slightly assuaged the growing and entirely\\nunreasonable uneasiness that possessed her. She was just turning\\naway when she heard a piercing whistle, and the faithful Albert\\ncame running from the building to join her.\\nTuppence frowned. It was no part of the programme to have\\nattention called to her presence in the neighbourhood, but Albert\\nwas purple with suppressed excitement.\\n\"I say, miss, she\\'s a-going!\"\\n\"Who\\'s going?\" demanded Tuppence sharply.\\n\"The crook. Ready Rita. Mrs. Vandemeyer. She\\'s a-packing up,\\nand she\\'s just sent down word for me to get her a taxi.\"\\n\"What?\" Tuppence clutched his arm.\\n\"It\\'s the truth, miss. I thought maybe as you didn\\'t know about\\nit.\"\\n\"Albert,\" cried Tuppence, \"you\\'re a brick. If it hadn\\'t been for\\nyou we\\'d have lost her.\"\\nAlbert flushed with pleasure at this tribute.\\n\"There\\'s no time to lose,\" said Tuppence, crossing the road.\\n\"I\\'ve got to stop her. At all costs I must keep her here\\nuntil----\" She broke off. \"Albert, there\\'s a telephone here,\\nisn\\'t there?\"\\nThe boy shook his head.\\n\"The flats mostly have their own, miss. But there\\'s a box just\\nround the corner.\"\\n\"Go to it then, at once, and ring up the Ritz Hotel. Ask for Mr.\\nHersheimmer, and when you get him tell him to get Sir James and\\ncome on at once, as Mrs. Vandemeyer is trying to hook it. If you\\ncan\\'t get him, ring up Sir James Peel Edgerton, you\\'ll find his\\nnumber in the book, and tell him what\\'s happening. You won\\'t\\nforget the names, will you?\"\\nAlbert repeated them glibly. \"You trust to me, miss, it\\'ll be\\nall right. But what about you? Aren\\'t you afraid to trust\\nyourself with her?\"\\n\"No, no, that\\'s all right. BUT GO AND TELEPHONE. Be quick.\"\\nDrawing a long breath, Tuppence entered the Mansions and ran up\\nto the door of No. 20. How she was to detain Mrs. Vandemeyer\\nuntil the two men arrived, she did not know, but somehow or other\\nit had to be done, and she must accomplish the task\\nsingle-handed. What had occasioned this precipitate departure?\\nDid Mrs. Vandemeyer suspect her?\\nSpeculations were idle. Tuppence pressed the bell firmly. She\\nmight learn something from the cook.\\nNothing happened and, after waiting some minutes, Tuppence\\npressed the bell again, keeping her finger on the button for some\\nlittle while. At last she heard footsteps inside, and a moment\\nlater Mrs. Vandemeyer herself opened the door. She lifted her\\neyebrows at the sight of the girl.\\n\"You?\"\\n\"I had a touch of toothache, ma\\'am,\" said Tuppence glibly. \"So\\nthought it better to come home and have a quiet evening.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer said nothing, but she drew back and let Tuppence\\npass into the hall.\\n\"How unfortunate for you,\" she said coldly. \"You had better go\\nto bed.\"\\n\"Oh, I shall be all right in the kitchen, ma\\'am. Cook will----\"\\n\"Cook is out,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer, in a rather disagreeable\\ntone. \"I sent her out. So you see you had better go to bed.\"\\nSuddenly Tuppence felt afraid. There was a ring in Mrs.\\nVandemeyer\\'s voice that she did not like at all. Also, the other\\nwoman was slowly edging her up the passage. Tuppence turned at\\nbay.\\n\"I don\\'t want----\"\\nThen, in a flash, a rim of cold steel touched her temple, and\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s voice rose cold and menacing:\\n\"You damned little fool! Do you think I don\\'t know? No, don\\'t\\nanswer. If you struggle or cry out, I\\'ll shoot you like a dog.\"\\nThe rim of steel pressed a little harder against the girl\\'s\\ntemple.\\n\"Now then, march,\" went on Mrs. Vandemeyer. \"This way--into my\\nroom. In a minute, when I\\'ve done with you, you\\'ll go to bed as I\\ntold you to. And you\\'ll sleep--oh yes, my little spy, you\\'ll\\nsleep all right!\"\\nThere was a sort of hideous geniality in the last words which\\nTuppence did not at all like. For the moment there was nothing\\nto be done, and she walked obediently into Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s\\nbedroom. The pistol never left her forehead. The room was in a\\nstate of wild disorder, clothes were flung about right and left,\\na suit-case and a hat box, half-packed, stood in the middle of\\nthe floor.\\nTuppence pulled herself together with an effort. Her voice shook\\na little, but she spoke out bravely.\\n\"Come now,\" she said. \"This is nonsense. You can\\'t shoot me.\\nWhy, every one in the building would hear the report.\"\\n\"I\\'d risk that,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer cheerfully. \"But, as long\\nas you don\\'t sing out for help, you\\'re all right--and I don\\'t\\nthink you will. You\\'re a clever girl. You deceived ME all right.\\nI hadn\\'t a suspicion of you! So I\\'ve no doubt that you understand\\nperfectly well that this is where I\\'m on top and you\\'re\\nunderneath. Now then--sit on the bed. Put your hands above your\\nhead, and if you value your life don\\'t move them.\"\\nTuppence obeyed passively. Her good sense told her that there\\nwas nothing else to do but accept the situation. If she shrieked\\nfor help there was very little chance of anyone hearing her,\\nwhereas there was probably quite a good chance of Mrs.\\nVandemeyer\\'s shooting her. In the meantime, every minute of delay\\ngained was valuable.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer laid down the revolver on the edge of the\\nwashstand within reach of her hand, and, still eyeing Tuppence\\nlike a lynx in case the girl should attempt to move, she took a\\nlittle stoppered bottle from its place on the marble and poured\\nsome of its contents into a glass which she filled up with water.\\n\"What\\'s that?\" asked Tuppence sharply.\\n\"Something to make you sleep soundly.\"\\nTuppence paled a little.\\n\"Are you going to poison me?\" she asked in a whisper.\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer, smiling agreeably.\\n\"Then I shan\\'t drink it,\" said Tuppence firmly. \"I\\'d much rather\\nbe shot. At any rate that would make a row, and some one might\\nhear it. But I won\\'t be killed off quietly like a lamb.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer stamped her foot.\\n\"Don\\'t be a little fool! Do you really think I want a hue and\\ncry for murder out after me? If you\\'ve any sense at all, you\\'ll\\nrealize that poisoning you wouldn\\'t suit my book at all. It\\'s a\\nsleeping draught, that\\'s all. You\\'ll wake up to-morrow morning\\nnone the worse. I simply don\\'t want the bother of tying you up\\nand gagging you. That\\'s the alternative--and you won\\'t like it, I\\ncan tell you! I can be very rough if I choose. So drink this\\ndown like a good girl, and you\\'ll be none the worse for it.\"\\nIn her heart of hearts Tuppence believed her. The arguments she\\nhad adduced rang true. It was a simple and effective method of\\ngetting her out of the way for the time being. Nevertheless, the\\ngirl did not take kindly to the idea of being tamely put to sleep\\nwithout as much as one bid for freedom. She felt that once Mrs.\\nVandemeyer gave them the slip, the last hope of finding Tommy\\nwould be gone.\\nTuppence was quick in her mental processes. All these\\nreflections passed through her mind in a flash, and she saw where\\na chance, a very problematical chance, lay, and she determined to\\nrisk all in one supreme effort.\\nAccordingly, she lurched suddenly off the bed and fell on her\\nknees before Mrs. Vandemeyer, clutching her skirts frantically.\\n\"I don\\'t believe it,\" she moaned. \"It\\'s poison--I know it\\'s\\npoison. Oh, don\\'t make me drink it\"--her voice rose to a\\nshriek--\"don\\'t make me drink it!\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer, glass in hand, looked down with a curling lip at\\nthis sudden collapse.\\n\"Get up, you little idiot! Don\\'t go on drivelling there. How you\\never had the nerve to play your part as you did I can\\'t think.\"\\nShe stamped her foot. \"Get up, I say.\"\\nBut Tuppence continued to cling and sob, interjecting her sobs\\nwith incoherent appeals for mercy. Every minute gained was to\\nthe good. Moreover, as she grovelled, she moved imperceptibly\\nnearer to her objective.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer gave a sharp impatient exclamation, and jerked\\nthe girl to her knees.\\n\"Drink it at once!\" Imperiously she pressed the glass to the\\ngirl\\'s lips.\\nTuppence gave one last despairing moan.\\n\"You swear it won\\'t hurt me?\" she temporized.\\n\"Of course it won\\'t hurt you. Don\\'t be a fool.\"\\n\"Will you swear it?\"\\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the other impatiently. \"I swear it.\"\\nTuppence raised a trembling left hand to the glass.\\n\"Very well.\" Her mouth opened meekly.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer gave a sigh of relief, off her guard for the\\nmoment. Then, quick as a flash, Tuppence jerked the glass upward\\nas hard as she could. The fluid in it splashed into Mrs.\\nVandemeyer\\'s face, and during her momentary gasp, Tuppence\\'s\\nright hand shot out and grasped the revolver where it lay on the\\nedge of the washstand. The next moment she had sprung back a\\npace, and the revolver pointed straight at Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s\\nheart, with no unsteadiness in the hand that held it.\\nIn the moment of victory, Tuppence betrayed a somewhat\\nunsportsmanlike triumph.\\n\"Now who\\'s on top and who\\'s underneath?\" she crowed.\\nThe other\\'s face was convulsed with rage. For a minute Tuppence\\nthought she was going to spring upon her, which would have placed\\nthe girl in an unpleasant dilemma, since she meant to draw the\\nline at actually letting off the revolver. However, with an\\neffort Mrs. Vandemeyer controlled herself, and at last a slow\\nevil smile crept over her face.\\n\"Not a fool, then, after all! You did that well, girl. But you\\nshall pay for it--oh, yes, you shall pay for it! I have a long\\nmemory!\"\\n\"I\\'m surprised you should have been gulfed so easily,\" said\\nTuppence scornfully. \"Did you really think I was the kind of\\ngirl to roll about on the floor and whine for mercy?\"\\n\"You may do--some day!\" said the other significantly.\\nThe cold malignity of her manner sent an unpleasant chill down\\nTuppence\\'s spine, but she was not going to give in to it.\\n\"Supposing we sit down,\" she said pleasantly. \"Our present\\nattitude is a little melodramatic. No--not on the bed. Draw a\\nchair up to the table, that\\'s right. Now I\\'ll sit opposite you\\nwith the revolver in front of me--just in case of accidents.\\nSplendid. Now, let\\'s talk.\"\\n\"What about?\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer sullenly.\\nTuppence eyed her thoughtfully for a minute. She was remembering\\nseveral things. Boris\\'s words, \"I believe you would sell--us!\"\\nand her answer, \"The price would have to be enormous,\" given\\nlightly, it was true, yet might not there be a substratum of\\ntruth in it? Long ago, had not Whittington asked: \"Who\\'s been\\nblabbing? Rita?\" Would Rita Vandemeyer prove to be the weak\\nspot in the armour of Mr. Brown?\\nKeeping her eyes fixed steadily on the other\\'s face, Tuppence\\nreplied quietly:\\n\"Money----\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer started. Clearly, the reply was unexpected.\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\"I\\'ll tell you. You said just now that you had a long memory. A\\nlong memory isn\\'t half as useful as a long purse! I dare say it\\nrelieves your feelings a good deal to plan out all sorts of\\ndreadful things to do to me, but is that PRACTICAL? Revenge is\\nvery unsatisfactory. Every one always says so. But\\nmoney\"--Tuppence warmed to her pet creed--\"well, there\\'s nothing\\nunsatisfactory about money, is there?\"\\n\"Do you think,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer scornfully, \"that I am the\\nkind of woman to sell my friends?\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence promptly. \"If the price was big enough.\"\\n\"A paltry hundred pounds or so!\"\\n\"No,\" said Tuppence. \"I should suggest--a hundred thousand!\"\\nHer economical spirit did not permit her to mention the whole\\nmillion dollars suggested by Julius.\\nA flush crept over Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s face.\\n\"What did you say?\" she asked, her fingers playing nervously with\\na brooch on her breast. In that moment Tuppence knew that the\\nfish was hooked, and for the first time she felt a horror of her\\nown money-loving spirit. It gave her a dreadful sense of kinship\\nto the woman fronting her.\\n\"A hundred thousand pounds,\" repeated Tuppence.\\nThe light died out of Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s eyes. She leaned back in\\nher chair.\\n\"Bah!\" she said. \"You haven\\'t got it.\"\\n\"No,\" admitted Tuppence, \"I haven\\'t--but I know some one who\\nhas.\"\\n\"Who?\"\\n\"A friend of mine.\"\\n\"Must be a millionaire,\" remarked Mrs. Vandemeyer unbelievingly.\\n\"As a matter of fact he is. He\\'s an American. He\\'ll pay you\\nthat without a murmur. You can take it from me that it\\'s a\\nperfectly genuine proposition.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer sat up again.\\n\"I\\'m inclined to believe you,\" she said slowly.\\nThere was silence between them for some time, then Mrs.\\nVandemeyer looked up.\\n\"What does he want to know, this friend of yours?\"\\nTuppence went through a momentary struggle, but it was Julius\\'s\\nmoney, and his interests must come first.\\n\"He wants to know where Jane Finn is,\" she said boldly.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer showed no surprise.\\n\"I\\'m not sure where she is at the present moment,\" she replied.\\n\"But you could find out?\"\\n\"Oh, yes,\" returned Mrs. Vandemeyer carelessly. \"There would be\\nno difficulty about that.\"\\n\"Then\"--Tuppence\\'s voice shook a little--\"there\\'s a boy, a friend\\nof mine. I\\'m afraid something\\'s happened to him, through your pal\\nBoris.\"\\n\"What\\'s his name?\"\\n\"Tommy Beresford.\"\\n\"Never heard of him. But I\\'ll ask Boris. He\\'ll tell me anything\\nhe knows.\"\\n\"Thank you.\" Tuppence felt a terrific rise in her spirits. It\\nimpelled her to more audacious efforts. \"There\\'s one thing\\nmore.\"\\n\"Well?\"\\nTuppence leaned forward and lowered her voice.\\n\"WHO IS MR. BROWN?\"\\nHer quick eyes saw the sudden paling of the beautiful face. With\\nan effort Mrs. Vandemeyer pulled herself together and tried to\\nresume her former manner. But the attempt was a mere parody.\\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\\n\"You can\\'t have learnt much about us if you don\\'t know that\\nNOBODY KNOWS WHO MR. BROWN IS....\"\\n\"You do,\" said Tuppence quietly.\\nAgain the colour deserted the other\\'s face.\\n\"What makes you think that?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said the girl truthfully. \"But I\\'m sure.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer stared in front of her for a long time.\\n\"Yes,\" she said hoarsely, at last, \"I know. I was beautiful, you\\nsee--very beautiful--\"\\n\"You are still,\" said Tuppence with admiration.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer shook her head. There was a strange gleam in her\\nelectric-blue eyes.\\n\"Not beautiful enough,\" she said in a soft dangerous voice.\\n\"Not--beautiful--enough! And sometimes, lately, I\\'ve been\\nafraid.... It\\'s dangerous to know too much!\" She leaned forward\\nacross the table. \"Swear that my name shan\\'t be brought into\\nit--that no one shall ever know.\"\\n\"I swear it. And, once\\'s he caught, you\\'ll be out of danger.\"\\nA terrified look swept across Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s face.\\n\"Shall I? Shall I ever be?\" She clutched Tuppence\\'s arm.\\n\"You\\'re sure about the money?\"\\n\"Quite sure.\"\\n\"When shall I have it? There must be no delay.\"\\n\"This friend of mine will be here presently. He may have to send\\ncables, or something like that. But there won\\'t be any\\ndelay--he\\'s a terrific hustler.\"\\nA resolute look settled on Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s face.\\n\"I\\'ll do it. It\\'s a great sum of money, and besides\"--she gave a\\ncurious smile--\"it is not--wise to throw over a woman like me!\"\\nFor a moment or two, she remained smiling, and lightly tapping\\nher fingers on the table. Suddenly she started, and her face\\nblanched.\\n\"What was that?\"\\n\"I heard nothing.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer gazed round her fearfully.\\n\"If there should be some one listening----\"\\n\"Nonsense. Who could there be?\"\\n\"Even the walls might have ears,\" whispered the other. \"I tell\\nyou I\\'m frightened. You don\\'t know him!\"\\n\"Think of the hundred thousand pounds,\" said Tuppence soothingly.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer passed her tongue over her dried lips.\\n\"You don\\'t know him,\" she reiterated hoarsely. \"He\\'s--ah!\"\\nWith a shriek of terror she sprang to her feet. Her outstretched\\nhand pointed over Tuppence\\'s head. Then she swayed to the ground\\nin a dead faint.\\nTuppence looked round to see what had startled her.\\nIn the doorway were Sir James Peel Edgerton and Julius\\nHersheimmer.\\nCHAPTER XIII\\nTHE VIGIL\\nSIR James brushed past Julius and hurriedly bent over the fallen\\nwoman.\\n\"Heart,\" he said sharply. \"Seeing us so suddenly must have given\\nher a shock. Brandy--and quickly, or she\\'ll slip through our\\nfingers.\"\\nJulius hurried to the washstand.\\n\"Not there,\" said Tuppence over her shoulder. \"In the tantalus\\nin the dining-room. Second door down the passage.\"\\nBetween them Sir James and Tuppence lifted Mrs. Vandemeyer and\\ncarried her to the bed. There they dashed water on her face, but\\nwith no result. The lawyer fingered her pulse.\\n\"Touch and go,\" he muttered. \"I wish that young fellow would\\nhurry up with the brandy.\"\\nAt that moment Julius re-entered the room, carrying a glass half\\nfull of the spirit which he handed to Sir James. While Tuppence\\nlifted her head the lawyer tried to force a little of the spirit\\nbetween her closed lips. Finally the woman opened her eyes\\nfeebly. Tuppence held the glass to her lips.\\n\"Drink this.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer complied. The brandy brought the colour back to\\nher white cheeks, and revived her in a marvellous fashion. She\\ntried to sit up--then fell back with a groan, her hand to her\\nside.\\n\"It\\'s my heart,\" she whispered. \"I mustn\\'t talk.\"\\nShe lay back with closed eyes.\\nSir James kept his finger on her wrist a minute longer, then\\nwithdrew it with a nod.\\n\"She\\'ll do now.\"\\nAll three moved away, and stood together talking in low voices.\\nOne and all were conscious of a certain feeling of anticlimax.\\nClearly any scheme for cross-questioning the lady was out of the\\nquestion for the moment. For the time being they were baffled,\\nand could do nothing.\\nTuppence related how Mrs. Vandemeyer had declared herself willing\\nto disclose the identity of Mr. Brown, and how she had consented\\nto discover and reveal to them the whereabouts of Jane Finn.\\nJulius was congratulatory.\\n\"That\\'s all right, Miss Tuppence. Splendid! I guess that\\nhundred thousand pounds will look just as good in the morning to\\nthe lady as it did over night. There\\'s nothing to worry over.\\nShe won\\'t speak without the cash anyway, you bet!\"\\nThere was certainly a good deal of common sense in this, and\\nTuppence felt a little comforted.\\n\"What you say is true,\" said Sir James meditatively. \"I must\\nconfess, however, that I cannot help wishing we had not\\ninterrupted at the minute we did. Still, it cannot be helped, it\\nis only a matter of waiting until the morning.\"\\nHe looked across at the inert figure on the bed. Mrs. Vandemeyer\\nlay perfectly passive with closed eyes. He shook his head.\\n\"Well,\" said Tuppence, with an attempt at cheerfulness, \"we must\\nwait until the morning, that\\'s all. But I don\\'t think we ought\\nto leave the flat.\"\\n\"What about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard?\"\\n\"Albert? And suppose she came round again and hooked it. Albert\\ncouldn\\'t stop her.\"\\n\"I guess she won\\'t want to make tracks away from the dollars.\"\\n\"She might. She seemed very frightened of \\'Mr. Brown.\\' \"\\n\"What? Real plumb scared of him?\"\\n\"Yes. She looked round and said even walls had ears.\"\\n\"Maybe she meant a dictaphone,\" said Julius with interest.\\n\"Miss Tuppence is right,\" said Sir James quietly. \"We must not\\nleave the flat--if only for Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s sake.\"\\nJulius stared at him.\\n\"You think he\\'d get after her? Between now and to-morrow\\nmorning. How could he know, even?\"\\n\"You forget your own suggestion of a dictaphone,\" said Sir James\\ndryly. \"We have a very formidable adversary. I believe, if we\\nexercise all due care, that there is a very good chance of his\\nbeing delivered into our hands. But we must neglect no\\nprecaution. We have an important witness, but she must be\\nsafeguarded. I would suggest that Miss Tuppence should go to\\nbed, and that you and I, Mr. Hersheimmer, should share the\\nvigil.\"\\nTuppence was about to protest, but happening to glance at the bed\\nshe saw Mrs. Vandemeyer, her eyes half-open, with such an\\nexpression of mingled fear and malevolence on her face that it\\nquite froze the words on her lips.\\nFor a moment she wondered whether the faint and the heart attack\\nhad been a gigantic sham, but remembering the deadly pallor she\\ncould hardly credit the supposition. As she looked the expression\\ndisappeared as by magic, and Mrs. Vandemeyer lay inert and\\nmotionless as before. For a moment the girl fancied she must have\\ndreamt it. But she determined nevertheless to be on the alert.\\n\"Well,\" said Julius, \"I guess we\\'d better make a move out of here\\nany way.\"\\nThe others fell in with his suggestion. Sir James again felt\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s pulse.\\n\"Perfectly satisfactory,\" he said in a low voice to Tuppence.\\n\"She\\'ll be absolutely all right after a night\\'s rest.\"\\nThe girl hesitated a moment by the bed. The intensity of the\\nexpression she had surprised had impressed her powerfully. Mrs.\\nVandemeyer lifted her lids. She seemed to be struggling to\\nspeak. Tuppence bent over her.\\n\"Don\\'t--leave----\" she seemed unable to proceed, murmuring\\nsomething that sounded like \"sleepy.\" Then she tried again.\\nTuppence bent lower still. It was only a breath.\\n\"Mr.--Brown----\" The voice stopped.\\nBut the half-closed eyes seemed still to send an agonized\\nmessage.\\nMoved by a sudden impulse, the girl said quickly:\\n\"I shan\\'t leave the flat. I shall sit up all night.\"\\nA flash of relief showed before the lids descended once more.\\nApparently Mrs. Vandemeyer slept. But her words had awakened a\\nnew uneasiness in Tuppence. What had she meant by that low\\nmurmur: \"Mr. Brown?\" Tuppence caught herself nervously looking\\nover her shoulder. The big wardrobe loomed up in a sinister\\nfashion before her eyes. Plenty of room for a man to hide in\\nthat.... Half-ashamed of herself, Tuppence pulled it open and\\nlooked inside. No one--of course! She stooped down and looked\\nunder the bed. There was no other possible hiding-place.\\nTuppence gave her familiar shake of the shoulders. It was\\nabsurd, this giving way to nerves! Slowly she went out of the\\nroom. Julius and Sir James were talking in a low voice. Sir James\\nturned to her.\\n\"Lock the door on the outside, please, Miss Tuppence, and take\\nout the key. There must be no chance of anyone entering that\\nroom.\"\\nThe gravity of his manner impressed them, and Tuppence felt less\\nashamed of her attack of \"nerves.\"\\n\"Say,\" remarked Julius suddenly, \"there\\'s Tuppence\\'s bright boy.\\nI guess I\\'d better go down and ease his young mind. That\\'s some\\nlad, Tuppence.\"\\n\"How did you get in, by the way?\" asked Tuppence suddenly. \"I\\nforgot to ask.\"\\n\"Well, Albert got me on the phone all right. I ran round for Sir\\nJames here, and we came right on. The boy was on the look out\\nfor us, and was just a mite worried about what might have\\nhappened to you. He\\'d been listening outside the door of the\\nflat, but couldn\\'t hear anything. Anyhow he suggested sending us\\nup in the coal lift instead of ringing the bell. And sure enough\\nwe landed in the scullery and came right along to find you.\\nAlbert\\'s still below, and must be just hopping mad by this time.\"\\nWith which Julius departed abruptly.\\n\"Now then, Miss Tuppence,\" said Sir James, \"you know this place\\nbetter than I do. Where do you suggest we should take up our\\nquarters?\"\\nTuppence considered for a moment or two.\\n\"I think Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s boudoir would be the most\\ncomfortable,\" she said at last, and led the way there.\\nSir James looked round approvingly.\\n\"This will do very well, and now, my dear young lady, do go to\\nbed and get some sleep.\"\\nTuppence shook her head resolutely.\\n\"I couldn\\'t, thank you, Sir James. I should dream of Mr. Brown\\nall night!\"\\n\"But you\\'ll be so tired, child.\"\\n\"No, I shan\\'t. I\\'d rather stay up--really.\"\\nThe lawyer gave in.\\nJulius reappeared some minutes later, having reassured Albert and\\nrewarded him lavishly for his services. Having in his turn failed\\nto persuade Tuppence to go to bed, he said decisively:\\n\"At any rate, you\\'ve got to have something to eat right away.\\nWhere\\'s the larder?\"\\nTuppence directed him, and he returned in a few minutes with a\\ncold pie and three plates.\\nAfter a hearty meal, the girl felt inclined to pooh-pooh her\\nfancies of half an hour before. The power of the money bribe\\ncould not fail.\\n\"And now, Miss Tuppence,\" said Sir James, \"we want to hear your\\nadventures.\"\\n\"That\\'s so,\" agreed Julius.\\nTuppence narrated her adventures with some complacence. Julius\\noccasionally interjected an admiring \"Bully.\" Sir James said\\nnothing until she had finished, when his quiet \"well done, Miss\\nTuppence,\" made her flush with pleasure.\\n\"There\\'s one thing I don\\'t get clearly,\" said Julius. \"What put\\nher up to clearing out?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" confessed Tuppence.\\nSir James stroked his chin thoughtfully.\\n\"The room was in great disorder. That looks as though her flight\\nwas unpremeditated. Almost as though she got a sudden warning to\\ngo from some one.\"\\n\"Mr. Brown, I suppose,\" said Julius scoffingly.\\nThe lawyer looked at him deliberately for a minute or two.\\n\"Why not?\" he said. \"Remember, you yourself have once been\\nworsted by him.\"\\nJulius flushed with vexation.\\n\"I feel just mad when I think of how I handed out Jane\\'s\\nphotograph to him like a lamb. Gee, if I ever lay hands on it\\nagain, I\\'ll freeze on to it like--like hell!\"\\n\"That contingency is likely to be a remote one,\" said the other\\ndryly.\\n\"I guess you\\'re right,\" said Julius frankly. \"And, in any case,\\nit\\'s the original I\\'m out after. Where do you think she can be,\\nSir James?\"\\nThe lawyer shook his head.\\n\"Impossible to say. But I\\'ve a very good idea where she has\\nbeen.\"\\n\"You have? Where?\"\\nSir James smiled.\\n\"At the scene of your nocturnal adventures, the Bournemouth\\nnursing home.\"\\n\"There? Impossible. I asked.\"\\n\"No, my dear sir, you asked if anyone of the name of Jane Finn\\nhad been there. Now, if the girl had been placed there it would\\nalmost certainly be under an assumed name.\"\\n\"Bully for you,\" cried Julius. \"I never thought of that!\"\\n\"It was fairly obvious,\" said the other.\\n\"Perhaps the doctor\\'s in it too,\" suggested Tuppence.\\nJulius shook his head.\\n\"I don\\'t think so. I took to him at once. No, I\\'m pretty sure\\nDr. Hall\\'s all right.\"\\n\"Hall, did you say?\" asked Sir James. \"That is curious--really\\nvery curious.\"\\n\"Why?\" demanded Tuppence.\\n\"Because I happened to meet him this morning. I\\'ve known him\\nslightly on and off for some years, and this morning I ran across\\nhim in the street. Staying at the Metropole, he told me.\" He\\nturned to Julius. \"Didn\\'t he tell you he was coming up to town?\"\\nJulius shook his head.\\n\"Curious,\" mused Sir James. \"You did not mention his name this\\nafternoon, or I would have suggested your going to him for\\nfurther information with my card as introduction.\"\\n\"I guess I\\'m a mutt,\" said Julius with unusual humility. \"I ought\\nto have thought of the false name stunt.\"\\n\"How could you think of anything after falling out of that tree?\"\\ncried Tuppence. \"I\\'m sure anyone else would have been killed\\nright off.\"\\n\"Well, I guess it doesn\\'t matter now, anyway,\" said Julius.\\n\"We\\'ve got Mrs. Vandemeyer on a string, and that\\'s all we need.\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence, but there was a lack of assurance in her\\nvoice.\\nA silence settled down over the party. Little by little the\\nmagic of the night began to gain a hold on them. There were\\nsudden creaks of the furniture, imperceptible rustlings in the\\ncurtains. Suddenly Tuppence sprang up with a cry.\\n\"I can\\'t help it. I know Mr. Brown\\'s somewhere in the flat! I\\ncan FEEL him.\"\\n\"Sure, Tuppence, how could he be? This door\\'s open into the\\nhall. No one could have come in by the front door without our\\nseeing and hearing him.\"\\n\"I can\\'t help it. I FEEL he\\'s here!\"\\nShe looked appealingly at Sir James, who replied gravely:\\n\"With due deference to your feelings, Miss Tuppence (and mine as\\nwell for that matter), I do not see how it is humanly possible\\nfor anyone to be in the flat without our knowledge.\"\\nThe girl was a little comforted by his wards.\\n\"Sitting up at night is always rather jumpy,\" she confessed.\\n\"Yes,\" said Sir James. \"We are in the condition of people\\nholding a seance. Perhaps if a medium were present we might get\\nsome marvellous results.\"\\n\"Do you believe in spiritualism?\" asked Tuppence, opening her\\neyes wide.\\nThe lawyer shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"There is some truth in it, without a doubt. But most of the\\ntestimony would not pass muster in the witness-box.\"\\nThe hours drew on. With the first faint glimmerings of dawn, Sir\\nJames drew aside the curtains. They beheld, what few Londoners\\nsee, the slow rising of the sun over the sleeping city. Somehow,\\nwith the coming of the light, the dreads and fancies of the past\\nnight seemed absurd. Tuppence\\'s spirits revived to the normal.\\n\"Hooray!\" she said. \"It\\'s going to be a gorgeous day. And we\\nshall find Tommy. And Jane Finn. And everything will be lovely.\\nI shall ask Mr. Carter if I can\\'t be made a Dame!\"\\nAt seven o\\'clock Tuppence volunteered to go and make some tea.\\nShe returned with a tray, containing the teapot and four cups.\\n\"Who\\'s the other cup for?\" inquired Julius.\\n\"The prisoner, of course. I suppose we might call her that?\"\\n\"Taking her tea seems a kind of anticlimax to last night,\" said\\nJulius thoughtfully.\\n\"Yes, it does,\" admitted Tuppence. \"But, anyway, here goes.\\nPerhaps you\\'d both come, too, in case she springs on me, or\\nanything. You see, we don\\'t know what mood she\\'ll wake up in.\"\\nSir James and Julius accompanied her to the door.\\n\"Where\\'s the key? Oh, of course, I\\'ve got it myself.\"\\nShe put it in the lock, and turned it, then paused.\\n\"Supposing, after all, she\\'s escaped?\" she murmured in a whisper.\\n\"Plumb impossible,\" replied Julius reassuringly.\\nBut Sir James said nothing.\\nTuppence drew a long breath and entered. She heaved a sigh of\\nrelief as she saw that Mrs. Vandemeyer was lying on the bed.\\n\"Good morning,\" she remarked cheerfully. \"I\\'ve brought you some\\ntea.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer did not reply. Tuppence put down the cup on the\\ntable by the bed and went across to draw up the blinds. When she\\nturned, Mrs. Vandemeyer still lay without a movement. With a\\nsudden fear clutching at her heart, Tuppence ran to the bed. The\\nhand she lifted was cold as ice.... Mrs. Vandemeyer would never\\nspeak now....\\nHer cry brought the others. A very few minutes sufficed. Mrs.\\nVandemeyer was dead--must have been dead some hours. She had\\nevidently died in her sleep.\\n\"If that isn\\'t the cruellest luck,\" cried Julius in despair.\\nThe lawyer was calmer, but there was a curious gleam in his eyes.\\n\"If it is luck,\" he replied.\\n\"You don\\'t think--but, say, that\\'s plumb impossible--no one could\\nhave got in.\"\\n\"No,\" admitted the lawyer. \"I don\\'t see how they could. And\\nyet--she is on the point of betraying Mr. Brown, and--she dies.\\nIs it only chance?\"\\n\"But how----\"\\n\"Yes, HOW! That is what we must find out.\" He stood there\\nsilently, gently stroking his chin. \"We must find out,\" he said\\nquietly, and Tuppence felt that if she was Mr. Brown she would\\nnot like the tone of those simple words.\\nJulius\\'s glance went to the window.\\n\"The window\\'s open,\" he remarked. \"Do you think----\"\\nTuppence shook her head.\\n\"The balcony only goes along as far as the boudoir. We were\\nthere.\"\\n\"He might have slipped out----\" suggested Julius.\\nBut Sir James interrupted him.\\n\"Mr. Brown\\'s methods are not so crude. In the meantime we must\\nsend for a doctor, but before we do so, is there anything in this\\nroom that might be of value to us?\"\\nHastily, the three searched. A charred mass in the grate\\nindicated that Mrs. Vandemeyer had been burning papers on the eve\\nof her flight. Nothing of importance remained, though they\\nsearched the other rooms as well.\\n\"There\\'s that,\" said Tuppence suddenly, pointing to a small,\\nold-fashioned safe let into the wall. \"It\\'s for jewellery, I\\nbelieve, but there might be something else in it.\"\\nThe key was in the lock, and Julius swung open the door, and\\nsearched inside. He was some time over the task.\\n\"Well,\" said Tuppence impatiently.\\nThere was a pause before Julius answered, then he withdrew his\\nhead and shut to the door.\\n\"Nothing,\" he said.\\nIn five minutes a brisk young doctor arrived, hastily summoned.\\nHe was deferential to Sir James, whom he recognized.\\n\"Heart failure, or possibly an overdose of some\\nsleeping-draught.\" He sniffed. \"Rather an odour of chloral in\\nthe air.\"\\nTuppence remembered the glass she had upset. A new thought drove\\nher to the washstand. She found the little bottle from which\\nMrs. Vandemeyer had poured a few drops.\\nIt had been three parts full. Now--IT WAS EMPTY.\\nCHAPTER XIV\\nA CONSULTATION\\nNOTHING was more surprising and bewildering to Tuppence than the\\nease and simplicity with which everything was arranged, owing to\\nSir James\\'s skilful handling. The doctor accepted quite readily\\nthe theory that Mrs. Vandemeyer had accidentally taken an\\noverdose of chloral. He doubted whether an inquest would be\\nnecessary. If so, he would let Sir James know. He understood\\nthat Mrs. Vandemeyer was on the eve of departure for abroad, and\\nthat the servants had already left? Sir James and his young\\nfriends had been paying a call upon her, when she was suddenly\\nstricken down and they had spent the night in the flat, not\\nliking to leave her alone. Did they know of any relatives? They\\ndid not, but Sir James referred him to Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s\\nsolicitor.\\nShortly afterwards a nurse arrived to take charge, and the other\\nleft the ill-omened building.\\n\"And what now?\" asked Julius, with a gesture of despair. \"I guess\\nwe\\'re down and out for good.\"\\nSir James stroked his chin thoughtfully.\\n\"No,\" he said quietly. \"There is still the chance that Dr. Hall\\nmay be able to tell us something.\"\\n\"Gee! I\\'d forgotten him.\"\\n\"The chance is slight, but it must not be neglected. I think I\\ntold you that he is staying at the Metropole. I should suggest\\nthat we call upon him there as soon as possible. Shall we say\\nafter a bath and breakfast?\"\\nIt was arranged that Tuppence and Julius should return to the\\nRitz, and call for Sir James in the car. This programme was\\nfaithfully carried out, and a little after eleven they drew up\\nbefore the Metropole. They asked for Dr. Hall, and a page-boy\\nwent in search of him. In a few minutes the little doctor came\\nhurrying towards them.\\n\"Can you spare us a few minutes, Dr. Hall?\" said Sir James\\npleasantly. \"Let me introduce you to Miss Cowley. Mr.\\nHersheimmer, I think, you already know.\"\\nA quizzical gleam came into the doctor\\'s eye as he shook hands\\nwith Julius.\\n\"Ah, yes, my young friend of the tree episode! Ankle all right,\\neh?\"\\n\"I guess it\\'s cured owing to your skilful treatment, doc.\"\\n\"And the heart trouble? Ha ha!\"\\n\"Still searching,\" said Julius briefly.\\n\"To come to the point, can we have a word with you in private?\"\\nasked Sir James.\\n\"Certainly. I think there is a room here where we shall be quite\\nundisturbed.\"\\nHe led the way, and the others followed him. They sat down, and\\nthe doctor looked inquiringly at Sir James.\\n\"Dr. Hall, I am very anxious to find a certain young lady for the\\npurpose of obtaining a statement from her. I have reason to\\nbelieve that she has been at one time or another in your\\nestablishment at Bournemouth. I hope I am transgressing no\\nprofessional etiquette in questioning you on the subject?\"\\n\"I suppose it is a matter of testimony?\"\\nSir James hesitated a moment, then he replied:\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"I shall be pleased to give you any information in my power. What\\nis the young lady\\'s name? Mr. Hersheimmer asked me, I\\nremember----\" He half turned to Julius.\\n\"The name,\" said Sir James bluntly, \"is really immaterial. She\\nwould be almost certainly sent to you under an assumed one. But I\\nshould like to know if you are acquainted with a Mrs.\\nVandemeyer?\"\\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer, of 20 South Audley Mansions? I know her\\nslightly.\"\\n\"You are not aware of what has happened?\"\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\"You do not know that Mrs. Vandemeyer is dead?\"\\n\"Dear, dear, I had no idea of it! When did it happen?\"\\n\"She took an overdose of chloral last night.\"\\n\"Purposely?\"\\n\"Accidentally, it is believed. I should not like to say myself.\\nAnyway, she was found dead this morning.\"\\n\"Very sad. A singularly handsome woman. I presume she was a\\nfriend of yours, since you are acquainted with all these\\ndetails.\"\\n\"I am acquainted with the details because--well, it was I who\\nfound her dead.\"\\n\"Indeed,\" said the doctor, starting.\\n\"Yes,\" said Sir James, and stroked his chin reflectively.\\n\"This is very sad news, but you will excuse me if I say that I do\\nnot see how it bears on the subject of your inquiry?\"\\n\"It bears on it in this way, is it not a fact that Mrs.\\nVandemeyer committed a young relative of hers to your charge?\"\\nJulius leaned forward eagerly.\\n\"That is the case,\" said the doctor quietly.\\n\"Under the name of----?\"\\n\"Janet Vandemeyer. I understood her to be a niece of Mrs.\\nVandemeyer\\'s.\"\\n\"And she came to you?\"\\n\"As far as I can remember in June or July of 1915.\"\\n\"Was she a mental case?\"\\n\"She is perfectly sane, if that is what you mean. I understood\\nfrom Mrs. Vandemeyer that the girl had been with her on the\\nLusitania when that ill-fated ship was sunk, and had suffered a\\nsevere shock in consequence.\"\\n\"We\\'re on the right track, I think?\" Sir James looked round.\\n\"As I said before, I\\'m a mutt!\" returned Julius.\\nThe doctor looked at them all curiously.\\n\"You spoke of wanting a statement from her,\" he said. \"Supposing\\nshe is not able to give one?\"\\n\"What? You have just said that she is perfectly sane.\"\\n\"So she is. Nevertheless, if you want a statement from her\\nconcerning any events prior to May 7, 1915, she will not be able\\nto give it to you.\"\\nThey looked at the little man, stupefied. He nodded cheerfully.\\n\"It\\'s a pity,\" he said. \"A great pity, especially as I gather,\\nSir James, that the matter is important. But there it is, she\\ncan tell you nothing.\"\\n\"But why, man? Darn it all, why?\"\\nThe little man shifted his benevolent glance to the excited young\\nAmerican.\\n\"Because Janet Vandemeyer is suffering from a complete loss of\\nmemory.\"\\n\"WHAT?\"\\n\"Quite so. An interesting case, a very interesting case. Not so\\nuncommon, really, as you would think. There are several very\\nwell known parallels. It\\'s the first case of the kind that I\\'ve\\nhad under my own personal observation, and I must admit that I\\'ve\\nfound it of absorbing interest.\" There was something rather\\nghoulish in the little man\\'s satisfaction.\\n\"And she remembers nothing,\" said Sir James slowly.\\n\"Nothing prior to May 7, 1915. After that date her memory is as\\ngood as yours or mine.\"\\n\"Then the first thing she remembers?\"\\n\"Is landing with the survivors. Everything before that is a\\nblank. She did not know her own name, or where she had come from,\\nor where she was. She couldn\\'t even speak her own tongue.\"\\n\"But surely all this is most unusual?\" put in Julius.\\n\"No, my dear sir. Quite normal under the circumstances. Severe\\nshock to the nervous system. Loss of memory proceeds nearly\\nalways on the same lines. I suggested a specialist, of course.\\nThere\\'s a very good man in Paris--makes a study of these\\ncases--but Mrs. Vandemeyer opposed the idea of publicity that\\nmight result from such a course.\"\\n\"I can imagine she would,\" said Sir James grimly.\\n\"I fell in with her views. There is a certain notoriety given to\\nthese cases. And the girl was very young--nineteen, I believe.\\nIt seemed a pity that her infirmity should be talked about--might\\ndamage her prospects. Besides, there is no special treatment to\\npursue in such cases. It is really a matter of waiting.\"\\n\"Waiting?\"\\n\"Yes, sooner or later, the memory will return--as suddenly as it\\nwent. But in all probability the girl will have entirely\\nforgotten the intervening period, and will take up life where she\\nleft off--at the sinking of the Lusitania.\"\\n\"And when do you expect this to happen?\"\\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"Ah, that I cannot say. Sometimes it is a matter of months,\\nsometimes it has been known to be as long as twenty years!\\nSometimes another shock does the trick. One restores what the\\nother took away.\"\\n\"Another shock, eh?\" said Julius thoughtfully.\\n\"Exactly. There was a case in Colorado----\" The little man\\'s\\nvoice trailed on, voluble, mildly enthusiastic.\\nJulius did not seem to be listening. He had relapsed into his\\nown thoughts and was frowning. Suddenly he came out of his brown\\nstudy, and hit the table such a resounding bang with his fist\\nthat every one jumped, the doctor most of all.\\n\"I\\'ve got it! I guess, doc, I\\'d like your medical opinion on the\\nplan I\\'m about to outline. Say Jane was to cross the herring\\npond again, and the same thing was to happen. The submarine, the\\nsinking ship, every one to take to the boats--and so on.\\nWouldn\\'t that do the trick? Wouldn\\'t it give a mighty big bump to\\nher subconscious self, or whatever the jargon is, and start it\\nfunctioning again right away?\"\\n\"A very interesting speculation, Mr. Hersheimmer. In my own\\nopinion, it would be successful. It is unfortunate that there is\\nno chance of the conditions repeating themselves as you suggest.\"\\n\"Not by nature, perhaps, doc. But I\\'m talking about art.\"\\n\"Art?\"\\n\"Why, yes. What\\'s the difficulty? Hire a liner----\"\\n\"A liner!\" murmured Dr. Hall faintly.\\n\"Hire some passengers, hire a submarine--that\\'s the only\\ndifficulty, I guess. Governments are apt to be a bit hidebound\\nover their engines of war. They won\\'t sell to the firstcomer.\\nStill, I guess that can be got over. Ever heard of the word\\n\\'graft,\\' sir? Well, graft gets there every time! I reckon that\\nwe shan\\'t really need to fire a torpedo. If every one hustles\\nround and screams loud enough that the ship is sinking, it ought\\nto be enough for an innocent young girl like Jane. By the time\\nshe\\'s got a life-belt on her, and is being hustled into a boat,\\nwith a well-drilled lot of artistes doing the hysterical stunt on\\ndeck, why--she ought to be right back where she was in May, 1915.\\nHow\\'s that for the bare outline?\"\\nDr. Hall looked at Julius. Everything that he was for the moment\\nincapable of saying was eloquent in that look.\\n\"No,\" said Julius, in answer to it, \"I\\'m not crazy. The thing\\'s\\nperfectly possible. It\\'s done every day in the States for the\\nmovies. Haven\\'t you seen trains in collision on the screen?\\nWhat\\'s the difference between buying up a train and buying up a\\nliner? Get the properties and you can go right ahead!\"\\nDr. Hall found his voice.\\n\"But the expense, my dear sir.\" His voice rose. \"The expense!\\nIt will be COLOSSAL!\"\\n\"Money doesn\\'t worry me any,\" explained Julius simply.\\nDr. Hall turned an appealing face to Sir James, who smiled\\nslightly.\\n\"Mr. Hersheimmer is very well off--very well off indeed.\"\\nThe doctor\\'s glance came back to Julius with a new and subtle\\nquality in it. This was no longer an eccentric young fellow with\\na habit of falling off trees. The doctor\\'s eyes held the\\ndeference accorded to a really rich man.\\n\"Very remarkable plan. Very remarkable,\" he murmured. \"The\\nmovies--of course! Your American word for the kinema. Very\\ninteresting. I fear we are perhaps a little behind the times over\\nhere in our methods. And you really mean to carry out this\\nremarkable plan of yours.\"\\n\"You bet your bottom dollar I do.\"\\nThe doctor believed him--which was a tribute to his nationality.\\nIf an Englishman had suggested such a thing, he would have had\\ngrave doubts as to his sanity.\\n\"I cannot guarantee a cure,\" he pointed out. \"Perhaps I ought to\\nmake that quite clear.\"\\n\"Sure, that\\'s all right,\" said Julius. \"You just trot out Jane,\\nand leave the rest to me.\"\\n\"Jane?\"\\n\"Miss Janet Vandemeyer, then. Can we get on the long distance to\\nyour place right away, and ask them to send her up; or shall I\\nrun down and fetch her in my car?\"\\nThe doctor stared.\\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Hersheimmer. I thought you understood.\"\\n\"Understood what?\"\\n\"That Miss Vandemeyer is no longer under my care.\"\\nCHAPTER XV\\nTUPPENCE RECEIVES A PROPOSAL\\nJULIUS sprang up.\\n\"What?\"\\n\"I thought you were aware of that.\"\\n\"When did she leave?\"\\n\"Let me see. To-day is Monday, is it not? It must have been\\nlast Wednesday--why, surely--yes, it was the same evening that\\nyou--er--fell out of my tree.\"\\n\"That evening? Before, or after?\"\\n\"Let me see--oh yes, afterwards. A very urgent message arrived\\nfrom Mrs. Vandemeyer. The young lady and the nurse who was in\\ncharge of her left by the night train.\"\\nJulius sank back again into his chair.\\n\"Nurse Edith--left with a patient--I remember,\" he muttered. \"My\\nGod, to have been so near!\"\\nDr. Hall looked bewildered.\\n\"I don\\'t understand. Is the young lady not with her aunt, after\\nall?\"\\nTuppence shook her head. She was about to speak when a warning\\nglance from Sir James made her hold her tongue. The lawyer rose.\\n\"I\\'m much obliged to you, Hall. We\\'re very grateful for all\\nyou\\'ve told us. I\\'m afraid we\\'re now in the position of having to\\ntrack Miss Vandemeyer anew. What about the nurse who accompanied\\nher; I suppose you don\\'t know where she is?\"\\nThe doctor shook his head.\\n\"We\\'ve not heard from her, as it happens. I understood she was\\nto remain with Miss Vandemeyer for a while. But what can have\\nhappened? Surely the girl has not been kidnapped.\"\\n\"That remains to be seen,\" said Sir James gravely.\\nThe other hesitated.\\n\"You do not think I ought to go to the police?\"\\n\"No, no. In all probability the young lady is with other\\nrelations.\"\\nThe doctor was not completely satisfied, but he saw that Sir\\nJames was determined to say no more, and realized that to try and\\nextract more information from the famous K.C. would be mere waste\\nof labour. Accordingly, he wished them goodbye, and they left the\\nhotel. For a few minutes they stood by the car talking.\\n\"How maddening,\" cried Tuppence. \"To think that Julius must have\\nbeen actually under the same roof with her for a few hours.\"\\n\"I was a darned idiot,\" muttered Julius gloomily.\\n\"You couldn\\'t know,\" Tuppence consoled him. \"Could he?\" She\\nappealed to Sir James.\\n\"I should advise you not to worry,\" said the latter kindly. \"No\\nuse crying over spilt milk, you know.\"\\n\"The great thing is what to do next,\" added Tuppence the\\npractical.\\nSir James shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"You might advertise for the nurse who accompanied the girl. That\\nis the only course I can suggest, and I must confess I do not\\nhope for much result. Otherwise there is nothing to be done.\"\\n\"Nothing?\" said Tuppence blankly. \"And--Tommy?\"\\n\"We must hope for the best,\" said Sir James. \"Oh yes, we must go\\non hoping.\"\\nBut over her downcast head his eyes met Julius\\'s, and almost\\nimperceptibly he shook his head. Julius understood. The lawyer\\nconsidered the case hopeless. The young American\\'s face grew\\ngrave. Sir James took Tuppence\\'s hand.\\n\"You must let me know if anything further comes to light. Letters\\nwill always be forwarded.\"\\nTuppence stared at him blankly.\\n\"You are going away?\"\\n\"I told you. Don\\'t you remember? To Scotland.\"\\n\"Yes, but I thought----\" The girl hesitated.\\nSir James shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"My dear young lady, I can do nothing more, I fear. Our clues\\nhave all ended in thin air. You can take my word for it that\\nthere is nothing more to be done. If anything should arise, I\\nshall be glad to advise you in any way I can.\"\\nHis words gave Tuppence an extraordinarily desolate feeling.\\n\"I suppose you\\'re right,\" she said. \"Anyway, thank you very much\\nfor trying to help us. Good-bye.\"\\nJulius was bending over the car. A momentary pity came into Sir\\nJames\\'s keen eyes, as he gazed into the girl\\'s downcast face.\\n\"Don\\'t be too disconsolate, Miss Tuppence,\" he said in a low\\nvoice. \"Remember, holiday-time isn\\'t always all playtime. One\\nsometimes manages to put in some work as well.\"\\nSomething in his tone made Tuppence glance up sharply. He shook\\nhis head with a smile.\\n\"No, I shan\\'t say any more. Great mistake to say too much.\\nRemember that. Never tell all you know--not even to the person\\nyou know best. Understand? Good-bye.\"\\nHe strode away. Tuppence stared after him. She was beginning to\\nunderstand Sir James\\'s methods. Once before he had thrown her a\\nhint in the same careless fashion. Was this a hint? What exactly\\nlay behind those last brief words? Did he mean that, after all,\\nhe had not abandoned the case; that, secretly, he would be\\nworking on it still while----\\nHer meditations were interrupted by Julius, who adjured her to\\n\"get right in.\"\\n\"You\\'re looking kind of thoughtful,\" he remarked as they started\\noff. \"Did the old guy say anything more?\"\\nTuppence opened her mouth impulsively, and then shut it again.\\nSir James\\'s words sounded in her ears: \"Never tell all you\\nknow--not even to the person you know best.\" And like a flash\\nthere came into her mind another memory. Julius before the safe\\nin the flat, her own question and the pause before his reply,\\n\"Nothing.\" Was there really nothing? Or had he found something\\nhe wished to keep to himself? If he could make a reservation, so\\ncould she.\\n\"Nothing particular,\" she replied.\\nShe felt rather than saw Julius throw a sideways glance at her.\\n\"Say, shall we go for a spin in the park?\"\\n\"If you like.\"\\nFor a while they ran on under the trees in silence. It was a\\nbeautiful day. The keen rush through the air brought a new\\nexhilaration to Tuppence.\\n\"Say, Miss Tuppence, do you think I\\'m ever going to find Jane?\"\\nJulius spoke in a discouraged voice. The mood was so alien to\\nhim that Tuppence turned and stared at him in surprise. He\\nnodded.\\n\"That\\'s so. I\\'m getting down and out over the business. Sir\\nJames to-day hadn\\'t got any hope at all, I could see that. I\\ndon\\'t like him--we don\\'t gee together somehow--but he\\'s pretty\\ncute, and I guess he wouldn\\'t quit if there was any chance of\\nsuccess--now, would he?\"\\nTuppence felt rather uncomfortable, but clinging to her belief\\nthat Julius also had withheld something from her, she remained\\nfirm.\\n\"He suggested advertising for the nurse,\" she reminded him.\\n\"Yes, with a \\'forlorn hope\\' flavour to his voice! No--I\\'m about\\nfed up. I\\'ve half a mind to go back to the States right away.\"\\n\"Oh no!\" cried Tuppence. \"We\\'ve got to find Tommy.\"\\n\"I sure forgot Beresford,\" said Julius contritely. \"That\\'s so.\\nWe must find him. But after--well, I\\'ve been day-dreaming ever\\nsince I started on this trip--and these dreams are rotten poor\\nbusiness. I\\'m quit of them. Say, Miss Tuppence, there\\'s\\nsomething I\\'d like to ask you.\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"You and Beresford. What about it?\"\\n\"I don\\'t understand you,\" replied Tuppence with dignity, adding\\nrather inconsequently: \"And, anyway, you\\'re wrong!\"\\n\"Not got a sort of kindly feeling for one another?\"\\n\"Certainly not,\" said Tuppence with warmth. \"Tommy and I are\\nfriends--nothing more.\"\\n\"I guess every pair of lovers has said that sometime or another,\"\\nobserved Julius.\\n\"Nonsense!\" snapped Tuppence. \"Do I look the sort of girl that\\'s\\nalways falling in love with every man she meets?\"\\n\"You do not. You look the sort of girl that\\'s mighty often\\ngetting fallen in love with!\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence, rather taken aback. \"That\\'s a compliment, I\\nsuppose?\"\\n\"Sure. Now let\\'s get down to this. Supposing we never find\\nBeresford and--and----\"\\n\"All right--say it! I can face facts. Supposing he\\'s--dead!\\nWell?\"\\n\"And all this business fiddles out. What are you going to do?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Tuppence forlornly.\\n\"You\\'ll be darned lonesome, you poor kid.\"\\n\"I shall be all right,\" snapped Tuppence with her usual\\nresentment of any kind of pity.\\n\"What about marriage?\" inquired Julius. \"Got any views on the\\nsubject?\"\\n\"I intend to marry, of course,\" replied Tuppence. \"That is,\\nif\"--she paused, knew a momentary longing to draw back, and then\\nstuck to her guns bravely--\"I can find some one rich enough to\\nmake it worth my while. That\\'s frank, isn\\'t it? I dare say you\\ndespise me for it.\"\\n\"I never despise business instinct,\" said Julius. \"What\\nparticular figure have you in mind?\"\\n\"Figure?\" asked Tuppence, puzzled. \"Do you mean tall or short?\"\\n\"No. Sum--income.\"\\n\"Oh, I--I haven\\'t quite worked that out.\"\\n\"What about me?\"\\n\"You?\"\\n\"Sure thing.\"\\n\"Oh, I couldn\\'t!\"\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\"I tell you I couldn\\'t.\"\\n\"Again, why not?\"\\n\"It would seem so unfair.\"\\n\"I don\\'t see anything unfair about it. I call your bluff, that\\'s\\nall. I admire you immensely, Miss Tuppence, more than any girl\\nI\\'ve ever met. You\\'re so darned plucky. I\\'d just love to give\\nyou a real, rattling good time. Say the word, and we\\'ll run\\nround right away to some high-class jeweller, and fix up the ring\\nbusiness.\"\\n\"I can\\'t,\" gasped Tuppence.\\n\"Because of Beresford?\"\\n\"No, no, NO!\"\\n\"Well then?\"\\nTuppence merely continued to shake her head violently.\\n\"You can\\'t reasonably expect more dollars than I\\'ve got.\"\\n\"Oh, it isn\\'t that,\" gasped Tuppence with an almost hysterical\\nlaugh. \"But thanking you very much, and all that, I think I\\'d\\nbetter say no.\"\\n\"I\\'d be obliged if you\\'d do me the favour to think it over until\\nto-morrow.\"\\n\"It\\'s no use.\"\\n\"Still, I guess we\\'ll leave it like that.\"\\n\"Very well,\" said Tuppence meekly.\\nNeither of them spoke again until they reached the Ritz.\\nTuppence went upstairs to her room. She felt morally battered to\\nthe ground after her conflict with Julius\\'s vigorous personality.\\nSitting down in front of the glass, she stared at her own\\nreflection for some minutes.\\n\"Fool,\" murmured Tuppence at length, making a grimace. \"Little\\nfool. Everything you want--everything you\\'ve ever hoped for, and\\nyou go and bleat out \\'no\\' like an idiotic little sheep. It\\'s your\\none chance. Why don\\'t you take it? Grab it? Snatch at it? What\\nmore do you want?\"\\nAs if in answer to her own question, her eyes fell on a small\\nsnapshot of Tommy that stood on her dressing-table in a shabby\\nframe. For a moment she struggled for self-control, and then\\nabandoning all presence, she held it to her lips and burst into a\\nfit of sobbing.\\n\"Oh, Tommy, Tommy,\" she cried, \"I do love you so--and I may never\\nsee you again....\"\\nAt the end of five minutes Tuppence sat up, blew her nose, and\\npushed back her hair.\\n\"That\\'s that,\" she observed sternly. \"Let\\'s look facts in the\\nface. I seem to have fallen in love--with an idiot of a boy who\\nprobably doesn\\'t care two straws about me.\" Here she paused.\\n\"Anyway,\" she resumed, as though arguing with an unseen opponent,\\n\"I don\\'t KNOW that he does. He\\'d never have dared to say so.\\nI\\'ve always jumped on sentiment--and here I am being more\\nsentimental than anybody. What idiots girls are! I\\'ve always\\nthought so. I suppose I shall sleep with his photograph under my\\npillow, and dream about him all night. It\\'s dreadful to feel\\nyou\\'ve been false to your principles.\"\\nTuppence shook her head sadly, as she reviewed her backsliding.\\n\"I don\\'t know what to say to Julius, I\\'m sure. Oh, what a fool I\\nfeel! I\\'ll have to say SOMETHING--he\\'s so American and thorough,\\nhe\\'ll insist upon having a reason. I wonder if he did find\\nanything in that safe----\"\\nTuppence\\'s meditations went off on another tack. She reviewed\\nthe events of last night carefully and persistently. Somehow,\\nthey seemed bound up with Sir James\\'s enigmatical words....\\nSuddenly she gave a great start--the colour faded out of her\\nface. Her eyes, fascinated, gazed in front of her, the pupils\\ndilated.\\n\"Impossible,\" she murmured. \"Impossible! I must be going mad\\neven to think of such a thing....\"\\nMonstrous--yet it explained everything....\\nAfter a moment\\'s reflection she sat down and wrote a note,\\nweighing each word as she did so. Finally she nodded her head as\\nthough satisfied, and slipped it into an envelope which she\\naddressed to Julius. She went down the passage to his\\nsitting-room and knocked at the door. As she had expected, the\\nroom was empty. She left the note on the table.\\nA small page-boy was waiting outside her own door when she\\nreturned to it.\\n\"Telegram for you, miss.\"\\nTuppence took it from the salver, and tore it open carelessly.\\nThen she gave a cry. The telegram was from Tommy!\\nCHAPTER XVI\\nFURTHER ADVENTURES OF TOMMY\\nFROM a darkness punctuated with throbbing stabs of fire, Tommy\\ndragged his senses slowly back to life. When he at last opened\\nhis eyes, he was conscious of nothing but an excruciating pain\\nthrough his temples. He was vaguely aware of unfamiliar\\nsurroundings. Where was he? What had happened? He blinked\\nfeebly. This was not his bedroom at the Ritz. And what the\\ndevil was the matter with his head?\\n\"Damn!\" said Tommy, and tried to sit up. He had remembered. He\\nwas in that sinister house in Soho. He uttered a groan and fell\\nback. Through his almost-closed lids he reconnoitred carefully.\\n\"He is coming to,\" remarked a voice very near Tommy\\'s ear. He\\nrecognized it at once for that of the bearded and efficient\\nGerman, and lay artistically inert. He felt that it would be a\\npity to come round too soon; and until the pain in his head\\nbecame a little less acute, he felt quite incapable of collecting\\nhis wits. Painfully he tried to puzzle out what had happened.\\nObviously somebody must have crept up behind him as he listened\\nand struck him down with a blow on the head. They knew him now\\nfor a spy, and would in all probability give him short shrift.\\nUndoubtedly he was in a tight place. Nobody knew where he was,\\ntherefore he need expect no outside assistance, and must depend\\nsolely on his own wits.\\n\"Well, here goes,\" murmured Tommy to himself, and repeated his\\nformer remark.\\n\"Damn!\" he observed, and this time succeeded in sitting up.\\nIn a minute the German stepped forward and placed a glass to his\\nlips, with the brief command \"Drink.\" Tommy obeyed. The potency\\nof the draught made him choke, but it cleared his brain in a\\nmarvellous manner.\\nHe was lying on a couch in the room in which the meeting had been\\nheld. On one side of him was the German, on the other the\\nvillainous-faced doorkeeper who had let him in. The others were\\ngrouped together at a little distance away. But Tommy missed one\\nface. The man known as Number One was no longer of the company.\\n\"Feel better?\" asked the German, as he removed the empty glass.\\n\"Yes, thanks,\" returned Tommy cheerfully.\\n\"Ah, my young friend, it is lucky for you your skull is so thick.\\nThe good Conrad struck hard.\" He indicated the evil-faced\\ndoorkeeper by a nod. The man grinned.\\nTommy twisted his head round with an effort.\\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"so you\\'re Conrad, are you? It strikes me the\\nthickness of my skull was lucky for you too. When I look at you I\\nfeel it\\'s almost a pity I\\'ve enabled you to cheat the hangman.\"\\nThe man snarled, and the bearded man said quietly:\\n\"He would have run no risk of that.\"\\n\"Just as you like,\" replied Tommy. \"I know it\\'s the fashion to\\nrun down the police. I rather believe in them myself.\"\\nHis manner was nonchalant to the last degree. Tommy Beresford\\nwas one of those young Englishmen not distinguished by any\\nspecial intellectual ability, but who are emphatically at their\\nbest in what is known as a \"tight place.\" Their natural\\ndiffidence and caution fall from them like a glove. Tommy\\nrealized perfectly that in his own wits lay the only chance of\\nescape, and behind his casual manner he was racking his brains\\nfuriously.\\nThe cold accents of the German took up the conversation:\\n\"Have you anything to say before you are put to death as a spy?\"\\n\"Simply lots of things,\" replied Tommy with the same urbanity as\\nbefore.\\n\"Do you deny that you were listening at that door?\"\\n\"I do not. I must really apologize--but your conversation was so\\ninteresting that it overcame my scruples.\"\\n\"How did you get in?\"\\n\"Dear old Conrad here.\" Tommy smiled deprecatingly at him. \"I\\nhesitate to suggest pensioning off a faithful servant, but you\\nreally ought to have a better watchdog.\"\\nConrad snarled impotently, and said sullenly, as the man with the\\nbeard swung round upon him:\\n\"He gave the word. How was I to know?\"\\n\"Yes,\" Tommy chimed in. \"How was he to know? Don\\'t blame the\\npoor fellow. His hasty action has given me the pleasure of seeing\\nyou all face to face.\"\\nHe fancied that his words caused some discomposure among the\\ngroup, but the watchful German stilled it with a wave of his\\nhand.\\n\"Dead men tell no tales,\" he said evenly.\\n\"Ah,\" said Tommy, \"but I\\'m not dead yet!\"\\n\"You soon will be, my young friend,\" said the German.\\nAn assenting murmur came from the others.\\nTommy\\'s heart beat faster, but his casual pleasantness did not\\nwaver.\\n\"I think not,\" he said firmly. \"I should have a great objection\\nto dying.\"\\nHe had got them puzzled, he saw that by the look on his captor\\'s\\nface.\\n\"Can you give us any reason why we should not put you to death?\"\\nasked the German.\\n\"Several,\" replied Tommy. \"Look here, you\\'ve been asking me a\\nlot of questions. Let me ask you one for a change. Why didn\\'t\\nyou kill me off at once before I regained consciousness?\"\\nThe German hesitated, and Tommy seized his advantage.\\n\"Because you didn\\'t know how much I knew--and where I obtained\\nthat knowledge. If you kill me now, you never will know.\"\\nBut here the emotions of Boris became too much for him. He\\nstepped forward waving his arms.\\n\"You hell-hound of a spy,\" he screamed. \"We will give you short\\nshrift. Kill him! Kill him!\"\\nThere was a roar of applause.\\n\"You hear?\" said the German, his eyes on Tommy. \"What have you\\nto say to that?\"\\n\"Say?\" Tommy shrugged his shoulders. \"Pack of fools. Let them\\nask themselves a few questions. How did I get into this place?\\nRemember what dear old Conrad said--WITH YOUR OWN PASSWORD,\\nwasn\\'t it? How did I get hold of that? You don\\'t suppose I came\\nup those steps haphazard and said the first thing that came into\\nmy head?\"\\nTommy was pleased with the concluding words of this speech. His\\nonly regret was that Tuppence was not present to appreciate its\\nfull flavour.\\n\"That is true,\" said the working man suddenly. \"Comrades, we\\nhave been betrayed!\"\\nAn ugly murmur arose. Tommy smiled at them encouragingly.\\n\"That\\'s better. How can you hope to make a success of any job if\\nyou don\\'t use your brains?\"\\n\"You will tell us who has betrayed us,\" said the German. \"But\\nthat shall not save you--oh, no! You shall tell us all that you\\nknow. Boris, here, knows pretty ways of making people speak!\"\\n\"Bah!\" said Tommy scornfully, fighting down a singularly\\nunpleasant feeling in the pit of his stomach. \"You will neither\\ntorture me nor kill me.\"\\n\"And why not?\" asked Boris.\\n\"Because you\\'d kill the goose that lays the golden eggs,\" replied\\nTommy quietly.\\nThere was a momentary pause. It seemed as though Tommy\\'s\\npersistent assurance was at last conquering. They were no longer\\ncompletely sure of themselves. The man in the shabby clothes\\nstared at Tommy searchingly.\\n\"He\\'s bluffing you, Boris,\" he said quietly.\\nTommy hated him. Had the man seen through him?\\nThe German, with an effort, turned roughly to Tommy.\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\"What do you think I mean?\" parried Tommy, searching desperately\\nin his own mind.\\nSuddenly Boris stepped forward, and shook his fist in Tommy\\'s\\nface.\\n\"Speak, you swine of an Englishman--speak!\"\\n\"Don\\'t get so excited, my good fellow,\" said Tommy calmly.\\n\"That\\'s the worst of you foreigners. You can\\'t keep calm. Now, I\\nask you, do I look as though I thought there were the least\\nchance of your killing me?\"\\nHe looked confidently round, and was glad they could not hear the\\npersistent beating of his heart which gave the lie to his words.\\n\"No,\" admitted Boris at last sullenly, \"you do not.\"\\n\"Thank God, he\\'s not a mind reader,\" thought Tommy. Aloud he\\npursued his advantage:\\n\"And why am I so confident? Because I know something that puts\\nme in a position to propose a bargain.\"\\n\"A bargain?\" The bearded man took him up sharply.\\n\"Yes--a bargain. My life and liberty against----\" He paused.\\n\"Against what?\"\\nThe group pressed forward. You could have heard a pin drop.\\nSlowly Tommy spoke.\\n\"The papers that Danvers brought over from America in the\\nLusitania.\"\\nThe effect of his words was electrical. Every one was on his\\nfeet. The German waved them back. He leaned over Tommy, his face\\npurple with excitement.\\n\"Himmel! You have got them, then?\"\\nWith magnificent calm Tommy shook his head.\\n\"You know where they are?\" persisted the German.\\nAgain Tommy shook his head. \"Not in the least.\"\\n\"Then--then----\" angry and baffled, the words failed him.\\nTommy looked round. He saw anger and bewilderment on every face,\\nbut his calm assurance had done its work--no one doubted but that\\nsomething lay behind his words.\\n\"I don\\'t know where the papers are--but I believe that I can find\\nthem. I have a theory----\"\\n\"Pah!\"\\nTommy raised his hand, and silenced the clamours of disgust.\\n\"I call it a theory--but I\\'m pretty sure of my facts--facts that\\nare known to no one but myself. In any case what do you lose? If\\nI can produce the papers--you give me my life and liberty in\\nexchange. Is it a bargain?\"\\n\"And if we refuse?\" said the German quietly.\\nTommy lay back on the couch.\\n\"The 29th,\" he said thoughtfully, \"is less than a fortnight\\nahead----\"\\nFor a moment the German hesitated. Then he made a sign to\\nConrad.\\n\"Take him into the other room.\"\\nFor five minutes, Tommy sat on the bed in the dingy room next\\ndoor. His heart was beating violently. He had risked all on this\\nthrow. How would they decide? And all the while that this\\nagonized questioning went on within him, he talked flippantly to\\nConrad, enraging the cross-grained doorkeeper to the point of\\nhomicidal mania.\\nAt last the door opened, and the German called imperiously to\\nConrad to return.\\n\"Let\\'s hope the judge hasn\\'t put his black cap on,\" remarked\\nTommy frivolously. \"That\\'s right, Conrad, march me in. The\\nprisoner is at the bar, gentlemen.\"\\nThe German was seated once more behind the table. He motioned to\\nTommy to sit down opposite to him.\\n\"We accept,\" he said harshly, \"on terms. The papers must be\\ndelivered to us before you go free.\"\\n\"Idiot!\" said Tommy amiably. \"How do you think I can look for\\nthem if you keep me tied by the leg here?\"\\n\"What do you expect, then?\"\\n\"I must have liberty to go about the business in my own way.\"\\nThe German laughed.\\n\"Do you think we are little children to let you walk out of here\\nleaving us a pretty story full of promises?\"\\n\"No,\" said Tommy thoughtfully. \"Though infinitely simpler for\\nme, I did not really think you would agree to that plan. Very\\nwell, we must arrange a compromise. How would it be if you\\nattached little Conrad here to my person. He\\'s a faithful fellow,\\nand very ready with the fist.\"\\n\"We prefer,\" said the German coldly, \"that you should remain\\nhere. One of our number will carry out your instructions\\nminutely. If the operations are complicated, he will return to\\nyou with a report and you can instruct him further.\"\\n\"You\\'re tying my hands,\" complained Tommy. \"It\\'s a very delicate\\naffair, and the other fellow will muff it up as likely as not,\\nand then where shall I be? I don\\'t believe one of you has got an\\nounce of tact.\"\\nThe German rapped the table.\\n\"Those are our terms. Otherwise, death!\"\\nTommy leaned back wearily.\\n\"I like your style. Curt, but attractive. So be it, then. But\\none thing is essential, I must see the girl.\"\\n\"What girl?\"\\n\"Jane Finn, of course.\"\\nThe other looked at him curiously for some minutes, then he said\\nslowly, and as though choosing his words with care:\\n\"Do you not know that she can tell you nothing?\"\\nTommy\\'s heart beat a little faster. Would he succeed in coming\\nface to face with the girl he was seeking?\\n\"I shall not ask her to tell me anything,\" he said quietly. \"Not\\nin so many words, that is.\"\\n\"Then why see her?\"\\nTommy paused.\\n\"To watch her face when I ask her one question,\" he replied at\\nlast.\\nAgain there was a look in the German\\'s eyes that Tommy did not\\nquite understand.\\n\"She will not be able to answer your question.\"\\n\"That does not matter. I shall have seen her face when I ask it.\"\\n\"And you think that will tell you anything?\" He gave a short\\ndisagreeable laugh. More than ever, Tommy felt that there was a\\nfactor somewhere that he did not understand. The German looked at\\nhim searchingly. \"I wonder whether, after all, you know as much\\nas we think?\" he said softly.\\nTommy felt his ascendancy less sure than a moment before. His\\nhold had slipped a little. But he was puzzled. What had he said\\nwrong? He spoke out on the impulse of the moment.\\n\"There may be things that you know which I do not. I have not\\npretended to be aware of all the details of your show. But\\nequally I\\'ve got something up my sleeve that you don\\'t know\\nabout. And that\\'s where I mean to score. Danvers was a damned\\nclever fellow----\" He broke off as if he had said too much.\\nBut the German\\'s face had lightened a little.\\n\"Danvers,\" he murmured. \"I see----\" He paused a minute, then\\nwaved to Conrad. \"Take him away. Upstairs--you know.\"\\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Tommy. \"What about the girl?\"\\n\"That may perhaps be arranged.\"\\n\"It must be.\"\\n\"We will see about it. Only one person can decide that.\"\\n\"Who?\" asked Tommy. But he knew the answer.\\n\"Mr. Brown----\"\\n\"Shall I see him?\"\\n\"Perhaps.\"\\n\"Come,\" said Conrad harshly.\\nTommy rose obediently. Outside the door his gaoler motioned to\\nhim to mount the stairs. He himself followed close behind. On\\nthe floor above Conrad opened a door and Tommy passed into a\\nsmall room. Conrad lit a hissing gas burner and went out. Tommy\\nheard the sound of the key being turned in the lock.\\nHe set to work to examine his prison. It was a smaller room than\\nthe one downstairs, and there was something peculiarly airless\\nabout the atmosphere of it. Then he realized that there was no\\nwindow. He walked round it. The walls were filthily dirty, as\\neverywhere else. Four pictures hung crookedly on the wall\\nrepresenting scenes from Faust. Marguerite with her box of\\njewels, the church scene, Siebel and his flowers, and Faust and\\nMephistopheles. The latter brought Tommy\\'s mind back to Mr.\\nBrown again. In this sealed and closed chamber, with its\\nclose-fitting heavy door, he felt cut off from the world, and the\\nsinister power of the arch-criminal seemed more real. Shout as\\nhe would, no one could ever hear him. The place was a living\\ntomb....\\nWith an effort Tommy pulled himself together. He sank on to the\\nbed and gave himself up to reflection. His head ached badly;\\nalso, he was hungry. The silence of the place was dispiriting.\\n\"Anyway,\" said Tommy, trying to cheer himself, \"I shall see the\\nchief--the mysterious Mr. Brown and with a bit of luck in\\nbluffing I shall see the mysterious Jane Finn also. After\\nthat----\"\\nAfter that Tommy was forced to admit the prospect looked dreary.\\nCHAPTER XVII\\nANNETTE\\nTHE troubles of the future, however, soon faded before the\\ntroubles of the present. And of these, the most immediate and\\npressing was that of hunger. Tommy had a healthy and vigorous\\nappetite. The steak and chips partaken of for lunch seemed now to\\nbelong to another decade. He regretfully recognized the fact\\nthat he would not make a success of a hunger strike.\\nHe prowled aimlessly about his prison. Once or twice he\\ndiscarded dignity, and pounded on the door. But nobody answered\\nthe summons.\\n\"Hang it all!\" said Tommy indignantly. \"They can\\'t mean to\\nstarve me to death.\" A new-born fear passed through his mind\\nthat this might, perhaps, be one of those \"pretty ways\" of making\\na prisoner speak, which had been attributed to Boris. But on\\nreflection he dismissed the idea.\\n\"It\\'s that sour faced brute Conrad,\" he decided. \"That\\'s a\\nfellow I shall enjoy getting even with one of these days. This is\\njust a bit of spite on his part. I\\'m certain of it.\"\\nFurther meditations induced in him the feeling that it would be\\nextremely pleasant to bring something down with a whack on\\nConrad\\'s egg-shaped head. Tommy stroked his own head tenderly,\\nand gave himself up to the pleasures of imagination. Finally a\\nbright idea flashed across his brain. Why not convert imagination\\ninto reality? Conrad was undoubtedly the tenant of the house.\\nThe others, with the possible exception of the bearded German,\\nmerely used it as a rendezvous. Therefore, why not wait in\\nambush for Conrad behind the door, and when he entered bring down\\na chair, or one of the decrepit pictures, smartly on to his head.\\nOne would, of course, be careful not to hit too hard. And\\nthen--and then, simply walk out! If he met anyone on the way\\ndown, well----Tommy brightened at the thought of an encounter\\nwith his fists. Such an affair was infinitely more in his line\\nthan the verbal encounter of this afternoon. Intoxicated by his\\nplan, Tommy gently unhooked the picture of the Devil and Faust,\\nand settled himself in position. His hopes were high. The plan\\nseemed to him simple but excellent.\\nTime went on, but Conrad did not appear. Night and day were the\\nsame in this prison room, but Tommy\\'s wrist-watch, which enjoyed\\na certain degree of accuracy, informed him that it was nine\\no\\'clock in the evening. Tommy reflected gloomily that if supper\\ndid not arrive soon it would be a question of waiting for\\nbreakfast. At ten o\\'clock hope deserted him, and he flung\\nhimself on the bed to seek consolation in sleep. In five minutes\\nhis woes were forgotten.\\nThe sound of the key turning in the lock awoke him from his\\nslumbers. Not belonging to the type of hero who is famous for\\nawaking in full possession of his faculties, Tommy merely blinked\\nat the ceiling and wondered vaguely where he was. Then he\\nremembered, and looked at his watch. It was eight o\\'clock.\\n\"It\\'s either early morning tea or breakfast,\" deduced the young\\nman, \"and pray God it\\'s the latter!\"\\nThe door swung open. Too late, Tommy remembered his scheme of\\nobliterating the unprepossessing Conrad. A moment later he was\\nglad that he had, for it was not Conrad who entered, but a girl.\\nShe carried a tray which she set down on the table.\\nIn the feeble light of the gas burner Tommy blinked at her. He\\ndecided at once that she was one of the most beautiful girls he\\nhad ever seen. Her hair was a full rich brown, with sudden glints\\nof gold in it as though there were imprisoned sunbeams struggling\\nin its depths. There was a wild-rose quality about her face. Her\\neyes, set wide apart, were hazel, a golden hazel that again\\nrecalled a memory of sunbeams.\\nA delirious thought shot through Tommy\\'s mind.\\n\"Are you Jane Finn?\" he asked breathlessly.\\nThe girl shook her head wonderingly.\\n\"My name is Annette, monsieur.\"\\nShe spoke in a soft, broken English.\\n\"Oh!\" said Tommy, rather taken aback. \"Francaise?\" he hazarded.\\n\"Oui, monsieur. Monsieur parle francais?\"\\n\"Not for any length of time,\" said Tommy. \"What\\'s that?\\nBreakfast?\"\\nThe girl nodded. Tommy dropped off the bed and came and\\ninspected the contents of the tray. It consisted of a loaf, some\\nmargarine, and a jug of coffee.\\n\"The living is not equal to the Ritz,\" he observed with a sigh.\\n\"But for what we are at last about to receive the Lord has made\\nme truly thankful. Amen.\"\\nHe drew up a chair, and the girl turned away to the door.\\n\"Wait a sec,\" cried Tommy. \"There are lots of things I want to\\nask you, Annette. What are you doing in this house? Don\\'t tell\\nme you\\'re Conrad\\'s niece, or daughter, or anything, because I\\ncan\\'t believe it.\"\\n\"I do the SERVICE, monsieur. I am not related to anybody.\"\\n\"I see,\" said Tommy. \"You know what I asked you just now. Have\\nyou ever heard that name?\"\\n\"I have heard people speak of Jane Finn, I think.\"\\n\"You don\\'t know where she is?\"\\nAnnette shook her head.\\n\"She\\'s not in this house, for instance?\"\\n\"Oh no, monsieur. I must go now--they will be waiting for me.\"\\nShe hurried out. The key turned in the lock.\\n\"I wonder who \\'they\\' are,\" mused Tommy, as he continued to make\\ninroads on the loaf. \"With a bit of luck, that girl might help\\nme to get out of here. She doesn\\'t look like one of the gang.\"\\nAt one o\\'clock Annette reappeared with another tray, but this\\ntime Conrad accompanied her.\\n\"Good morning,\" said Tommy amiably. \"You have NOT used Pear\\'s\\nsoap, I see.\"\\nConrad growled threateningly.\\n\"No light repartee, have you, old bean? There, there, we can\\'t\\nalways have brains as well as beauty. What have we for lunch?\\nStew? How did I know? Elementary, my dear Watson--the smell of\\nonions is unmistakable.\"\\n\"Talk away,\" grunted the man. \"It\\'s little enough time you\\'ll\\nhave to talk in, maybe.\"\\nThe remark was unpleasant in its suggestion, but Tommy ignored\\nit. He sat down at the table.\\n\"Retire, varlet,\" he said, with a wave of his hand. \"Prate not to\\nthy betters.\"\\nThat evening Tommy sat on the bed, and cogitated deeply. Would\\nConrad again accompany the girl? If he did not, should he risk\\ntrying to make an ally of her? He decided that he must leave no\\nstone unturned. His position was desperate.\\nAt eight o\\'clock the familiar sound of the key turning made him\\nspring to his feet. The girl was alone.\\n\"Shut the door,\" he commanded. \"I want to speak to you.\" She\\nobeyed.\\n\"Look here, Annette, I want you to help me get out of this.\" She\\nshook her head.\\n\"Impossible. There are three of them on the floor below.\"\\n\"Oh!\" Tommy was secretly grateful for the information. \"But you\\nwould help me if you could?\"\\n\"No, monsieur.\"\\n\"Why not?\"\\nThe girl hesitated.\\n\"I think--they are my own people. You have spied upon them. They\\nare quite right to keep you here.\"\\n\"They\\'re a bad lot, Annette. If you\\'ll help me, I\\'ll take you\\naway from the lot of them. And you\\'d probably get a good whack\\nof money.\"\\nBut the girl merely shook her head.\\n\"I dare not, monsieur; I am afraid of them.\"\\nShe turned away.\\n\"Wouldn\\'t you do anything to help another girl?\" cried Tommy.\\n\"She\\'s about your age too. Won\\'t you save her from their\\nclutches?\"\\n\"You mean Jane Finn?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"It is her you came here to look for? Yes?\"\\n\"That\\'s it.\"\\nThe girl looked at him, then passed her hand across her forehead.\\n\"Jane Finn. Always I hear that name. It is familiar.\"\\nTommy came forward eagerly.\\n\"You must know SOMETHING about her?\"\\nBut the girl turned away abruptly.\\n\"I know nothing--only the name.\" She walked towards the door.\\nSuddenly she uttered a cry. Tommy stared. She had caught sight\\nof the picture he had laid against the wall the night before. For\\na moment he caught a look of terror in her eyes. As inexplicably\\nit changed to relief. Then abruptly she went out of the room.\\nTommy could make nothing of it. Did she fancy that he had meant\\nto attack her with it? Surely not. He rehung the picture on the\\nwall thoughtfully.\\nThree more days went by in dreary inaction. Tommy felt the\\nstrain telling on his nerves. He saw no one but Conrad and\\nAnnette, and the girl had become dumb. She spoke only in\\nmonosyllables. A kind of dark suspicion smouldered in her eyes.\\nTommy felt that if this solitary confinement went on much longer\\nhe would go mad. He gathered from Conrad that they were waiting\\nfor orders from \"Mr. Brown.\" Perhaps, thought Tommy, he was\\nabroad or away, and they were obliged to wait for his return.\\nBut the evening of the third day brought a rude awakening.\\nIt was barely seven o\\'clock when he heard the tramp of footsteps\\noutside in the passage. In another minute the door was flung\\nopen. Conrad entered. With him was the evil-looking Number 14.\\nTommy\\'s heart sank at the sight of them.\\n\"Evenin\\', gov\\'nor,\" said the man with a leer. \"Got those ropes,\\nmate?\"\\nThe silent Conrad produced a length of fine cord. The next\\nminute Number 14\\'s hands, horribly dexterous, were winding the\\ncord round his limbs, while Conrad held him down.\\n\"What the devil----?\" began Tommy.\\nBut the slow, speechless grin of the silent Conrad froze the\\nwords on his lips.\\nNumber 14 proceeded deftly with his task. In another minute\\nTommy was a mere helpless bundle. Then at last Conrad spoke:\\n\"Thought you\\'d bluffed us, did you? With what you knew, and what\\nyou didn\\'t know. Bargained with us! And all the time it was\\nbluff! Bluff! You know less than a kitten. But your number\\'s up\\nnow all right, you b----swine.\"\\nTommy lay silent. There was nothing to say. He had failed.\\nSomehow or other the omnipotent Mr. Brown had seen through his\\npretensions. Suddenly a thought occurred to him.\\n\"A very good speech, Conrad,\" he said approvingly. \"But wherefore\\nthe bonds and fetters? Why not let this kind gentleman here cut\\nmy throat without delay?\"\\n\"Garn,\" said Number 14 unexpectedly. \"Think we\\'re as green as to\\ndo you in here, and have the police nosing round? Not \\'alf!\\nWe\\'ve ordered the carriage for your lordship to-morrow mornin\\',\\nbut in the meantime we\\'re not taking any chances, see!\"\\n\"Nothing,\" said Tommy, \"could be plainer than your words--unless\\nit was your face.\"\\n\"Stow it,\" said Number 14.\\n\"With pleasure,\" replied Tommy. \"You\\'re making a sad\\nmistake--but yours will be the loss.\"\\n\"You don\\'t kid us that way again,\" said Number 14. \"Talking as\\nthough you were still at the blooming Ritz, aren\\'t you?\"\\nTommy made no reply. He was engaged in wondering how Mr. Brown\\nhad discovered his identity. He decided that Tuppence, in the\\nthroes of anxiety, had gone to the police, and that his\\ndisappearance having been made public the gang had not been slow\\nto put two and two together.\\nThe two men departed and the door slammed. Tommy was left to his\\nmeditations. They were not pleasant ones. Already his limbs felt\\ncramped and stiff. He was utterly helpless, and he could see no\\nhope anywhere.\\nAbout an hour had passed when he heard the key softly turned, and\\nthe door opened. It was Annette. Tommy\\'s heart beat a little\\nfaster. He had forgotten the girl. Was it possible that she had\\ncome to his help?\\nSuddenly he heard Conrad\\'s voice:\\n\"Come out of it, Annette. He doesn\\'t want any supper to-night.\"\\n\"Oui, oui, je sais bien. But I must take the other tray. We need\\nthe things on it.\"\\n\"Well, hurry up,\" growled Conrad.\\nWithout looking at Tommy the girl went over to the table, and\\npicked up the tray. She raised a hand and turned out the light.\\n\"Curse you\"--Conrad had come to the door--\"why did you do that?\"\\n\"I always turn it out. You should have told me. Shall I relight\\nit, Monsieur Conrad?\"\\n\"No, come on out of it.\"\\n\"Le beau petit monsieur,\" cried Annette, pausing by the bed in\\nthe darkness. \"You have tied him up well, hein? He is like a\\ntrussed chicken!\" The frank amusement in her tone jarred on the\\nboy; but at that moment, to his amazement, he felt her hand\\nrunning lightly over his bonds, and something small and cold was\\npressed into the palm of his hand.\\n\"Come on, Annette.\"\\n\"Mais me voila.\"\\nThe door shut. Tommy heard Conrad say:\\n\"Lock it and give me the key.\"\\nThe footsteps died away. Tommy lay petrified with amazement. The\\nobject Annette had thrust into his hand was a small penknife, the\\nblade open. From the way she had studiously avoided looking at\\nhim, and her action with the light, he came to the conclusion\\nthat the room was overlooked. There must be a peep-hole somewhere\\nin the walls. Remembering how guarded she had always been in her\\nmanner, he saw that he had probably been under observation all\\nthe time. Had he said anything to give himself away? Hardly. He\\nhad revealed a wish to escape and a desire to find Jane Finn, but\\nnothing that could have given a clue to his own identity. True,\\nhis question to Annette had proved that he was personally\\nunacquainted with Jane Finn, but he had never pretended\\notherwise. The question now was, did Annette really know more?\\nWere her denials intended primarily for the listeners? On that\\npoint he could come to no conclusion.\\nBut there was a more vital question that drove out all others.\\nCould he, bound as he was, manage to cut his bonds? He essayed\\ncautiously to rub the open blade up and down on the cord that\\nbound his two wrists together. It was an awkward business, and\\ndrew a smothered \"Ow\" of pain from him as the knife cut into his\\nwrist. But slowly and doggedly he went on sawing to and fro. He\\ncut the flesh badly, but at last he felt the cord slacken. With\\nhis hands free, the rest was easy. Five minutes later he stood\\nupright with some difficulty, owing to the cramp in his limbs.\\nHis first care was to bind up his bleeding wrist. Then he sat on\\nthe edge of the bed to think. Conrad had taken the key of the\\ndoor, so he could expect little more assistance from Annette.\\nThe only outlet from the room was the door, consequently he would\\nperforce have to wait until the two men returned to fetch him.\\nBut when they did . . . Tommy smiled! Moving with infinite\\ncaution in the dark room, he found and unhooked the famous\\npicture. He felt an economical pleasure that his first plan would\\nnot be wasted. There was now nothing to do but to wait. He\\nwaited.\\nThe night passed slowly. Tommy lived through an eternity of\\nhours, but at last he heard footsteps. He stood upright, drew a\\ndeep breath, and clutched the picture firmly.\\nThe door opened. A faint light streamed in from outside. Conrad\\nwent straight towards the gas to light it. Tommy deeply regretted\\nthat it was he who had entered first. It would have been pleasant\\nto get even with Conrad. Number 14 followed. As he stepped\\nacross the threshold, Tommy brought the picture down with\\nterrific force on his head. Number 14 went down amidst a\\nstupendous crash of broken glass. In a minute Tommy had slipped\\nout and pulled to the door. The key was in the lock. He turned\\nit and withdrew it just as Conrad hurled himself against the door\\nfrom the inside with a volley of curses.\\nFor a moment Tommy hesitated. There was the sound of some one\\nstirring on the floor below. Then the German\\'s voice came up the\\nstairs.\\n\"Gott im Himmel! Conrad, what is it?\"\\nTommy felt a small hand thrust into his. Beside him stood\\nAnnette. She pointed up a rickety ladder that apparently led to\\nsome attics.\\n\"Quick--up here!\" She dragged him after her up the ladder. In\\nanother moment they were standing in a dusty garret littered with\\nlumber. Tommy looked round.\\n\"This won\\'t do. It\\'s a regular trap. There\\'s no way out.\"\\n\"Hush! Wait.\" The girl put her finger to her lips. She crept to\\nthe top of the ladder and listened.\\nThe banging and beating on the door was terrific. The German and\\nanother were trying to force the door in. Annette explained in a\\nwhisper:\\n\"They will think you are still inside. They cannot hear what\\nConrad says. The door is too thick.\"\\n\"I thought you could hear what went on in the room?\"\\n\"There is a peep-hole into the next room. It was clever of you\\nto guess. But they will not think of that--they are only anxious\\nto get in.\"\\n\"Yes--but look here----\"\\n\"Leave it to me.\" She bent down. To his amazement, Tommy saw\\nthat she was fastening the end of a long piece of string to the\\nhandle of a big cracked jug. She arranged it carefully, then\\nturned to Tommy.\\n\"Have you the key of the door?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Give it to me.\"\\nHe handed it to her.\\n\"I am going down. Do you think you can go halfway, and then\\nswing yourself down BEHIND the ladder, so that they will not see\\nyou?\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"There\\'s a big cupboard in the shadow of the landing. Stand\\nbehind it. Take the end of this string in your hand. When I\\'ve\\nlet the others out--PULL!\"\\nBefore he had time to ask her anything more, she had flitted\\nlightly down the ladder and was in the midst of the group with a\\nloud cry:\\n\"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Qu\\'est-ce qu\\'il y a?\"\\nThe German turned on her with an oath.\\n\"Get out of this. Go to your room!\"\\nVery cautiously Tommy swung himself down the back of the ladder.\\nSo long as they did not turn round ... all was well. He crouched\\nbehind the cupboard. They were still between him and the stairs.\\n\"AH!\" Annette appeared to stumble over something. She stooped.\\n\"Mon Dieu, voila la clef!\"\\nThe German snatched it from her. He unlocked the door. Conrad\\nstumbled out, swearing.\\n\"Where is he? Have you got him?\"\\n\"We have seen no one,\" said the German sharply. His face paled.\\n\"Who do you mean?\"\\nConrad gave vent to another oath.\\n\"He\\'s got away.\"\\n\"Impossible. He would have passed us.\"\\nAt that moment, with an ecstatic smile Tommy pulled the string. A\\ncrash of crockery came from the attic above. In a trice the men\\nwere pushing each other up the rickety ladder and had disappeared\\ninto the darkness above.\\nQuick as a flash Tommy leapt from his hiding-place and dashed\\ndown the stairs, pulling the girl with him. There was no one in\\nthe hall. He fumbled over the bolts and chain. At last they\\nyielded, the door swung open. He turned. Annette had\\ndisappeared.\\nTommy stood spell-bound. Had she run upstairs again? What\\nmadness possessed her! He fumed with impatience, but he stood\\nhis ground. He would not go without her.\\nAnd suddenly there was an outcry overhead, an exclamation from\\nthe German, and then Annette\\'s voice, clear and high:\\n\"Ma foi, he has escaped! And quickly! Who would have thought\\nit?\"\\nTommy still stood rooted to the ground. Was that a command to\\nhim to go? He fancied it was.\\nAnd then, louder still, the words floated down to him:\\n\"This is a terrible house. I want to go back to Marguerite. To\\nMarguerite. TO MARGUERITE!\"\\nTommy had run back to the stairs. She wanted him to go and leave\\nher. But why? At all costs he must try and get her away with\\nhim. Then his heart sank. Conrad was leaping down the stairs,\\nuttering a savage cry at the sight of him. After him came the\\nothers.\\nTommy stopped Conrad\\'s rush with a straight blow with his fist.\\nIt caught the other on the point of the jaw and he fell like a\\nlog. The second man tripped over his body and fell. From higher\\nup the staircase there was a flash, and a bullet grazed Tommy\\'s\\near. He realized that it would be good for his health to get out\\nof this house as soon as possible. As regards Annette he could\\ndo nothing. He had got even with Conrad, which was one\\nsatisfaction. The blow had been a good one.\\nHe leapt for the door, slamming it behind him. The square was\\ndeserted. In front of the house was a baker\\'s van. Evidently he\\nwas to have been taken out of London in that, and his body found\\nmany miles from the house in Soho. The driver jumped to the\\npavement and tried to bar Tommy\\'s way. Again Tommy\\'s fist shot\\nout, and the driver sprawled on the pavement.\\nTommy took to his heels and ran--none too soon. The front door\\nopened and a hail of bullets followed him. Fortunately none of\\nthem hit him. He turned the corner of the square.\\n\"There\\'s one thing,\" he thought to himself, \"they can\\'t go on\\nshooting. They\\'ll have the police after them if they do. I\\nwonder they dared to there.\"\\nHe heard the footsteps of his pursuers behind him, and redoubled\\nhis own pace. Once he got out of these by-ways he would be safe.\\nThere would be a policeman about somewhere--not that he really\\nwanted to invoke the aid of the police if he could possibly do\\nwithout it. It meant explanations, and general awkwardness. In\\nanother moment he had reason to bless his luck. He stumbled over\\na prostrate figure, which started up with a yell of alarm and\\ndashed off down the street. Tommy drew back into a doorway. In a\\nminute he had the pleasure of seeing his two pursuers, of whom\\nthe German was one, industriously tracking down the red herring!\\nTommy sat down quietly on the doorstep and allowed a few moments\\nto elapse while he recovered his breath. Then he strolled gently\\nin the opposite direction. He glanced at his watch. It was a\\nlittle after half-past five. It was rapidly growing light. At\\nthe next corner he passed a policeman. The policeman cast a\\nsuspicious eye on him. Tommy felt slightly offended. Then,\\npassing his hand over his face, he laughed. He had not shaved or\\nwashed for three days! What a guy he must look.\\nHe betook himself without more ado to a Turkish Bath\\nestablishment which he knew to be open all night. He emerged into\\nthe busy daylight feeling himself once more, and able to make\\nplans.\\nFirst of all, he must have a square meal. He had eaten nothing\\nsince midday yesterday. He turned into an A.B.C. shop and\\nordered eggs and bacon and coffee. Whilst he ate, he read a\\nmorning paper propped up in front of him. Suddenly he stiffened.\\nThere was a long article on Kramenin, who was described as the\\n\"man behind Bolshevism\" in Russia, and who had just arrived in\\nLondon--some thought as an unofficial envoy. His career was\\nsketched lightly, and it was firmly asserted that he, and not the\\nfigurehead leaders, had been the author of the Russian\\nRevolution.\\nIn the centre of the page was his portrait.\\n\"So that\\'s who Number 1 is,\" said Tommy with his mouth full of\\neggs and bacon. \"Not a doubt about it, I must push on.\"\\nHe paid for his breakfast, and betook himself to Whitehall. There\\nhe sent up his name, and the message that it was urgent. A few\\nminutes later he was in the presence of the man who did not here\\ngo by the name of \"Mr. Carter.\" There was a frown on his face.\\n\"Look here, you\\'ve no business to come asking for me in this way.\\nI thought that was distinctly understood?\"\\n\"It was, sir. But I judged it important to lose no time.\"\\nAnd as briefly and succinctly as possible he detailed the\\nexperiences of the last few days.\\nHalf-way through, Mr. Carter interrupted him to give a few\\ncryptic orders through the telephone. All traces of displeasure\\nhad now left his face. He nodded energetically when Tommy had\\nfinished.\\n\"Quite right. Every moment\\'s of value. Fear we shall be too\\nlate anyway. They wouldn\\'t wait. Would clear out at once.\\nStill, they may have left something behind them that will be a\\nclue. You say you\\'ve recognized Number 1 to be Kramenin? That\\'s\\nimportant. We want something against him badly to prevent the\\nCabinet falling on his neck too freely. What about the others?\\nYou say two faces were familiar to you? One\\'s a Labour man, you\\nthink? Just look through these photos, and see if you can spot\\nhim.\"\\nA minute later, Tommy held one up. Mr. Carter exhibited some\\nsurprise.\\n\"Ah, Westway! Shouldn\\'t have thought it. Poses as being\\nmoderate. As for the other fellow, I think I can give a good\\nguess.\" He handed another photograph to Tommy, and smiled at the\\nother\\'s exclamation. \"I\\'m right, then. Who is he? Irishman.\\nProminent Unionist M.P. All a blind, of course. We\\'ve suspected\\nit--but couldn\\'t get any proof. Yes, you\\'ve done very well, young\\nman. The 29th, you say, is the date. That gives us very little\\ntime--very little time indeed.\"\\n\"But----\" Tommy hesitated.\\nMr. Carter read his thoughts.\\n\"We can deal with the General Strike menace, I think. It\\'s a\\ntoss-up--but we\\'ve got a sporting chance! But if that draft\\ntreaty turns up--we\\'re done. England will be plunged in anarchy.\\nAh, what\\'s that? The car? Come on, Beresford, we\\'ll go and have\\na look at this house of yours.\"\\nTwo constables were on duty in front of the house in Soho. An\\ninspector reported to Mr. Carter in a low voice. The latter\\nturned to Tommy.\\n\"The birds have flown--as we thought. We might as well go over\\nit.\"\\nGoing over the deserted house seemed to Tommy to partake of the\\ncharacter of a dream. Everything was just as it had been. The\\nprison room with the crooked pictures, the broken jug in the\\nattic, the meeting room with its long table. But nowhere was\\nthere a trace of papers. Everything of that kind had either been\\ndestroyed or taken away. And there was no sign of Annette.\\n\"What you tell me about the girl puzzled me,\" said Mr. Carter.\\n\"You believe that she deliberately went back?\"\\n\"It would seem so, sir. She ran upstairs while I was getting.\\nthe door open.\"\\n\"H\\'m, she must belong to the gang, then; but, being a woman,\\ndidn\\'t feel like standing by to see a personable young man\\nkilled. But evidently she\\'s in with them, or she wouldn\\'t have\\ngone back.\"\\n\"I can\\'t believe she\\'s really one of them, sir. She--seemed so\\ndifferent----\"\\n\"Good-looking, I suppose?\" said Mr. Carter with a smile that made\\nTommy flush to the roots of his hair. He admitted Annette\\'s\\nbeauty rather shamefacedly.\\n\"By the way,\" observed Mr. Carter, \"have you shown yourself to\\nMiss Tuppence yet? She\\'s been bombarding me with letters about\\nyou.\"\\n\"Tuppence? I was afraid she might get a bit rattled. Did she go\\nto the police?\"\\nMr. Carter shook his head.\\n\"Then I wonder how they twigged me.\"\\nMr. Carter looked inquiringly at him, and Tommy explained. The\\nother nodded thoughtfully.\\n\"True, that\\'s rather a curious point. Unless the mention of the\\nRitz was an accidental remark?\"\\n\"It might have been, sir. But they must have found out about me\\nsuddenly in some way.\"\\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Carter, looking round him, \"there\\'s nothing more\\nto be done here. What about some lunch with me?\"\\n\"Thanks awfully, sir. But I think I\\'d better get back and rout\\nout Tuppence.\"\\n\"Of course. Give her my kind regards and tell her not to believe\\nyou\\'re killed too readily next time.\"\\nTommy grinned.\\n\"I take a lot of killing, sir.\"\\n\"So I perceive,\" said Mr. Carter dryly. \"Well, good-bye.\\nRemember you\\'re a marked man now, and take reasonable care of\\nyourself.\"\\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\\nHailing a taxi briskly Tommy stepped in, and was swiftly borne to\\nthe Ritz\\' dwelling the while on the pleasurable anticipation of\\nstartling Tuppence.\\n\"Wonder what she\\'s been up to. Dogging \\'Rita\\' most likely. By\\nthe way, I suppose that\\'s who Annette meant by Marguerite. I\\ndidn\\'t get it at the time.\" The thought saddened him a little,\\nfor it seemed to prove that Mrs. Vandemeyer and the girl were on\\nintimate terms.\\nThe taxi drew up at the Ritz. Tommy burst into its sacred\\nportals eagerly, but his enthusiasm received a check. He was\\ninformed that Miss Cowley had gone out a quarter of an hour ago.\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\nTHE TELEGRAM\\nBAFFLED for the moment, Tommy strolled into the restaurant, and\\nordered a meal of surpassing excellence. His four days\\'\\nimprisonment had taught him anew to value good food.\\nHe was in the middle of conveying a particularly choice morsel of\\nSole a la Jeanette to his mouth, when he caught sight of Julius\\nentering the room. Tommy waved a menu cheerfully, and succeeded\\nin attracting the other\\'s attention. At the sight of Tommy,\\nJulius\\'s eyes seemed as though they would pop out of his head.\\nHe strode across, and pump-handled Tommy\\'s hand with what seemed\\nto the latter quite unnecessary vigour.\\n\"Holy snakes!\" he ejaculated. \"Is it really you?\"\\n\"Of course it is. Why shouldn\\'t it be?\"\\n\"Why shouldn\\'t it be? Say, man, don\\'t you know you\\'ve been given\\nup for dead? I guess we\\'d have had a solemn requiem for you in\\nanother few days.\"\\n\"Who thought I was dead?\" demanded Tommy.\\n\"Tuppence.\"\\n\"She remembered the proverb about the good dying young, I\\nsuppose. There must be a certain amount of original sin in me to\\nhave survived. Where is Tuppence, by the way?\"\\n\"Isn\\'t she here?\"\\n\"No, the fellows at the office said she\\'d just gone out.\"\\n\"Gone shopping, I guess. I dropped her here in the car about an\\nhour ago. But, say, can\\'t you shed that British calm of yours,\\nand get down to it? What on God\\'s earth have you been doing all\\nthis time?\"\\n\"If you\\'re feeding here,\" replied Tommy, \"order now. It\\'s going\\nto be a long story.\"\\nJulius drew up a chair to the opposite side of the table,\\nsummoned a hovering waiter, and dictated his wishes. Then he\\nturned to Tommy.\\n\"Fire ahead. I guess you\\'ve had some few adventures.\"\\n\"One or two,\" replied Tommy modestly, and plunged into his\\nrecital.\\nJulius listened spellbound. Half the dishes that were placed\\nbefore him he forgot to eat. At the end he heaved a long sigh.\\n\"Bully for you. Reads like a dime novel!\"\\n\"And now for the home front,\" said Tommy, stretching out his hand\\nfor a peach.\\n\"We-el,\" drawled Julius, \"I don\\'t mind admitting we\\'ve had some\\nadventures too.\"\\nHe, in his turn, assumed the role of narrator. Beginning with his\\nunsuccessful reconnoitring at Bournemouth, he passed on to his\\nreturn to London, the buying of the car, the growing anxieties of\\nTuppence, the call upon Sir James, and the sensational\\noccurrences of the previous night.\\n\"But who killed her?\" asked Tommy. \"I don\\'t quite understand.\"\\n\"The doctor kidded himself she took it herself,\" replied Julius\\ndryly.\\n\"And Sir James? What did he think?\"\\n\"Being a legal luminary, he is likewise a human oyster,\" replied\\nJulius. \"I should say he \\'reserved judgment.\\' \" He went on to\\ndetail the events of the morning.\\n\"Lost her memory, eh?\" said Tommy with interest. \"By Jove, that\\nexplains why they looked at me so queerly when I spoke of\\nquestioning her. Bit of a slip on my part, that! But it wasn\\'t\\nthe sort of thing a fellow would be likely to guess.\"\\n\"They didn\\'t give you any sort of hint as to where Jane was?\"\\nTommy shook his head regretfully.\\n\"Not a word. I\\'m a bit of an ass, as you know. I ought to have\\ngot more out of them somehow.\"\\n\"I guess you\\'re lucky to be here at all. That bluff of yours was\\nthe goods all right. How you ever came to think of it all so pat\\nbeats me to a frazzle!\"\\n\"I was in such a funk I had to think of something,\" said Tommy\\nsimply.\\nThere was a moment\\'s pause, and then Tommy reverted to Mrs.\\nVandemeyer\\'s death.\\n\"There\\'s no doubt it was chloral?\"\\n\"I believe not. At least they call it heart failure induced by\\nan overdose, or some such claptrap. It\\'s all right. We don\\'t\\nwant to be worried with an inquest. But I guess Tuppence and I\\nand even the highbrow Sir James have all got the same idea.\"\\n\"Mr. Brown?\" hazarded Tommy.\\n\"Sure thing.\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"All the same,\" he said thoughtfully, \"Mr. Brown hasn\\'t got\\nwings. I don\\'t see how he got in and out.\"\\n\"How about some high-class thought transference stunt? Some\\nmagnetic influence that irresistibly impelled Mrs. Vandemeyer to\\ncommit suicide?\"\\nTommy looked at him with respect.\\n\"Good, Julius. Distinctly good. Especially the phraseology. But\\nit leaves me cold. I yearn for a real Mr. Brown of flesh and\\nblood. I think the gifted young detectives must get to work,\\nstudy the entrances and exits, and tap the bumps on their\\nforeheads until the solution of the mystery dawns on them. Let\\'s\\ngo round to the scene of the crime. I wish we could get hold of\\nTuppence. The Ritz would enjoy the spectacle of the glad\\nreunion.\"\\nInquiry at the office revealed the fact that Tuppence had not yet\\nreturned.\\n\"All the same, I guess I\\'ll have a look round upstairs,\" said\\nJulius. \"She might be in my sitting-room.\" He disappeared.\\nSuddenly a diminutive boy spoke at Tommy\\'s elbow:\\n\"The young lady--she\\'s gone away by train, I think, sir,\" he\\nmurmured shyly.\\n\"What?\" Tommy wheeled round upon him.\\nThe small boy became pinker than before.\\n\"The taxi, sir. I heard her tell the driver Charing Cross and to\\nlook sharp.\"\\nTommy stared at him, his eyes opening wide in surprise.\\nEmboldened, the small boy proceeded. \"So I thought, having asked\\nfor an A.B.C. and a Bradshaw.\"\\nTommy interrupted him:\\n\"When did she ask for an A.B.C. and a Bradshaw?\"\\n\"When I took her the telegram, sir.\"\\n\"A telegram?\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\"When was that?\"\\n\"About half-past twelve, sir.\"\\n\"Tell me exactly what happened.\"\\nThe small boy drew a long breath.\\n\"I took up a telegram to No. 891--the lady was there. She opened\\nit and gave a gasp, and then she said, very jolly like: \\'Bring me\\nup a Bradshaw, and an A.B.C., and look sharp, Henry.\\' My name\\nisn\\'t Henry, but----\"\\n\"Never mind your name,\" said Tommy impatiently. \"Go on.\"\\n\"Yes, sir. I brought them, and she told me to wait, and looked\\nup something. And then she looks up at the clock, and \\'Hurry up,\\'\\nshe says. \\'Tell them to get me a taxi,\\' and she begins a-shoving\\non of her hat in front of the glass, and she was down in two\\nticks, almost as quick as I was, and I seed her going down the\\nsteps and into the taxi, and I heard her call out what I told\\nyou.\"\\nThe small boy stopped and replenished his lungs. Tommy continued\\nto stare at him. At that moment Julius rejoined him. He held an\\nopen letter in his hand.\\n\"I say, Hersheimmer\"--Tommy turned to him--\"Tuppence has gone off\\nsleuthing on her own.\"\\n\"Shucks!\"\\n\"Yes, she has. She went off in a taxi to Charing Cross in the\\ndeuce of a hurry after getting a telegram.\" His eye fell on the\\nletter in Julius\\'s hand. \"Oh; she left a note for you. That\\'s\\nall right. Where\\'s she off to?\"\\nAlmost unconsciously, he held out his hand for the letter, but\\nJulius folded it up and placed it in his pocket. He seemed a\\ntrifle embarrassed.\\n\"I guess this is nothing to do with it. It\\'s about something\\nelse--something I asked her that she was to let me know about.\"\\n\"Oh!\" Tommy looked puzzled, and seemed waiting for more.\\n\"See here,\" said Julius suddenly, \"I\\'d better put you wise. I\\nasked Miss Tuppence to marry me this morning.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tommy mechanically. He felt dazed. Julius\\'s words\\nwere totally unexpected. For the moment they benumbed his brain.\\n\"I\\'d like to tell you,\" continued Julius, \"that before I\\nsuggested anything of the kind to Miss Tuppence, I made it clear\\nthat I didn\\'t want to butt in in any way between her and you----\"\\nTommy roused himself.\\n\"That\\'s all right,\" he said quickly. \"Tuppence and I have been\\npals for years. Nothing more.\" He lit a cigarette with a hand\\nthat shook ever so little. \"That\\'s quite all right. Tuppence\\nalways said that she was looking out for----\"\\nHe stopped abruptly, his face crimsoning, but Julius was in no\\nway discomposed.\\n\"Oh, I guess it\\'ll be the dollars that\\'ll do the trick. Miss\\nTuppence put me wise to that right away. There\\'s no humbug about\\nher. We ought to gee along together very well.\"\\nTommy looked at him curiously for a minute, as though he were\\nabout to speak, then changed his mind and said nothing. Tuppence\\nand Julius! Well, why not? Had she not lamented the fact that\\nshe knew no rich men? Had she not openly avowed her intention of\\nmarrying for money if she ever had the chance? Her meeting with\\nthe young American millionaire had given her the chance--and it\\nwas unlikely she would be slow to avail herself of it. She was\\nout for money. She had always said so. Why blame her because\\nshe had been true to her creed?\\nNevertheless, Tommy did blame her. He was filled with a\\npassionate and utterly illogical resentment. It was all very\\nwell to SAY things like that--but a REAL girl would never marry\\nfor money. Tuppence was utterly cold-blooded and selfish, and he\\nwould be delighted if he never saw her again! And it was a\\nrotten world!\\nJulius\\'s voice broke in on these meditations.\\n\"Yes, we ought to get along together very well. I\\'ve heard that\\na girl always refuses you once--a sort of convention.\"\\nTommy caught his arm.\\n\"Refuses? Did you say REFUSES?\"\\n\"Sure thing. Didn\\'t I tell you that? She just rapped out a \\'no\\'\\nwithout any kind of reason to it. The eternal feminine, the Huns\\ncall it, I\\'ve heard. But she\\'ll come round right enough. Likely\\nenough, I hustled her some----\"\\nBut Tommy interrupted regardless of decorum.\\n\"What did she say in that note?\" he demanded fiercely.\\nThe obliging Julius handed it to him.\\n\"There\\'s no earthly clue in it as to where she\\'s gone,\" he\\nassured Tommy. \"But you might as well see for yourself if you\\ndon\\'t believe me.\"\\nThe note, in Tuppence\\'s well-known schoolboy writing, ran as\\nfollows:\\n\"DEAR JULIUS,\\n\"It\\'s always better to have things in black and white. I don\\'t\\nfeel I can be bothered to think of marriage until Tommy is found.\\nLet\\'s leave it till then.\\n\"Yours affectionately,\\n\"TUPPENCE.\"\\nTommy handed it back, his eyes shining. His feelings had\\nundergone a sharp reaction. He now felt that Tuppence was all\\nthat was noble and disinterested. Had she not refused Julius\\nwithout hesitation? True, the note betokened signs of weakening,\\nbut he could excuse that. It read almost like a bribe to Julius\\nto spur him on in his efforts to find Tommy, but he supposed she\\nhad not really meant it that way. Darling Tuppence, there was not\\na girl in the world to touch her! When he saw her----His thoughts\\nwere brought up with a sudden jerk.\\n\"As you say,\" he remarked, pulling himself together, \"there\\'s not\\na hint here as to what she\\'s up to. Hi--Henry!\"\\nThe small boy came obediently. Tommy produced five shillings.\\n\"One thing more. Do you remember what the young lady did with\\nthe telegram?\"\\nHenry gasped and spoke.\\n\"She crumpled it up into a ball and threw it into the grate, and\\nmade a sort of noise like \\'Whoop!\\' sir.\"\\n\"Very graphic, Henry,\" said Tommy. \"Here\\'s your five shillings.\\nCome on, Julius. We must find that telegram.\"\\nThey hurried upstairs. Tuppence had left the key in her door.\\nThe room was as she had left it. In the fireplace was a crumpled\\nball of orange and white. Tommy disentangled it and smoothed out\\nthe telegram.\\n\"Come at once, Moat House, Ebury, Yorkshire, great\\ndevelopments--TOMMY.\"\\nThey looked at each other in stupefaction. Julius spoke first:\\n\"You didn\\'t send it?\"\\n\"Of course not. What does it mean?\"\\n\"I guess it means the worst,\" said Julius quietly. \"They\\'ve got\\nher.\"\\n\"WHAT?\"\\n\"Sure thing! They signed your name, and she fell into the trap\\nlike a lamb.\"\\n\"My God! What shall we do?\"\\n\"Get busy, and go after her! Right now! There\\'s no time to\\nwaste. It\\'s almighty luck that she didn\\'t take the wire with her.\\nIf she had we\\'d probably never have traced her. But we\\'ve got to\\nhustle. Where\\'s that Bradshaw?\"\\nThe energy of Julius was infectious. Left to himself, Tommy\\nwould probably have sat down to think things out for a good\\nhalf-hour before he decided on a plan of action. But with Julius\\nHersheimmer about, hustling was inevitable.\\nAfter a few muttered imprecations he handed the Bradshaw to Tommy\\nas being more conversant with its mysteries. Tommy abandoned it\\nin favour of an A.B.C.\\n\"Here we are. Ebury, Yorks. From King\\'s Cross. Or St. Pancras.\\n(Boy must have made a mistake. It was King\\'s Cross, not CHARING\\nCross.) 12.50, that\\'s the train she went by. 2.10, that\\'s gone.\\n3.20 is the next--and a damned slow train too.\"\\n\"What about the car?\"\\nTommy shook his head.\\n\"Send it up if you like, but we\\'d better stick to the train. The\\ngreat thing is to keep calm.\"\\nJulius groaned.\\n\"That\\'s so. But it gets my goat to think of that innocent young\\ngirl in danger!\"\\nTommy nodded abstractedly. He was thinking. In a moment or two,\\nhe said:\\n\"I say, Julius, what do they want her for, anyway?\"\\n\"Eh? I don\\'t get you?\"\\n\"What I mean is that I don\\'t think it\\'s their game to do her any\\nharm,\" explained Tommy, puckering his brow with the strain of his\\nmental processes. \"She\\'s a hostage, that\\'s what she is. She\\'s in\\nno immediate danger, because if we tumble on to anything, she\\'d\\nbe damned useful to them. As long as they\\'ve got her, they\\'ve got\\nthe whip hand of us. See?\"\\n\"Sure thing,\" said Julius thoughtfully. \"That\\'s so.\"\\n\"Besides,\" added Tommy, as an afterthought, \"I\\'ve great faith in\\nTuppence.\"\\nThe journey was wearisome, with many stops, and crowded\\ncarriages. They had to change twice, once at Doncaster, once at a\\nsmall junction. Ebury was a deserted station with a solitary\\nporter, to whom Tommy addressed himself:\\n\"Can you tell me the way to the Moat House?\"\\n\"The Moat House? It\\'s a tidy step from here. The big house near\\nthe sea, you mean?\"\\nTommy assented brazenly. After listening to the porter\\'s\\nmeticulous but perplexing directions, they prepared to leave the\\nstation. It was beginning to rain, and they turned up the collars\\nof their coats as they trudged through the slush of the road.\\nSuddenly Tommy halted.\\n\"Wait a moment.\" He ran back to the station and tackled the\\nporter anew.\\n\"Look here, do you remember a young lady who arrived by an\\nearlier train, the 12.50 from London? She\\'d probably ask you the\\nway to the Moat House.\"\\nHe described Tuppence as well as he could, but the porter shook\\nhis head. Several people had arrived by the train in question.\\nHe could not call to mind one young lady in particular. But he\\nwas quite certain that no one had asked him the way to the Moat\\nHouse.\\nTommy rejoined Julius, and explained. Depression was settling on\\nhim like a leaden weight. He felt convinced that their quest was\\ngoing to be unsuccessful. The enemy had over three hours\\' start.\\nThree hours was more than enough for Mr. Brown. He would not\\nignore the possibility of the telegram having been found.\\nThe way seemed endless. Once they took the wrong turning and\\nwent nearly half a mile out of their direction. It was past seven\\no\\'clock when a small boy told them that \"t\\' Moat House\" was just\\npast the next corner.\\nA rusty iron gate swinging dismally on its hinges! An overgrown\\ndrive thick with leaves. There was something about the place\\nthat struck a chill to both their hearts. They went up the\\ndeserted drive. The leaves deadened their footsteps. The\\ndaylight was almost gone. It was like walking in a world of\\nghosts. Overhead the branches flapped and creaked with a mournful\\nnote. Occasionally a sodden leaf drifted silently down, startling\\nthem with its cold touch on their cheek.\\nA turn of the drive brought them in sight of the house. That,\\ntoo, seemed empty and deserted. The shutters were closed, the\\nsteps up to the door overgrown with moss. Was it indeed to this\\ndesolate spot that Tuppence had been decoyed? It seemed hard to\\nbelieve that a human footstep had passed this way for months.\\nJulius jerked the rusty bell handle. A jangling peal rang\\ndiscordantly, echoing through the emptiness within. No one came.\\nThey rang again and again--but there was no sign of life. Then\\nthey walked completely round the house. Everywhere silence, and\\nshuttered windows. If they could believe the evidence of their\\neyes the place was empty.\\n\"Nothing doing,\" said Julius.\\nThey retraced their steps slowly to the gate.\\n\"There must be a village handy,\" continued the young American.\\n\"We\\'d better make inquiries there. They\\'ll know something about\\nthe place, and whether there\\'s been anyone there lately.\"\\n\"Yes, that\\'s not a bad idea.\"\\nProceeding up the road, they soon came to a little hamlet. On the\\noutskirts of it, they met a workman swinging his bag of tools,\\nand Tommy stopped him with a question.\\n\"The Moat House? It\\'s empty. Been empty for years. Mrs;\\nSweeny\\'s got the key if you want to go over it--next to the post\\noffice.\"\\nTommy thanked him. They soon found the post office, which was\\nalso a sweet and general fancy shop, and knocked at the door of\\nthe cottage next to it. A clean, wholesome-looking woman opened\\nit. She readily produced the key of the Moat House.\\n\"Though I doubt if it\\'s the kind of place to suit you, sir. In a\\nterrible state of repair. Ceilings leaking and all. \\'Twould need\\na lot of money spent on it.\"\\n\"Thanks,\" said Tommy cheerily. \"I dare say it\\'ll be a washout,\\nbut houses are scarce nowadays.\"\\n\"That they are,\" declared the woman heartily. \"My daughter and\\nson-in-law have been looking for a decent cottage for I don\\'t\\nknow how long. It\\'s all the war. Upset things terribly, it has.\\nBut excuse me, sir, it\\'ll be too dark for you to see much of the\\nhouse. Hadn\\'t you better wait until to-morrow?\"\\n\"That\\'s all right. We\\'ll have a look around this evening,\\nanyway. We\\'d have been here before only we lost our way. What\\'s\\nthe best place to stay at for the night round here?\"\\nMrs. Sweeny looked doubtful.\\n\"There\\'s the Yorkshire Arms, but it\\'s not much of a place for\\ngentlemen like you.\"\\n\"Oh, it will do very well. Thanks. By the way, you\\'ve not had a\\nyoung lady here asking for this key to-day?\"\\nThe woman shook her head.\\n\"No one\\'s been over the place for a long time.\"\\n\"Thanks very much.\"\\nThey retraced their steps to the Moat House. As the front door\\nswung back on its hinges, protesting loudly, Julius struck a\\nmatch and examined the floor carefully. Then he shook his head.\\n\"I\\'d swear no one\\'s passed this way. Look at the dust. Thick.\\nNot a sign of a footmark.\"\\nThey wandered round the deserted house. Everywhere the same\\ntale. Thick layers of dust apparently undisturbed.\\n\"This gets me,\" said Julius. \"I don\\'t believe Tuppence was ever\\nin this house.\"\\n\"She must have been.\"\\nJulius shook his head without replying.\\n\"We\\'ll go over it again to-morrow,\" said Tommy. \"Perhaps we\\'ll\\nsee more in the daylight.\"\\nOn the morrow they took up the search once more, and were\\nreluctantly forced to the conclusion that the house had not been\\ninvaded for some considerable time. They might have left the\\nvillage altogether but for a fortunate discovery of Tommy\\'s. As\\nthey were retracing their steps to the gate, he gave a sudden\\ncry, and stooping, picked something up from among the leaves, and\\nheld it out to Julius. It was a small gold brooch.\\n\"That\\'s Tuppence\\'s!\"\\n\"Are you sure?\"\\n\"Absolutely. I\\'ve often seen her wear it.\"\\nJulius drew a deep breath.\\n\"I guess that settles it. She came as far as here, anyway.\\nWe\\'ll make that pub our head-quarters, and raise hell round here\\nuntil we find her. Somebody MUST have seen her.\"\\nForthwith the campaign began. Tommy and Julius worked separately\\nand together, but the result was the same. Nobody answering to\\nTuppence\\'s description had been seen in the vicinity. They were\\nbaffled--but not discouraged. Finally they altered their\\ntactics. Tuppence had certainly not remained long in the\\nneighbourhood of the Moat House. That pointed to her having been\\novercome and carried away in a car. They renewed inquiries. Had\\nanyone seen a car standing somewhere near the Moat House that\\nday? Again they met with no success.\\nJulius wired to town for his own car, and they scoured the\\nneighbourhood daily with unflagging zeal. A grey limousine on\\nwhich they had set high hopes was traced to Harrogate, and turned\\nout to be the property of a highly respectable maiden lady!\\nEach day saw them set out on a new quest. Julius was like a\\nhound on the leash. He followed up the slenderest clue. Every\\ncar that had passed through the village on the fateful day was\\ntracked down. He forced his way into country properties and\\nsubmitted the owners of the motors to a searching\\ncross-examination. His apologies were as thorough as his methods,\\nand seldom failed in disarming the indignation of his victims;\\nbut, as day succeeded day, they were no nearer to discovering\\nTuppence\\'s whereabouts. So well had the abduction been planned\\nthat the girl seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.\\nAnd another preoccupation was weighing on Tommy\\'s mind.\\n\"Do you know how long we\\'ve been here?\" he asked one morning as\\nthey sat facing each other at breakfast. \"A week! We\\'re no\\nnearer to finding Tuppence, and NEXT SUNDAY IS THE 29TH!\"\\n\"Shucks!\" said Julius thoughtfully. \"I\\'d almost forgotten about\\nthe 29th. I\\'ve been thinking of nothing but Tuppence.\"\\n\"So have I. At least, I hadn\\'t forgotten about the 29th, but it\\ndidn\\'t seem to matter a damn in comparison to finding Tuppence.\\nBut to-day\\'s the 23rd, and time\\'s getting short. If we\\'re ever\\ngoing to get hold of her at all, we must do it before the\\n29th--her life won\\'t be worth an hour\\'s purchase afterwards. The\\nhostage game will be played out by then. I\\'m beginning to feel\\nthat we\\'ve made a big mistake in the way we\\'ve set about this.\\nWe\\'ve wasted time and we\\'re no forrader.\"\\n\"I\\'m with you there. We\\'ve been a couple of mutts, who\\'ve bitten\\noff a bigger bit than they can chew. I\\'m going to quit fooling\\nright away!\"\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\"I\\'ll tell you. I\\'m going to do what we ought to have done a\\nweek ago. I\\'m going right back to London to put the case in the\\nhands of your British police. We fancied ourselves as sleuths.\\nSleuths! It was a piece of damn-fool foolishness! I\\'m through!\\nI\\'ve had enough of it. Scotland Yard for me!\"\\n\"You\\'re right,\" said Tommy slowly. \"I wish to God we\\'d gone\\nthere right away.\"\\n\"Better late than never. We\\'ve been like a couple of babes\\nplaying \\'Here we go round the Mulberry Bush.\\' Now I\\'m going\\nright along to Scotland Yard to ask them to take me by the hand\\nand show me the way I should go. I guess the professional always\\nscores over the amateur in the end. Are you coming along with\\nme?\"\\nTommy shook his head.\\n\"What\\'s the good? One of us is enough. I might as well stay\\nhere and nose round a bit longer. Something MIGHT turn up. One\\nnever knows.\"\\n\"Sure thing. Well, so long. I\\'ll be back in a couple of shakes\\nwith a few inspectors along. I shall tell them to pick out their\\nbrightest and best.\"\\nBut the course of events was not to follow the plan Julius had\\nlaid down. Later in the day Tommy received a wire:\\n\"Join me Manchester Midland Hotel. Important news--JULIUS.\"\\nAt 7:30 that night Tommy alighted from a slow cross-country\\ntrain. Julius was on the platform.\\n\"Thought you\\'d come by this train if you weren\\'t out when my wire\\narrived.\"\\nTommy grasped him by the arm.\\n\"What is it? Is Tuppence found?\"\\nJulius shook his head.\\n\"No. But I found this waiting in London. Just arrived.\"\\nHe handed the telegraph form to the other. Tommy\\'s eyes opened\\nas he read:\\n\"Jane Finn found. Come Manchester Midland Hotel\\nimmediately--PEEL EDGERTON.\"\\nJulius took the form back and folded it up.\\n\"Queer,\" he said thoughtfully. \"I thought that lawyer chap had\\nquit!\"\\nCHAPTER XIX\\nJANE FINN\\n\"MY train got in half an hour ago,\" explained Julius, as he led\\nthe way out of the station. \"I reckoned you\\'d come by this\\nbefore I left London, and wired accordingly to Sir James. He\\'s\\nbooked rooms for us, and will be round to dine at eight.\"\\n\"What made you think he\\'d ceased to take any interest in the\\ncase?\" asked Tommy curiously.\\n\"What he said,\" replied Julius dryly. \"The old bird\\'s as close\\nas an oyster! Like all the darned lot of them, he wasn\\'t going to\\ncommit himself till he was sure he could deliver the goods.\"\\n\"I wonder,\" said Tommy thoughtfully.\\nJulius turned on him.\\n\"You wonder what?\"\\n\"Whether that was his real reason.\"\\n\"Sure. You bet your life it was.\"\\nTommy shook his head unconvinced.\\nSir James arrived punctually at eight o\\'clock, and Julius\\nintroduced Tommy. Sir James shook hands with him warmly.\\n\"I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Mr. Beresford. I have\\nheard so much about you from Miss Tuppence\"--he smiled\\ninvoluntarily--\"that it really seems as though I already know you\\nquite well.\"\\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Tommy with his cheerful grin. He scanned\\nthe great lawyer eagerly. Like Tuppence, he felt the magnetism\\nof the other\\'s personality. He was reminded of Mr. Carter. The\\ntwo men, totally unlike so far as physical resemblance went,\\nproduced a similar effect. Beneath the weary manner of the one\\nand the professional reserve of the other, lay the same quality\\nof mind, keen-edged like a rapier.\\nIn the meantime he was conscious of Sir James\\'s close scrutiny.\\nWhen the lawyer dropped his eyes the young man had the feeling\\nthat the other had read him through and through like an open\\nbook. He could not but wonder what the final judgment was, but\\nthere was little chance of learning that. Sir James took in\\neverything, but gave out only what he chose. A proof of that\\noccurred almost at once.\\nImmediately the first greetings were over Julius broke out into a\\nflood of eager questions. How had Sir James managed to track the\\ngirl? Why had he not let them know that he was still working on\\nthe case? And so on.\\nSir James stroked his chin and smiled. At last he said:\\n\"Just so, just so. Well, she\\'s found. And that\\'s the great\\nthing, isn\\'t it? Eh! Come now, that\\'s the great thing?\"\\n\"Sure it is. But just how did you strike her trail? Miss\\nTuppence and I thought you\\'d quit for good and all.\"\\n\"Ah!\" The lawyer shot a lightning glance at him, then resumed\\noperations on his chin. \"You thought that, did you? Did you\\nreally? H\\'m, dear me.\"\\n\"But I guess I can take it we were wrong,\" pursued Julius.\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know that I should go so far as to say that. But\\nit\\'s certainly fortunate for all parties that we\\'ve managed to\\nfind the young lady.\"\\n\"But where is she?\" demanded Julius, his thoughts flying off on\\nanother tack. \"I thought you\\'d be sure to bring her along?\"\\n\"That would hardly be possible,\" said Sir James gravely.\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Because the young lady was knocked down in a street accident,\\nand has sustained slight injuries to the head. She was taken to\\nthe infirmary, and on recovering consciousness gave her name as\\nJane Finn. When--ah!--I heard that, I arranged for her to be\\nremoved to the house of a doctor--a friend of mine, and wired at\\nonce for you. She relapsed into unconsciousness and has not\\nspoken since.\"\\n\"She\\'s not seriously hurt?\"\\n\"Oh, a bruise and a cut or two; really, from a medical point of\\nview, absurdly slight injuries to have produced such a condition.\\nHer state is probably to be attributed to the mental shock\\nconsequent on recovering her memory.\"\\n\"It\\'s come back?\" cried Julius excitedly.\\nSir James tapped the table rather impatiently.\\n\"Undoubtedly, Mr. Hersheimmer, since she was able to give her\\nreal name. I thought you had appreciated that point.\"\\n\"And you just happened to be on the spot,\" said Tommy. \"Seems\\nquite like a fairy tale.\"\\nBut Sir James was far too wary to be drawn.\\n\"Coincidences are curious things,\" he said dryly.\\nNevertheless Tommy was now certain of what he had before only\\nsuspected. Sir James\\'s presence in Manchester was not accidental.\\nFar from abandoning the case, as Julius supposed, he had by some\\nmeans of his own successfully run the missing girl to earth. The\\nonly thing that puzzled Tommy was the reason for all this\\nsecrecy. He concluded that it was a foible of the legal mind.\\nJulius was speaking.\\n\"After dinner,\" he announced, \"I shall go right away and see\\nJane.\"\\n\"That will be impossible, I fear,\" said Sir James. \"It is very\\nunlikely they would allow her to see visitors at this time of\\nnight. I should suggest to-morrow morning about ten o\\'clock.\"\\nJulius flushed. There was something in Sir James which always\\nstirred him to antagonism. It was a conflict of two masterful\\npersonalities.\\n\"All the same, I reckon I\\'ll go round there to-night and see if I\\ncan\\'t ginger them up to break through their silly rules.\"\\n\"It will be quite useless, Mr. Hersheimmer.\"\\nThe words came out like the crack of a pistol, and Tommy looked\\nup with a start. Julius was nervous and excited. The hand with\\nwhich he raised his glass to his lips shook slightly, but his\\neyes held Sir James\\'s defiantly. For a moment the hostility\\nbetween the two seemed likely to burst into flame, but in the end\\nJulius lowered his eyes, defeated.\\n\"For the moment, I reckon you\\'re the boss.\"\\n\"Thank you,\" said the other. \"We will say ten o\\'clock then?\"\\nWith consummate ease of manner he turned to Tommy. \"I must\\nconfess, Mr. Beresford, that it was something of a surprise to me\\nto see you here this evening. The last I heard of you was that\\nyour friends were in grave anxiety on your behalf. Nothing had\\nbeen heard of you for some days, and Miss Tuppence was inclined\\nto think you had got into difficulties.\"\\n\"I had, sir!\" Tommy grinned reminiscently. \"I was never in a\\ntighter place in my life.\"\\nHelped out by questions from Sir James, he gave an abbreviated\\naccount of his adventures. The lawyer looked at him with renewed\\ninterest as he brought the tale to a close.\\n\"You got yourself out of a tight place very well,\" he said\\ngravely. \"I congratulate you. You displayed a great deal of\\ningenuity and carried your part through well.\"\\nTommy blushed, his face assuming a prawnlike hue at the praise.\\n\"I couldn\\'t have got away but for the girl, sir.\"\\n\"No.\" Sir James smiled a little. \"It was lucky for you she\\nhappened to--er--take a fancy to you.\" Tommy appeared about to\\nprotest, but Sir James went on. \"There\\'s no doubt about her being\\none of the gang, I suppose?\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid not, sir. I thought perhaps they were keeping her\\nthere by force, but the way she acted didn\\'t fit in with that.\\nYou see, she went back to them when she could have got away.\"\\nSir James nodded thoughtfully.\\n\"What did she say? Something about wanting to be taken to\\nMarguerite?\"\\n\"Yes, sir. I suppose she meant Mrs. Vandemeyer.\"\\n\"She always signed herself Rita Vandemeyer. All her friends\\nspoke of her as Rita. Still, I suppose the girl must have been\\nin the habit of calling her by her full name. And, at the moment\\nshe was crying out to her, Mrs. Vandemeyer was either dead or\\ndying! Curious! There are one or two points that strike me as\\nbeing obscure--their sudden change of attitude towards yourself,\\nfor instance. By the way, the house was raided, of course?\"\\n\"Yes, sir, but they\\'d all cleared out.\"\\n\"Naturally,\" said Sir James dryly.\\n\"And not a clue left behind.\"\\n\"I wonder----\" The lawyer tapped the table thoughtfully.\\nSomething in his voice made Tommy look up. Would this man\\'s eyes\\nhave seen something where theirs had been blind? He spoke\\nimpulsively:\\n\"I wish you\\'d been there, sir, to go over the house!\"\\n\"I wish I had,\" said Sir James quietly. He sat for a moment in\\nsilence. Then he looked up. \"And since then? What have you been\\ndoing?\"\\nFor a moment, Tommy stared at him. Then it dawned on him that of\\ncourse the lawyer did not know.\\n\"I forgot that you didn\\'t know about Tuppence,\" he said slowly.\\nThe sickening anxiety, forgotten for a while in the excitement of\\nknowing Jane Finn was found at last, swept over him again.\\nThe lawyer laid down his knife and fork sharply.\\n\"Has anything happened to Miss Tuppence?\" His voice was\\nkeen-edged.\\n\"She\\'s disappeared,\" said Julius.\\n\"When?\"\\n\"A week ago.\"\\n\"How?\"\\nSir James\\'s questions fairly shot out. Between them Tommy and\\nJulius gave the history of the last week and their futile search.\\nSir James went at once to the root of the matter.\\n\"A wire signed with your name? They knew enough of you both for\\nthat. They weren\\'t sure of how much you had learnt in that house.\\nTheir kidnapping of Miss Tuppence is the counter-move to your\\nescape. If necessary they could seal your lips with a threat of\\nwhat might happen to her.\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"That\\'s just what I thought, sir.\"\\nSir James looked at him keenly. \"You had worked that out, had\\nyou? Not bad--not at all bad. The curious thing is that they\\ncertainly did not know anything about you when they first held\\nyou prisoner. You are sure that you did not in any way disclose\\nyour identity?\"\\nTommy shook his head.\\n\"That\\'s so,\" said Julius with a nod. \"Therefore I reckon some\\none put them wise--and not earlier than Sunday afternoon.\"\\n\"Yes, but who?\"\\n\"That almighty omniscient Mr. Brown, of course!\"\\nThere was a faint note of derision in the American\\'s voice which\\nmade Sir James look up sharply.\\n\"You don\\'t believe in Mr. Brown, Mr. Hersheimmer?\"\\n\"No, sir, I do not,\" returned the young American with emphasis.\\n\"Not as such, that is to say. I reckon it out that he\\'s a\\nfigurehead--just a bogy name to frighten the children with. The\\nreal head of this business is that Russian chap Kramenin. I\\nguess he\\'s quite capable of running revolutions in three\\ncountries at once if he chose! The man Whittington is probably\\nthe head of the English branch.\"\\n\"I disagree with you,\" said Sir James shortly. \"Mr. Brown\\nexists.\" He turned to Tommy. \"Did you happen to notice where\\nthat wire was handed in?\"\\n\"No, sir, I\\'m afraid I didn\\'t.\"\\n\"H\\'m. Got it with you?\"\\n\"It\\'s upstairs, sir, in my kit.\"\\n\"I\\'d like to have a look at it sometime. No hurry. You\\'ve\\nwasted a week\"--Tommy hung his head--\"a day or so more is\\nimmaterial. We\\'ll deal with Miss Jane Finn first. Afterwards,\\nwe\\'ll set to work to rescue Miss Tuppence from bondage. I don\\'t\\nthink she\\'s in any immediate danger. That is, so long as they\\ndon\\'t know that we\\'ve got Jane Finn, and that her memory has\\nreturned. We must keep that dark at all costs. You understand?\"\\nThe other two assented, and, after making arrangements for\\nmeeting on the morrow, the great lawyer took his leave.\\nAt ten o\\'clock, the two young men were at the appointed spot. Sir\\nJames had joined them on the doorstep. He alone appeared\\nunexcited. He introduced them to the doctor.\\n\"Mr. Hersheimmer--Mr. Beresford--Dr. Roylance. How\\'s the\\npatient?\"\\n\"Going on well. Evidently no idea of the flight of time. Asked\\nthis morning how many had been saved from the Lusitania. Was it\\nin the papers yet? That, of course, was only what was to be\\nexpected. She seems to have something on her mind, though.\"\\n\"I think we can relieve her anxiety. May we go up?\"\\n\"Certainly.\"\\nTommy\\'s heart beat sensibly faster as they followed the doctor\\nupstairs. Jane Finn at last! The long-sought, the mysterious,\\nthe elusive Jane Finn! How wildly improbable success had seemed!\\nAnd here in this house, her memory almost miraculously restored,\\nlay the girl who held the future of England in her hands. A half\\ngroan broke from Tommy\\'s lips. If only Tuppence could have been\\nat his side to share in the triumphant conclusion of their joint\\nventure! Then he put the thought of Tuppence resolutely aside.\\nHis confidence in Sir James was growing. There was a man who\\nwould unerringly ferret out Tuppence\\'s whereabouts. In the\\nmeantime Jane Finn! And suddenly a dread clutched at his heart.\\nIt seemed too easy.... Suppose they should find her dead ...\\nstricken down by the hand of Mr. Brown?\\nIn another minute he was laughing at these melodramatic fancies.\\nThe doctor held open the door of a room and they passed in. On\\nthe white bed, bandages round her head, lay the girl. Somehow the\\nwhole scene seemed unreal. It was so exactly what one expected\\nthat it gave the effect of being beautifully staged.\\nThe girl looked from one to the other of them with large\\nwondering eyes. Sir James spoke first.\\n\"Miss Finn,\" he said, \"this is your cousin, Mr. Julius P.\\nHersheimmer.\"\\nA faint flush flitted over the girl\\'s face, as Julius stepped\\nforward and took her hand.\\n\"How do, Cousin Jane?\" he said lightly.\\nBut Tommy caught the tremor in his voice.\\n\"Are you really Uncle Hiram\\'s son?\" she asked wonderingly.\\nHer voice, with the slight warmth of the Western accent, had an\\nalmost thrilling quality. It seemed vaguely familiar to Tommy,\\nbut he thrust the impression aside as impossible.\\n\"Sure thing.\"\\n\"We used to read about Uncle Hiram in the papers,\" continued the\\ngirl, in her low soft tones. \"But I never thought I\\'d meet you\\none day. Mother figured it out that Uncle Hiram would never get\\nover being mad with her.\"\\n\"The old man was like that,\" admitted Julius. \"But I guess the\\nnew generation\\'s sort of different. Got no use for the family\\nfeud business. First thing I thought about, soon as the war was\\nover, was to come along and hunt you up.\"\\nA shadow passed over the girl\\'s face.\\n\"They\\'ve been telling me things--dreadful things--that my memory\\nwent, and that there are years I shall never know about--years\\nlost out of my life.\"\\n\"You didn\\'t realize that yourself?\"\\nThe girl\\'s eyes opened wide.\\n\"Why, no. It seems to me as though it were no time since we were\\nbeing hustled into those boats. I can see it all now.\" She\\nclosed her eyes with a shudder.\\nJulius looked across at Sir James, who nodded.\\n\"Don\\'t worry any. It isn\\'t worth it. Now, see here, Jane,\\nthere\\'s something we want to know about. There was a man aboard\\nthat boat with some mighty important papers on him, and the big\\nguns in this country have got a notion that he passed on the\\ngoods to you. Is that so?\"\\nThe girl hesitated, her glance shifting to the other two. Julius\\nunderstood.\\n\"Mr. Beresford is commissioned by the British Government to get\\nthose papers back. Sir James Peel Edgerton is an English Member\\nof Parliament, and might be a big gun in the Cabinet if he liked.\\nIt\\'s owing to him that we\\'ve ferreted you out at last. So you can\\ngo right ahead and tell us the whole story. Did Danvers give you\\nthe papers?\"\\n\"Yes. He said they\\'d have a better chance with me, because they\\nwould save the women and children first.\"\\n\"Just as we thought,\" said Sir James.\\n\"He said they were very important--that they might make all the\\ndifference to the Allies. But, if it\\'s all so long ago, and the\\nwar\\'s over, what does it matter now?\"\\n\"I guess history repeats itself, Jane. First there was a great\\nhue and cry over those papers, then it all died down, and now the\\nwhole caboodle\\'s started all over again--for rather different\\nreasons. Then you can hand them over to us right away?\"\\n\"But I can\\'t.\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"I haven\\'t got them.\"\\n\"You--haven\\'t--got them?\" Julius punctuated the words with\\nlittle pauses.\\n\"No--I hid them.\"\\n\"You hid them?\"\\n\"Yes. I got uneasy. People seemed to be watching me. It scared\\nme--badly.\" She put her hand to her head. \"It\\'s almost the last\\nthing I remember before waking up in the hospital....\"\\n\"Go on,\" said Sir James, in his quiet penetrating tones. \"What do\\nyou remember?\"\\nShe turned to him obediently.\\n\"It was at Holyhead. I came that way--I don\\'t remember why....\"\\n\"That doesn\\'t matter. Go on.\"\\n\"In the confusion on the quay I slipped away. Nobody saw me. I\\ntook a car. Told the man to drive me out of the town. I watched\\nwhen we got on the open road. No other car was following us. I\\nsaw a path at the side of the road. I told the man to wait.\"\\nShe paused, then went on. \"The path led to the cliff, and down\\nto the sea between big yellow gorse bushes--they were like golden\\nflames. I looked round. There wasn\\'t a soul in sight. But just\\nlevel with my head there was a hole in the rock. It was quite\\nsmall--I could only just get my hand in, but it went a long way\\nback. I took the oilskin packet from round my neck and shoved it\\nright in as far as I could. Then I tore off a bit of gorse--My!\\nbut it did prick--and plugged the hole with it so that you\\'d\\nnever guess there was a crevice of any kind there. Then I marked\\nthe place carefully in my own mind, so that I\\'d find it again.\\nThere was a queer boulder in the path just there--for all the\\nworld like a dog sitting up begging. Then I went back to the\\nroad. The car was waiting, and I drove back. I just caught the\\ntrain. I was a bit ashamed of myself for fancying things maybe,\\nbut, by and by, I saw the man opposite me wink at a woman who was\\nsitting next to me, and I felt scared again, and was glad the\\npapers were safe. I went out in the corridor to get a little air.\\nI thought I\\'d slip into another carriage. But the woman called\\nme back, said I\\'d dropped something, and when I stooped to look,\\nsomething seemed to hit me--here.\" She placed her hand to the\\nback of her head. \"I don\\'t remember anything more until I woke up\\nin the hospital.\"\\nThere was a pause.\\n\"Thank you, Miss Finn.\" It was Sir James who spoke. \"I hope we\\nhave not tired you?\"\\n\"Oh, that\\'s all right. My head aches a little, but otherwise I\\nfeel fine.\"\\nJulius stepped forward and took her hand again.\\n\"So long, Cousin Jane. I\\'m going to get busy after those papers,\\nbut I\\'ll be back in two shakes of a dog\\'s tail, and I\\'ll tote you\\nup to London and give you the time of your young life before we\\ngo back to the States! I mean it--so hurry up and get well.\"\\nCHAPTER XX\\nTOO LATE\\nIN the street they held an informal council of war. Sir James had\\ndrawn a watch from his pocket. \"The boat train to Holyhead stops\\nat Chester at 12.14. If you start at once I think you can catch\\nthe connection.\"\\nTommy looked up, puzzled.\\n\"Is there any need to hurry, sir? To-day is only the 24th.\"\\n\"I guess it\\'s always well to get up early in the morning,\" said\\nJulius, before the lawyer had time to reply. \"We\\'ll make tracks\\nfor the depot right away.\"\\nA little frown had settled on Sir James\\'s brow.\\n\"I wish I could come with you. I am due to speak at a meeting at\\ntwo o\\'clock. It is unfortunate.\"\\nThe reluctance in his tone was very evident. It was clear, on\\nthe other hand, that Julius was easily disposed to put up with\\nthe loss of the other\\'s company.\\n\"I guess there\\'s nothing complicated about this deal,\" he\\nremarked. \"Just a game of hide-and-seek, that\\'s all.\"\\n\"I hope so,\" said Sir James.\\n\"Sure thing. What else could it be?\"\\n\"You are still young, Mr. Hersheimmer. At my age you will\\nprobably have learnt one lesson. \\'Never underestimate your\\nadversary.\\' \"\\nThe gravity of his tone impressed Tommy, but had little effect\\nupon Julius.\\n\"You think Mr. Brown might come along and take a hand? If he\\ndoes, I\\'m ready for him.\" He slapped his pocket. \"I carry a gun.\\nLittle Willie here travels round with me everywhere.\" He\\nproduced a murderous-looking automatic, and tapped it\\naffectionately before returning it to its home. \"But he won\\'t be\\nneeded this trip. There\\'s nobody to put Mr. Brown wise.\"\\nThe lawyer shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"There was nobody to put Mr. Brown wise to the fact that Mrs.\\nVandemeyer meant to betray him. Nevertheless, MRS. VANDEMEYER\\nDIED WITHOUT SPEAKING.\"\\nJulius was silenced for once, and Sir James added on a lighter\\nnote:\\n\"I only want to put you on your guard. Good-bye, and good luck.\\nTake no unnecessary risks once the papers are in your hands. If\\nthere is any reason to believe that you have been shadowed,\\ndestroy them at once. Good luck to you. The game is in your\\nhands now.\" He shook hands with them both.\\nTen minutes later the two young men were seated in a first-class\\ncarriage en route for Chester.\\nFor a long time neither of them spoke. When at length Julius\\nbroke the silence, it was with a totally unexpected remark.\\n\"Say,\" he observed thoughtfully, \"did you ever make a darned fool\\nof yourself over a girl\\'s face?\"\\nTommy, after a moment\\'s astonishment, searched his mind.\\n\"Can\\'t say I have,\" he replied at last. \"Not that I can\\nrecollect, anyhow. Why?\"\\n\"Because for the last two months I\\'ve been making a sentimental\\nidiot of myself over Jane! First moment I clapped eyes on her\\nphotograph my heart did all the usual stunts you read about in\\nnovels. I guess I\\'m ashamed to admit it, but I came over here\\ndetermined to find her and fix it all up, and take her back as\\nMrs. Julius P. Hersheimmer!\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tommy, amazed.\\nJulius uncrossed his legs brusquely and continued:\\n\"Just shows what an almighty fool a man can make of himself! One\\nlook at the girl in the flesh, and I was cured!\"\\nFeeling more tongue-tied than ever, Tommy ejaculated \"Oh!\" again.\\n\"No disparagement to Jane, mind you,\" continued the other. \"She\\'s\\na real nice girl, and some fellow will fall in love with her\\nright away.\"\\n\"I thought her a very good-looking girl,\" said Tommy, finding his\\ntongue.\\n\"Sure she is. But she\\'s not like her photo one bit. At least I\\nsuppose she is in a way--must be--because I recognized her right\\noff. If I\\'d seen her in a crowd I\\'d have said \\'There\\'s a girl\\nwhose face I know\\' right away without any hesitation. But there\\nwas something about that photo\"--Julius shook his head, and\\nheaved a sigh--\"I guess romance is a mighty queer thing!\"\\n\"It must be,\" said Tommy coldly, \"if you can come over here in\\nlove with one girl, and propose to another within a fortnight.\"\\nJulius had the grace to look discomposed.\\n\"Well, you see, I\\'d got a sort of tired feeling that I\\'d never\\nfind Jane--and that it was all plumb foolishness anyway. And\\nthen--oh, well, the French, for instance, are much more sensible\\nin the way they look at things. They keep romance and marriage\\napart----\"\\nTommy flushed.\\n\"Well, I\\'m damned! If that\\'s----\"\\nJulius hastened to interrupt.\\n\"Say now, don\\'t be hasty. I don\\'t mean what you mean. I take it\\nAmericans have a higher opinion of morality than you have even.\\nWhat I meant was that the French set about marriage in a\\nbusinesslike way--find two people who are suited to one another,\\nlook after the money affairs, and see the whole thing\\npractically, and in a businesslike spirit.\"\\n\"If you ask me,\" said Tommy, \"we\\'re all too damned businesslike\\nnowadays. We\\'re always saying, \\'Will it pay?\\' The men are bad\\nenough, and the girls are worse!\"\\n\"Cool down, son. Don\\'t get so heated.\"\\n\"I feel heated,\" said Tommy.\\nJulius looked at him and judged it wise to say no more.\\nHowever, Tommy had plenty of time to cool down before they\\nreached Holyhead, and the cheerful grin had returned to his\\ncountenance as they alighted at their destination.\\nAfter consultation, and with the aid of a road map, they were\\nfairly well agreed as to direction, so were able to hire a taxi\\nwithout more ado and drive out on the road leading to Treaddur\\nBay. They instructed the man to go slowly, and watched narrowly\\nso as not to miss the path. They came to it not long after\\nleaving the town, and Tommy stopped the car promptly, asked in a\\ncasual tone whether the path led down to the sea, and hearing it\\ndid paid off the man in handsome style.\\nA moment later the taxi was slowly chugging back to Holyhead.\\nTommy and Julius watched it out of sight, and then turned to the\\nnarrow path.\\n\"It\\'s the right one, I suppose?\" asked Tommy doubtfully. \"There\\nmust be simply heaps along here.\"\\n\"Sure it is. Look at the gorse. Remember what Jane said?\"\\nTommy looked at the swelling hedges of golden blossom which\\nbordered the path on either side, and was convinced.\\nThey went down in single file, Julius leading. Twice Tommy\\nturned his head uneasily. Julius looked back.\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know. I\\'ve got the wind up somehow. Keep fancying\\nthere\\'s some one following us.\"\\n\"Can\\'t be,\" said Julius positively. \"We\\'d see him.\"\\nTommy had to admit that this was true. Nevertheless, his sense\\nof uneasiness deepened. In spite of himself he believed in the\\nomniscience of the enemy.\\n\"I rather wish that fellow would come along,\" said Julius. He\\npatted his pocket. \"Little William here is just aching for\\nexercise!\"\\n\"Do you always carry it--him--with you?\" inquired Tommy with\\nburning curiosity.\\n\"Most always. I guess you never know what might turn up.\"\\nTommy kept a respectful silence. He was impressed by little\\nWilliam. It seemed to remove the menace of Mr. Brown farther\\naway.\\nThe path was now running along the side of the cliff, parallel to\\nthe sea. Suddenly Julius came to such an abrupt halt that Tommy\\ncannoned into him.\\n\"What\\'s up?\" he inquired.\\n\"Look there. If that doesn\\'t beat the band!\"\\nTommy looked. Standing out half obstructing the path was a huge\\nboulder which certainly bore a fanciful resemblance to a\\n\"begging\" terrier.\\n\"Well,\" said Tommy, refusing to share Julius\\'s emotion, \"it\\'s\\nwhat we expected to see, isn\\'t it?\"\\nJulius looked at him sadly and shook his head.\\n\"British phlegm! Sure we expected it--but it kind of rattles me,\\nall the same, to see it sitting there just where we expected to\\nfind it!\"\\nTommy, whose calm was, perhaps, more assumed than natural, moved\\nhis feet impatiently.\\n\"Push on. What about the hole?\"\\nThey scanned the cliff-side narrowly. Tommy heard himself saying\\nidiotically:\\n\"The gorse won\\'t be there after all these years.\"\\nAnd Julius replied solemnly:\\n\"I guess you\\'re right.\"\\nTommy suddenly pointed with a shaking hand.\\n\"What about that crevice there?\"\\nJulius replied in an awestricken voice:\\n\"That\\'s it--for sure.\"\\nThey looked at each other.\\n\"When I was in France,\" said Tommy reminiscently, \"whenever my\\nbatman failed to call me, he always said that he had come over\\nqueer. I never believed it. But whether he felt it or not,\\nthere IS such a sensation. I\\'ve got it now! Badly!\"\\nHe looked at the rock with a kind of agonized passion.\\n\"Damn it!\" he cried. \"It\\'s impossible! Five years! Think of\\nit! Bird\\'s-nesting boys, picnic parties, thousands of people\\npassing! It can\\'t be there! It\\'s a hundred to one against its\\nbeing there! It\\'s against all reason!\"\\nIndeed, he felt it to be impossible--more, perhaps, because he\\ncould not believe in his own success where so many others had\\nfailed. The thing was too easy, therefore it could not be. The\\nhole would be empty.\\nJulius looked at him with a widening smile.\\n\"I guess you\\'re rattled now all right,\" he drawled with some\\nenjoyment. \"Well, here goes!\" He thrust his hand into the\\ncrevice, and made a slight grimace. \"It\\'s a tight fit. Jane\\'s\\nhand must be a few sizes smaller than mine. I don\\'t feel\\nanything--no--say, what\\'s this? Gee whiz!\" And with a flourish\\nhe waved aloft a small discoloured packet. \"It\\'s the goods all\\nright. Sewn up in oilskin. Hold it while I get my penknife.\"\\nThe unbelievable had happened. Tommy held the precious packet\\ntenderly between his hands. They had succeeded!\\n\"It\\'s queer,\" he murmured idly, \"you\\'d think the stitches would\\nhave rotted. They look just as good as new.\"\\nThey cut them carefully and ripped away the oilskin. Inside was\\na small folded sheet of paper. With trembling fingers they\\nunfolded it. The sheet was blank! They stared at each other,\\npuzzled.\\n\"A dummy?\" hazarded Julius. \"Was Danvers just a decoy?\"\\nTommy shook his head. That solution did not satisfy him.\\nSuddenly his face cleared.\\n\"I\\'ve got it! SYMPATHETIC INK!\"\\n\"You think so?\"\\n\"Worth trying anyhow. Heat usually does the trick. Get some\\nsticks. We\\'ll make a fire.\"\\nIn a few minutes the little fire of twigs and leaves was blazing\\nmerrily. Tommy held the sheet of paper near the glow. The paper\\ncurled a little with the heat. Nothing more.\\nSuddenly Julius grasped his arm, and pointed to where characters\\nwere appearing in a faint brown colour.\\n\"Gee whiz! You\\'ve got it! Say, that idea of yours was great. It\\nnever occurred to me.\"\\nTommy held the paper in position some minutes longer until he\\njudged the heat had done its work. Then he withdrew it. A moment\\nlater he uttered a cry.\\nAcross the sheet in neat brown printing ran the words: WITH THE\\nCOMPLIMENTS OF MR. BROWN.\\nCHAPTER XXI\\nTOMMY MAKES A DISCOVERY\\nFOR a moment or two they stood staring at each other stupidly,\\ndazed with the shock. Somehow, inexplicably, Mr. Brown had\\nforestalled them. Tommy accepted defeat quietly. Not so Julius.\\n\"How in tarnation did he get ahead of us? That\\'s what beats me!\"\\nhe ended up.\\nTommy shook his head, and said dully:\\n\"It accounts for the stitches being new. We might have\\nguessed....\"\\n\"Never mind the darned stitches. How did he get ahead of us? We\\nhustled all we knew. It\\'s downright impossible for anyone to get\\nhere quicker than we did. And, anyway, how did he know? Do you\\nreckon there was a dictaphone in Jane\\'s room? I guess there must\\nhave been.\"\\nBut Tommy\\'s common sense pointed out objections.\\n\"No one could have known beforehand that she was going to be in\\nthat house--much less that particular room.\"\\n\"That\\'s so,\" admitted Julius. \"Then one of the nurses was a\\ncrook and listened at the door. How\\'s that?\"\\n\"I don\\'t see that it matters anyway,\" said Tommy wearily. \"He may\\nhave found out some months ago, and removed the papers,\\nthen----No, by Jove, that won\\'t wash! They\\'d have been published\\nat once.\"\\n\"Sure thing they would! No, some one\\'s got ahead of us to-day by\\nan hour or so. But how they did it gets my goat.\"\\n\"I wish that chap Peel Edgerton had been with us,\" said Tommy\\nthoughtfully.\\n\"Why?\" Julius stared. \"The mischief was done when we came.\"\\n\"Yes----\" Tommy hesitated. He could not explain his own\\nfeeling--the illogical idea that the K.C.\\'s presence would\\nsomehow have averted the catastrophe. He reverted to his former\\npoint of view. \"It\\'s no good arguing about how it was done. The\\ngame\\'s up. We\\'ve failed. There\\'s only one thing for me to do.\"\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\n\"Get back to London as soon as possible. Mr. Carter must be\\nwarned. It\\'s only a matter of hours now before the blow falls.\\nBut, at any rate, he ought to know the worst.\"\\nThe duty was an unpleasant one, but Tommy had no intention of\\nshirking it. He must report his failure to Mr. Carter. After\\nthat his work was done. He took the midnight mail to London.\\nJulius elected to stay the night at Holyhead.\\nHalf an hour after arrival, haggard and pale, Tommy stood before\\nhis chief.\\n\"I\\'ve come to report, sir. I\\'ve failed--failed badly.\"\\nMr. Carter eyed him sharply.\\n\"You mean that the treaty----\"\\n\"Is in the hands of Mr. Brown, sir.\"\\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Carter quietly. The expression on his face did\\nnot change, but Tommy caught the flicker of despair in his eyes.\\nIt convinced him as nothing else had done that the outlook was\\nhopeless.\\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Carter after a minute or two, \"we mustn\\'t sag at\\nthe knees, I suppose. I\\'m glad to know definitely. We must do\\nwhat we can.\"\\nThrough Tommy\\'s mind flashed the assurance: \"It\\'s hopeless, and\\nhe knows it\\'s hopeless!\"\\nThe other looked up at him.\\n\"Don\\'t take it to heart, lad,\" he said kindly. \"You did your\\nbest. You were up against one of the biggest brains of the\\ncentury. And you came very near success. Remember that.\"\\n\"Thank you, sir. It\\'s awfully decent of you.\"\\n\"I blame myself. I have been blaming myself ever since I heard\\nthis other news.\"\\nSomething in his tone attracted Tommy\\'s attention. A new fear\\ngripped at his heart.\\n\"Is there--something more, sir?\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid so,\" said Mr. Carter gravely. He stretched out his\\nhand to a sheet on the table.\\n\"Tuppence----?\" faltered Tommy.\\n\"Read for yourself.\"\\nThe typewritten words danced before his eyes. The description of\\na green toque, a coat with a handkerchief in the pocket marked\\nP.L.C. He looked an agonized question at Mr. Carter. The latter\\nreplied to it:\\n\"Washed up on the Yorkshire coast--near Ebury. I\\'m afraid--it\\nlooks very much like foul play.\"\\n\"My God!\" gasped Tommy. \"TUPPENCE! Those devils--I\\'ll never\\nrest till I\\'ve got even with them! I\\'ll hunt them down!\\nI\\'ll----\"\\nThe pity on Mr. Carter\\'s face stopped him.\\n\"I know what you feel like, my poor boy. But it\\'s no good.\\nYou\\'ll waste your strength uselessly. It may sound harsh, but my\\nadvice to you is: Cut your losses. Time\\'s merciful. You\\'ll\\nforget.\"\\n\"Forget Tuppence? Never!\"\\nMr. Carter shook his head.\\n\"So you think now. Well, it won\\'t bear thinking of--that brave\\nlittle girl! I\\'m sorry about the whole business--confoundedly\\nsorry.\"\\nTommy came to himself with a start.\\n\"I\\'m taking up your time, sir,\" he said with an effort. \"There\\'s\\nno need for you to blame yourself. I dare say we were a couple\\nof young fools to take on such a job. You warned us all right.\\nBut I wish to God I\\'d been the one to get it in the neck.\\nGood-bye, sir.\"\\nBack at the Ritz, Tommy packed up his few belongings\\nmechanically, his thoughts far away. He was still bewildered by\\nthe introduction of tragedy into his cheerful commonplace\\nexistence. What fun they had had together, he and Tuppence! And\\nnow--oh, he couldn\\'t believe it--it couldn\\'t be true!\\nTUPPENCE--DEAD! Little Tuppence, brimming over with life! It was\\na dream, a horrible dream. Nothing more.\\nThey brought him a note, a few kind words of sympathy from Peel\\nEdgerton, who had read the news in the paper. (There had been a\\nlarge headline: EX-V.A.D. FEARED DROWNED.) The letter ended with\\nthe offer of a post on a ranch in the Argentine, where Sir James\\nhad considerable interests.\\n\"Kind old beggar,\" muttered Tommy, as he flung it aside.\\nThe door opened, and Julius burst in with his usual violence. He\\nheld an open newspaper in his hand.\\n\"Say, what\\'s all this? They seem to have got some fool idea\\nabout Tuppence.\"\\n\"It\\'s true,\" said Tommy quietly.\\n\"You mean they\\'ve done her in?\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"I suppose when they got the treaty she--wasn\\'t any good to them\\nany longer, and they were afraid to let her go.\"\\n\"Well, I\\'m darned!\" said Julius. \"Little Tuppence. She sure was\\nthe pluckiest little girl----\"\\nBut suddenly something seemed to crack in Tommy\\'s brain. He rose\\nto his feet.\\n\"Oh, get out! You don\\'t really care, damn you! You asked her to\\nmarry you in your rotten cold-blooded way, but I LOVED her. I\\'d\\nhave given the soul out of my body to save her from harm. I\\'d\\nhave stood by without a word and let her marry you, because you\\ncould have given her the sort of time she ought to have had, and\\nI was only a poor devil without a penny to bless himself with.\\nBut it wouldn\\'t have been because I didn\\'t care!\"\\n\"See here,\" began Julius temperately.\\n\"Oh, go to the devil! I can\\'t stand your coming here and talking\\nabout \\'little Tuppence.\\' Go and look after your cousin.\\nTuppence is my girl! I\\'ve always loved her, from the time we\\nplayed together as kids. We grew up and it was just the same. I\\nshall never forget when I was in hospital, and she came in in\\nthat ridiculous cap and apron! It was like a miracle to see the\\ngirl I loved turn up in a nurse\\'s kit----\"\\nBut Julius interrupted him.\\n\"A nurse\\'s kit! Gee whiz! I must be going to Colney Hatch! I\\ncould swear I\\'ve seen Jane in a nurse\\'s cap too. And that\\'s\\nplumb impossible! No, by gum, I\\'ve got it! It was her I saw\\ntalking to Whittington at that nursing home in Bournemouth. She\\nwasn\\'t a patient there! She was a nurse!\"\\n\"I dare say,\" said Tommy angrily, \"she\\'s probably been in with\\nthem from the start. I shouldn\\'t wonder if she stole those\\npapers from Danvers to begin with.\"\\n\"I\\'m darned if she did!\" shouted Julius. \"She\\'s my cousin, and\\nas patriotic a girl as ever stepped.\"\\n\"I don\\'t care a damn what she is, but get out of here!\" retorted\\nTommy also at the top of his voice.\\nThe young men were on the point of coming to blows. But\\nsuddenly, with an almost magical abruptness, Julius\\'s anger\\nabated.\\n\"All right, son,\" he said quietly, \"I\\'m going. I don\\'t blame you\\nany for what you\\'ve been saying. It\\'s mighty lucky you did say\\nit. I\\'ve been the most almighty blithering darned idiot that\\nit\\'s possible to imagine. Calm down\"--Tommy had made an impatient\\ngesture--\"I\\'m going right away now--going to the London and North\\nWestern Railway depot, if you want to know.\"\\n\"I don\\'t care a damn where you\\'re going,\" growled Tommy.\\nAs the door closed behind Julius, he returned to his suit-case.\\n\"That\\'s the lot,\" he murmured, and rang the bell.\\n\"Take my luggage down.\"\\n\"Yes, sir. Going away, sir?\"\\n\"I\\'m going to the devil,\" said Tommy, regardless of the menial\\'s\\nfeelings.\\nThat functionary, however, merely replied respectfully:\\n\"Yes, sir. Shall I call a taxi?\"\\nTommy nodded.\\nWhere was he going? He hadn\\'t the faintest idea. Beyond a fixed\\ndetermination to get even with Mr. Brown he had no plans. He\\nre-read Sir James\\'s letter, and shook his head. Tuppence must be\\navenged. Still, it was kind of the old fellow.\\n\"Better answer it, I suppose.\" He went across to the\\nwriting-table. With the usual perversity of bedroom stationery,\\nthere were innumerable envelopes and no paper. He rang. No one\\ncame. Tommy fumed at the delay. Then he remembered that there\\nwas a good supply in Julius\\'s sitting-room. The American had\\nannounced his immediate departure, there would be no fear of\\nrunning up against him. Besides, he wouldn\\'t mind if he did. He\\nwas beginning to be rather ashamed of the things he had said. Old\\nJulius had taken them jolly well. He\\'d apologize if he found him\\nthere.\\nBut the room was deserted. Tommy walked across to the\\nwriting-table, and opened the middle drawer. A photograph,\\ncarelessly thrust in face upwards, caught his eye. For a moment\\nhe stood rooted to the ground. Then he took it out, shut the\\ndrawer, walked slowly over to an arm-chair, and sat down still\\nstaring at the photograph in his hand.\\nWhat on earth was a photograph of the French girl Annette doing\\nin Julius Hersheimmer\\'s writing-table?\\nCHAPTER XXII\\nIN DOWNING STREET\\nTHE Prime Minister tapped the desk in front of him with nervous\\nfingers. His face was worn and harassed. He took up his\\nconversation with Mr. Carter at the point it had broken off. \"I\\ndon\\'t understand,\" he said. \"Do you really mean that things are\\nnot so desperate after all?\"\\n\"So this lad seems to think.\"\\n\"Let\\'s have a look at his letter again.\"\\nMr. Carter handed it over. It was written in a sprawling boyish\\nhand.\\n\"DEAR MR. CARTER,\\n\"Something\\'s turned up that has given me a jar. Of course I may\\nbe simply making an awful ass of myself, but I don\\'t think so. If\\nmy conclusions are right, that girl at Manchester was just a\\nplant. The whole thing was prearranged, sham packet and all, with\\nthe object of making us think the game was up--therefore I fancy\\nthat we must have been pretty hot on the scent.\\n\"I think I know who the real Jane Finn is, and I\\'ve even got an\\nidea where the papers are. That last\\'s only a guess, of course,\\nbut I\\'ve a sort of feeling it\\'ll turn out right. Anyhow, I\\nenclose it in a sealed envelope for what it\\'s worth. I\\'m going to\\nask you not to open it until the very last moment, midnight on\\nthe 28th, in fact. You\\'ll understand why in a minute. You see,\\nI\\'ve figured it out that those things of Tuppence\\'s are a plant\\ntoo, and she\\'s no more drowned than I am. The way I reason is\\nthis: as a last chance they\\'ll let Jane Finn escape in the hope\\nthat she\\'s been shamming this memory stunt, and that once she\\nthinks she\\'s free she\\'ll go right away to the cache. Of course\\nit\\'s an awful risk for them to take, because she knows all about\\nthem--but they\\'re pretty desperate to get hold of that treaty.\\nBUT IF THEY KNOW THAT THE PAPERS HAVE BEEN RECOVERED BY US,\\nneither of those two girls\\' lives will be worth an hour\\'s\\npurchase. I must try and get hold of Tuppence before Jane\\nescapes.\\n\"I want a repeat of that telegram that was sent to Tuppence at\\nthe Ritz. Sir James Peel Edgerton said you would be able to\\nmanage that for me. He\\'s frightfully clever.\\n\"One last thing--please have that house in Soho watched day and\\nnight.\\n\"Yours, etc.,\\n\"THOMAS BERESFORD.\"\\nThe Prime Minister looked up.\\n\"The enclosure?\"\\nMr. Carter smiled dryly.\\n\"In the vaults of the Bank. I am taking no chances.\"\\n\"You don\\'t think\"--the Prime Minister hesitated a minute--\"that\\nit would be better to open it now? Surely we ought to secure the\\ndocument, that is, provided the young man\\'s guess turns out to be\\ncorrect, at once. We can keep the fact of having done so quite\\nsecret.\"\\n\"Can we? I\\'m not so sure. There are spies all round us. Once\\nit\\'s known I wouldn\\'t give that\"--he snapped his fingers--\"for\\nthe life of those two girls. No, the boy trusted me, and I\\nshan\\'t let him down.\"\\n\"Well, well, we must leave it at that, then. What\\'s he like,\\nthis lad?\"\\n\"Outwardly, he\\'s an ordinary clean-limbed, rather block-headed\\nyoung Englishman. Slow in his mental processes. On the other\\nhand, it\\'s quite impossible to lead him astray through his\\nimagination. He hasn\\'t got any--so he\\'s difficult to deceive. He\\nworries things out slowly, and once he\\'s got hold of anything he\\ndoesn\\'t let go. The little lady\\'s quite different. More\\nintuition and less common sense. They make a pretty pair working\\ntogether. Pace and stamina.\"\\n\"He seems confident,\" mused the Prime Minister.\\n\"Yes, and that\\'s what gives me hope. He\\'s the kind of diffident\\nyouth who would have to be VERY sure before he ventured an\\nopinion at all.\"\\nA half smile came to the other\\'s lips.\\n\"And it is this--boy who will defeat the master criminal of our\\ntime?\"\\n\"This--boy, as you say! But I sometimes fancy I see a shadow\\nbehind.\"\\n\"You mean?\"\\n\"Peel Edgerton.\"\\n\"Peel Edgerton?\" said the Prime Minister in astonishment.\\n\"Yes. I see his hand in THIS.\" He struck the open letter. \"He\\'s\\nthere--working in the dark, silently, unobtrusively. I\\'ve always\\nfelt that if anyone was to run Mr. Brown to earth, Peel Edgerton\\nwould be the man. I tell you he\\'s on the case now, but doesn\\'t\\nwant it known. By the way, I got rather an odd request from him\\nthe other day.\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"He sent me a cutting from some American paper. It referred to a\\nman\\'s body found near the docks in New York about three weeks\\nago. He asked me to collect any information on the subject I\\ncould.\"\\n\"Well?\"\\nCarter shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"I couldn\\'t get much. Young fellow about thirty-five--poorly\\ndressed--face very badly disfigured. He was never identified.\"\\n\"And you fancy that the two matters are connected in some way?\"\\n\"Somehow I do. I may be wrong, of course.\"\\nThere was a pause, then Mr. Carter continued:\\n\"I asked him to come round here. Not that we\\'ll get anything out\\nof him he doesn\\'t want to tell. His legal instincts are too\\nstrong. But there\\'s no doubt he can throw light on one or two\\nobscure points in young Beresford\\'s letter. Ah, here he is!\"\\nThe two men rose to greet the new-comer. A half whimsical thought\\nflashed across the Premier\\'s mind. \"My successor, perhaps!\"\\n\"We\\'ve had a letter from young Beresford,\" said Mr. Carter,\\ncoming to the point at once. \"You\\'ve seen him, I suppose?\"\\n\"You suppose wrong,\" said the lawyer.\\n\"Oh!\" Mr. Carter was a little nonplussed.\\nSir James smiled, and stroked his chin.\\n\"He rang me up,\" he volunteered.\\n\"Would you have any objection to telling us exactly what passed\\nbetween you?\"\\n\"Not at all. He thanked me for a certain letter which I had\\nwritten to him--as a matter of fact, I had offered him a job.\\nThen he reminded me of something I had said to him at Manchester\\nrespecting that bogus telegram which lured Miss Cowley away. I\\nasked him if anything untoward had occurred. He said it\\nhad--that in a drawer in Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s room he had discovered\\na photograph.\" The laywer{sic} paused, then continued: \"I asked\\nhim if the photograph bore the name and address of a Californian\\nphotographer. He replied: \\'You\\'re on to it, sir. It had.\\' Then\\nhe went on to tell me something I DIDN\\'T know. The original of\\nthat photograph was the French girl, Annette, who saved his\\nlife.\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"Exactly. I asked the young man with some curiosity what he had\\ndone with the photograph. He replied that he had put it back\\nwhere he found it.\" The lawyer paused again. \"That was good, you\\nknow--distinctly good. He can use his brains, that young fellow.\\nI congratulated him. The discovery was a providential one. Of\\ncourse, from the moment that the girl in Manchester was proved to\\nbe a plant everything was altered. Young Beresford saw that for\\nhimself without my having to tell it him. But he felt he couldn\\'t\\ntrust his judgment on the subject of Miss Cowley. Did I think\\nshe was alive? I told him, duly weighing the evidence, that\\nthere was a very decided chance in favour of it. That brought us\\nback to the telegram.\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"I advised him to apply to you for a copy of the original wire.\\nIt had occurred to me as probable that, after Miss Cowley flung\\nit on the floor, certain words might have been erased and altered\\nwith the express intention of setting searchers on a false\\ntrail.\"\\nCarter nodded. He took a sheet from his pocket, and read aloud:\\n\"Come at once, Astley Priors, Gatehouse, Kent. Great\\ndevelopments--TOMMY.\\n\"Very simple,\" said Sir James, \"and very ingenious. Just a few\\nwords to alter, and the thing was done. And the one important\\nclue they overlooked.\"\\n\"What was that?\"\\n\"The page-boy\\'s statement that Miss Cowley drove to Charing\\nCross. They were so sure of themselves that they took it for\\ngranted he had made a mistake.\"\\n\"Then young Beresford is now?\"\\n\"At Gatehouse, Kent, unless I am much mistaken.\"\\nMr. Carter looked at him curiously.\\n\"I rather wonder you\\'re not there too, Peel Edgerton?\"\\n\"Ah, I\\'m busy on a case.\"\\n\"I thought you were on your holiday?\"\\n\"Oh, I\\'ve not been briefed. Perhaps it would be more correct to\\nsay I\\'m preparing a case. Any more facts about that American\\nchap for me?\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid not. Is it important to find out who he was?\"\\n\"Oh, I know who he was,\" said Sir James easily. \"I can\\'t prove\\nit yet--but I know.\"\\nThe other two asked no questions. They had an instinct that it\\nwould be mere waste of breath.\\n\"But what I don\\'t understand,\" said the Prime-Minister suddenly,\\n\"is how that photograph came to be in Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s drawer?\"\\n\"Perhaps it never left it,\" suggested the lawyer gently.\\n\"But the bogus inspector? Inspector Brown?\"\\n\"Ah!\" said Sir James thoughtfully. He rose to his feet. \"I\\nmustn\\'t keep you. Go on with the affairs of the nation. I must\\nget back to--my case.\"\\nTwo days later Julius Hersheimmer returned from Manchester. A\\nnote from Tommy lay on his table:\\n\"DEAR HERSHEIMMER,\\n\"Sorry I lost my temper. In case I don\\'t see you again,\\ngood-bye. I\\'ve been offered a job in the Argentine, and might as\\nwell take it. \"Yours,\\n\"TOMMY BERESFORD.\"\\nA peculiar smile lingered for a moment on Julius\\'s face. He threw\\nthe letter into the waste-paper basket.\\n\"The darned fool!\" he murmured.\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\nA RACE AGAINST TIME\\nAFTER ringing up Sir James, Tommy\\'s next procedure was to make a\\ncall at South Audley Mansions. He found Albert discharging his\\nprofessional duties, and introduced himself without more ado as a\\nfriend of Tuppence\\'s. Albert unbent immediately.\\n\"Things has been very quiet here lately,\" he said wistfully.\\n\"Hope the young lady\\'s keeping well, sir?\"\\n\"That\\'s just the point, Albert. She\\'s disappeared.\" You don\\'t\\nmean as the crooks have got her?\"\\n\"In the Underworld?\"\\n\"No, dash it all, in this world!\"\\n\"It\\'s a h\\'expression, sir,\" explained Albert. \"At the pictures\\nthe crooks always have a restoorant in the Underworld. But do\\nyou think as they\\'ve done her in, sir?\"\\n\"I hope not. By the way, have you by any chance an aunt, a\\ncousin, a grandmother, or any other suitable female relation who\\nmight be represented as being likely to kick the bucket?\"\\nA delighted grin spread slowly over Albert\\'s countenance.\\n\"I\\'m on, sir. My poor aunt what lives in the country has been\\nmortal bad for a long time, and she\\'s asking for me with her\\ndying breath.\"\\nTommy nodded approval.\\n\"Can you report this in the proper quarter and meet me at Charing\\nCross in an hour\\'s time?\"\\n\"I\\'ll be there, sir. You can count on me.\"\\nAs Tommy had judged, the faithful Albert proved an invaluable\\nally. The two took up their quarters at the inn in Gatehouse. To\\nAlbert fell the task of collecting information There was no\\ndifficulty about it.\\nAstley Priors was the property of a Dr. Adams. The doctor no\\nlonger practiced, had retired, the landlord believed, but he took\\na few private patients--here the good fellow tapped his forehead\\nknowingly--\"balmy ones! You understand!\" The doctor was a\\npopular figure in the village, subscribed freely to all the local\\nsports--\"a very pleasant, affable gentleman.\" Been there long?\\nOh, a matter of ten years or so--might be longer. Scientific\\ngentleman, he was. Professors and people often came down from\\ntown to see him. Anyway, it was a gay house, always visitors.\\nIn the face of all this volubility, Tommy felt doubts. Was it\\npossible that this genial, well-known figure could be in reality\\na dangerous criminal? His life seemed so open and aboveboard. No\\nhint of sinister doings. Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake?\\nTommy felt a cold chill at the thought.\\nThen he remembered the private patients--\"balmy ones.\" He\\ninquired carefully if there was a young lady amongst them,\\ndescribing Tuppence. But nothing much seemed to be known about\\nthe patients--they were seldom seen outside the grounds. A\\nguarded description of Annette also failed to provoke\\nrecognition.\\nAstley Priors was a pleasant red-brick edifice, surrounded by\\nwell-wooded grounds which effectually shielded the house from\\nobservation from the road.\\nOn the first evening Tommy, accompanied by Albert, explored the\\ngrounds. Owing to Albert\\'s insistence they dragged themselves\\nalong painfully on their stomachs, thereby producing a great deal\\nmore noise than if they had stood upright. In any case, these\\nprecautions were totally unnecessary. The grounds, like those of\\nany other private house after nightfall, seemed untenanted.\\nTommy had imagined a possible fierce watchdog. Albert\\'s fancy ran\\nto a puma, or a tame cobra. But they reached a shrubbery near\\nthe house quite unmolested.\\nThe blinds of the dining-room window were up. There was a large\\ncompany assembled round the table. The port was passing from\\nhand to hand. It seemed a normal, pleasant company. Through the\\nopen window scraps of conversation floated out disjointedly on\\nthe night air. It was a heated discussion on county cricket!\\nAgain Tommy felt that cold chill of uncertainty. It seemed\\nimpossible to believe that these people were other than they\\nseemed. Had he been fooled once more? The fair-bearded,\\nspectacled gentleman who sat at the head of the table looked\\nsingularly honest and normal.\\nTommy slept badly that night. The following morning the\\nindefatigable Albert, having cemented an alliance with the\\ngreengrocer\\'s boy, took the latter\\'s place and ingratiated\\nhimself with the cook at Malthouse. He returned with the\\ninformation that she was undoubtedly \"one of the crooks,\" but\\nTommy mistrusted the vividness of his imagination. Questioned,\\nhe could adduce nothing in support of his statement except his\\nown opinion that she wasn\\'t the usual kind. You could see that\\nat a glance.\\nThe substitution being repeated (much to the pecuniary advantage\\nof the real greengrocer\\'s boy) on the following day, Albert\\nbrought back the first piece of hopeful news. There WAS a French\\nyoung lady staying in the house. Tommy put his doubts aside.\\nHere was confirmation of his theory. But time pressed. To-day\\nwas the 27th. The 29th was the much-talked-of \"Labour Day,\"\\nabout which all sorts of rumours were running riot. Newspapers\\nwere getting agitated. Sensational hints of a Labour coup d\\'etat\\nwere freely reported. The Government said nothing. It knew and\\nwas prepared. There were rumours of dissension among the Labour\\nleaders. They were not of one mind. The more far-seeing among\\nthem realized that what they proposed might well be a death-blow\\nto the England that at heart they loved. They shrank from the\\nstarvation and misery a general strike would entail, and were\\nwilling to meet the Government half-way. But behind them were\\nsubtle, insistent forces at work, urging the memories of old\\nwrongs, deprecating the weakness of half-and-half measures,\\nfomenting misunderstandings.\\nTommy felt that, thanks to Mr. Carter, he understood the position\\nfairly accurately. With the fatal document in the hands of Mr.\\nBrown, public opinion would swing to the side of the Labour\\nextremists and revolutionists. Failing that, the battle was an\\neven chance. The Government with a loyal army and police force\\nbehind them might win--but at a cost of great suffering. But\\nTommy nourished another and a preposterous dream. With Mr. Brown\\nunmasked and captured he believed, rightly or wrongly, that the\\nwhole organization would crumble ignominiously and\\ninstantaneously. The strange permeating influence of the unseen\\nchief held it together. Without him, Tommy believed an instant\\npanic would set in; and, the honest men left to themselves, an\\neleventh-hour reconciliation would be possible.\\n\"This is a one-man show,\" said Tommy to himself. \"The thing to do\\nis to get hold of the man.\"\\nIt was partly in furtherance of this ambitious design that he had\\nrequested Mr. Carter not to open the sealed envelope. The draft\\ntreaty was Tommy\\'s bait. Every now and then he was aghast at his\\nown presumption. How dared he think that he had discovered what\\nso many wiser and clever men had overlooked? Nevertheless, he\\nstuck tenaciously to his idea.\\nThat evening he and Albert once more penetrated the grounds of\\nAstley Priors. Tommy\\'s ambition was somehow or other to gain\\nadmission to the house itself. As they approached cautiously,\\nTommy gave a sudden gasp.\\nOn the second floor window some one standing between the window\\nand the light in the room threw a silhouette on the blind. It was\\none Tommy would have recognized anywhere! Tuppence was in that\\nhouse!\\nHe clutched Albert by the shoulder.\\n\"Stay here! When I begin to sing, watch that window.\"\\nHe retreated hastily to a position on the main drive, and began\\nin a deep roar, coupled with an unsteady gait, the following\\nditty:\\nI am a Soldier A jolly British Soldier;\\nYou can see that I\\'m a Soldier by my feet . . .\\nIt had been a favourite on the gramophone in Tuppence\\'s hospital\\ndays. He did not doubt but that she would recognize it and draw\\nher own conclusions. Tommy had not a note of music in his voice,\\nbut his lungs were excellent. The noise he produced was terrific.\\nPresently an unimpeachable butler, accompanied by an equally\\nunimpeachable footman, issued from the front door. The butler\\nremonstrated with him. Tommy continued to sing, addressing the\\nbutler affectionately as \"dear old whiskers.\" The footman took\\nhim by one arm, the butler by the other. They ran him down the\\ndrive, and neatly out of the gate. The butler threatened him with\\nthe police if he intruded again. It was beautifully done--soberly\\nand with perfect decorum. Anyone would have sworn that the butler\\nwas a real butler, the footman a real footman--only, as it\\nhappened, the butler was Whittington!\\nTommy retired to the inn and waited for Albert\\'s return. At last\\nthat worthy made his appearance.\\n\"Well?\" cried Tommy eagerly.\\n\"It\\'s all right. While they was a-running of you out the window\\nopened, and something was chucked out.\" He handed a scrap of\\npaper to Tommy. \"It was wrapped round a letterweight.\"\\nOn the paper were scrawled three words: \"To-morrow--same time.\"\\n\"Good egg!\" cried Tommy. \"We\\'re getting going.\"\\n\"I wrote a message on a piece of paper, wrapped it round a stone,\\nand chucked it through the window,\" continued Albert\\nbreathlessly.\\nTommy groaned.\\n\"Your zeal will be the undoing of us, Albert. What did you say?\"\\n\"Said we was a-staying at the inn. If she could get away, to\\ncome there and croak like a frog.\"\\n\"She\\'ll know that\\'s you,\" said Tommy with a sigh of relief. \"Your\\nimagination runs away with you, you know, Albert. Why, you\\nwouldn\\'t recognize a frog croaking if you heard it.\"\\nAlbert looked rather crest-fallen.\\n\"Cheer up,\" said Tommy. \"No harm done. That butler\\'s an old\\nfriend of mine--I bet he knew who I was, though he didn\\'t let on.\\nIt\\'s not their game to show suspicion. That\\'s why we\\'ve found it\\nfairly plain sailing. They don\\'t want to discourage me\\naltogether. On the other hand, they don\\'t want to make it too\\neasy. I\\'m a pawn in their game, Albert, that\\'s what I am. You\\nsee, if the spider lets the fly walk out too easily, the fly\\nmight suspect it was a put-up job. Hence the usefulness of that\\npromising youth, Mr. T. Beresford, who\\'s blundered in just at the\\nright moment for them. But later, Mr. T. Beresford had better\\nlook out!\"\\nTommy retired for the night in a state of some elation. He had\\nelaborated a careful plan for the following evening. He felt sure\\nthat the inhabitants of Astley Priors would not interfere with\\nhim up to a certain point. It was after that that Tommy proposed\\nto give them a surprise.\\nAbout twelve o\\'clock, however, his calm was rudely shaken. He was\\ntold that some one was demanding him in the bar. The applicant\\nproved to be a rude-looking carter well coated with mud.\\n\"Well, my good fellow, what is it?\" asked Tommy.\\n\"Might this be for you, sir?\" The carter held out a very dirty\\nfolded note, on the outside of which was written: \"Take this to\\nthe gentleman at the inn near Astley Priors. He will give you\\nten shillings.\"\\nThe handwriting was Tuppence\\'s. Tommy appreciated her\\nquick-wittedness in realizing that he might be staying at the inn\\nunder an assumed name. He snatched at it.\\n\"That\\'s all right.\"\\nThe man withheld it.\\n\"What about my ten shillings?\"\\nTommy hastily produced a ten-shilling note, and the man\\nrelinquished his find. Tommy unfastened it.\\n\"DEAR TOMMY,\\n\"I knew it was you last night. Don\\'t go this evening. They\\'ll be\\nlying in wait for you. They\\'re taking us away this morning. I\\nheard something about Wales--Holyhead, I think. I\\'ll drop this on\\nthe road if I get a chance. Annette told me how you\\'d escaped.\\nBuck up.\\n\"Yours,\\n\"TWOPENCE.\"\\nTommy raised a shout for Albert before he had even finished\\nperusing this characteristic epistle.\\n\"Pack my bag! We\\'re off!\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\" The boots of Albert could be heard racing upstairs.\\nHolyhead? Did that mean that, after all----Tommy was puzzled. He\\nread on slowly.\\nThe boots of Albert continued to be active on the floor above.\\nSuddenly a second shout came from below.\\n\"Albert! I\\'m a damned fool! Unpack that bag!\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\nTommy smoothed out the note thoughtfully.\\n\"Yes, a damned fool,\" he said softly. \"But so\\'s some one else!\\nAnd at last I know who it is!\"\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\nJULIUS TAKES A HAND\\nIN his suite at Claridge\\'s, Kramenin reclined on a couch and\\ndictated to his secretary in sibilant Russian.\\nPresently the telephone at the secretary\\'s elbow purred, and he\\ntook up the receiver, spoke for a minute or two, then turned to\\nhis employer.\\n\"Some one below is asking for you.\"\\n\"Who is it?\"\\n\"He gives the name of Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer.\"\\n\"Hersheimmer,\" repeated Kramenin thoughtfully. \"I have heard\\nthat name before.\"\\n\"His father was one of the steel kings of America,\" explained the\\nsecretary, whose business it was to know everything. \"This young\\nman must be a millionaire several times over.\"\\nThe other\\'s eyes narrowed appreciatively.\\n\"You had better go down and see him, Ivan. Find out what he\\nwants.\"\\nThe secretary obeyed, closing the door noiselessly behind him. In\\na few minutes he returned.\\n\"He declines to state his business--says it is entirely private\\nand personal, and that he must see you.\"\\n\"A millionaire several times over,\" murmured Kramenin. \"Bring\\nhim up, my dear Ivan.\"\\nThe secretary left the room once more, and returned escorting\\nJulius.\\n\"Monsieur Kramenin?\" said the latter abruptly.\\nThe Russian, studying him attentively with his pale venomous\\neyes, bowed.\\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" said the American. \"I\\'ve got some very\\nimportant business I\\'d like to talk over with you, if I can see\\nyou alone.\" He looked pointedly at the other.\\n\"My secretary, Monsieur Grieber, from whom I have no secrets.\"\\n\"That may be so--but I have,\" said Julius dryly. \"So I\\'d be\\nobliged if you\\'d tell him to scoot.\"\\n\"Ivan,\" said the Russian softly, \"perhaps you would not mind\\nretiring into the next room----\"\\n\"The next room won\\'t do,\" interrupted Julius. \"I know these\\nducal suites--and I want this one plumb empty except for you and\\nme. Send him round to a store to buy a penn\\'orth of peanuts.\"\\nThough not particularly enjoying the American\\'s free and easy\\nmanner of speech, Kramenin was devoured by curiosity. \"Will your\\nbusiness take long to state?\"\\n\"Might be an all night job if you caught on.\"\\n\"Very good, Ivan. I shall not require you again this evening. Go\\nto the theatre--take a night off.\"\\n\"Thank you, your excellency.\"\\nThe secretary bowed and departed.\\nJulius stood at the door watching his retreat. Finally, with a\\nsatisfied sigh, he closed it, and came back to his position in\\nthe centre of the room.\\n\"Now, Mr. Hersheimmer, perhaps you will be so kind as to come to\\nthe point?\"\\n\"I guess that won\\'t take a minute,\" drawled Julius. Then, with\\nan abrupt change of manner: \"Hands up--or I shoot!\"\\nFor a moment Kramenin stared blindly into the big automatic,\\nthen, with almost comical haste, he flung up his hands above his\\nhead. In that instant Julius had taken his measure. The man he\\nhad to deal with was an abject physical coward--the rest would be\\neasy.\\n\"This is an outrage,\" cried the Russian in a high hysterical\\nvoice. \"An outrage! Do you mean to kill me?\"\\n\"Not if you keep your voice down. Don\\'t go edging sideways\\ntowards that bell. That\\'s better.\"\\n\"What do you want? Do nothing rashly. Remember my life is of\\nthe utmost value to my country. I may have been maligned----\"\\n\"I reckon,\" said Julius, \"that the man who let daylight into you\\nwould be doing humanity a good turn. But you needn\\'t worry any.\\nI\\'m not proposing to kill you this trip--that is, if you\\'re\\nreasonable.\"\\nThe Russian quailed before the stern menace in the other\\'s eyes.\\nHe passed his tongue over his dry lips.\\n\"What do you want? Money?\"\\n\"No. I want Jane Finn.\"\\n\"Jane Finn? I--never heard of her!\"\\n\"You\\'re a darned liar! You know perfectly who I mean.\"\\n\"I tell you I\\'ve never heard of the girl.\"\\n\"And I tell you,\" retorted Julius, \"that Little Willie here is\\njust hopping mad to go off!\"\\nThe Russian wilted visibly.\\n\"You wouldn\\'t dare----\"\\n\"Oh, yes, I would, son!\"\\nKramenin must have recognized something in the voice that carried\\nconviction, for he said sullenly:\\n\"Well? Granted I do know who you mean--what of it?\"\\n\"You will tell me now--right here--where she is to be found.\"\\nKramenin shook his head.\\n\"I daren\\'t.\"\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\"I daren\\'t. You ask an impossibility.\"\\n\"Afraid, eh? Of whom? Mr. Brown? Ah, that tickles you up!\\nThere is such a person, then? I doubted it. And the mere\\nmention of him scares you stiff!\"\\n\"I have seen him,\" said the Russian slowly. \"Spoken to him face\\nto face. I did not know it until afterwards. He was one of a\\ncrowd. I should not know him again. Who is he really? I do not\\nknow. But I know this--he is a man to fear.\"\\n\"He\\'ll never know,\" said Julius.\\n\"He knows everything--and his vengeance is swift. Even\\nI--Kramenin!--would not be exempt!\"\\n\"Then you won\\'t do as I ask you?\"\\n\"You ask an impossibility.\"\\n\"Sure that\\'s a pity for you,\" said Julius cheerfully. \"But the\\nworld in general will benefit.\" He raised the revolver.\\n\"Stop,\" shrieked the Russian. \"You cannot mean to shoot me?\"\\n\"Of course I do. I\\'ve always heard you Revolutionists held life\\ncheap, but it seems there\\'s a difference when it\\'s your own life\\nin question. I gave you just one chance of saving your dirty\\nskin, and that you wouldn\\'t take!\"\\n\"They would kill me!\"\\n\"Well,\" said Julius pleasantly, \"it\\'s up to you. But I\\'ll just\\nsay this. Little Willie here is a dead cert, and if I was you I\\'d\\ntake a sporting chance with Mr. Brown!\"\\n\"You will hang if you shoot me,\" muttered the Russian\\nirresolutely.\\n\"No, stranger, that\\'s where you\\'re wrong. You forget the\\ndollars. A big crowd of solicitors will get busy, and they\\'ll get\\nsome high-brow doctors on the job, and the end of it all will be\\nthat they\\'ll say my brain was unhinged. I shall spend a few\\nmonths in a quiet sanatorium, my mental health will improve, the\\ndoctors will declare me sane again, and all will end happily for\\nlittle Julius. I guess I can bear a few months\\' retirement in\\norder to rid the world of you, but don\\'t you kid yourself I\\'ll\\nhang for it!\"\\nThe Russian believed him. Corrupt himself, he believed\\nimplicitly in the power of money. He had read of American murder\\ntrials running much on the lines indicated by Julius. He had\\nbought and sold justice himself. This virile young American, with\\nthe significant drawling voice, had the whip hand of him.\\n\"I\\'m going to count five,\" continued Julius, \"and I guess, if you\\nlet me get past four, you needn\\'t worry any about Mr. Brown.\\nMaybe he\\'ll send some flowers to the funeral, but YOU won\\'t smell\\nthem! Are you ready? I\\'ll begin. One--two three--four----\"\\nThe Russian interrupted with a shriek:\\n\"Do not shoot. I will do all you wish.\"\\nJulius lowered the revolver.\\n\"I thought you\\'d hear sense. Where is the girl?\"\\n\"At Gatehouse, in Kent. Astley Priors, the place is called.\"\\n\"Is she a prisoner there?\"\\n\"She\\'s not allowed to leave the house--though it\\'s safe enough\\nreally. The little fool has lost her memory, curse her!\"\\n\"That\\'s been annoying for you and your friends, I reckon. What\\nabout the other girl, the one you decoyed away over a week ago?\"\\n\"She\\'s there too,\" said the Russian sullenly.\\n\"That\\'s good,\" said Julius. \"Isn\\'t it all panning out\\nbeautifully? And a lovely night for the run!\"\\n\"What run?\" demanded Kramenin, with a stare.\\n\"Down to Gatehouse, sure. I hope you\\'re fond of motoring?\"\\n\"What do you mean? I refuse to go.\"\\n\"Now don\\'t get mad. You must see I\\'m not such a kid as to leave\\nyou here. You\\'d ring up your friends on that telephone first\\nthing! Ah!\" He observed the fall on the other\\'s face. \"You\\nsee, you\\'d got it all fixed. No, sir, you\\'re coming along with\\nme. This your bedroom next door here? Walk right in. Little\\nWillie and I will come behind. Put on a thick coat, that\\'s\\nright. Fur lined? And you a Socialist! Now we\\'re ready. We\\nwalk downstairs and out through the hall to where my car\\'s\\nwaiting. And don\\'t you forget I\\'ve got you covered every inch of\\nthe way. I can shoot just as well through my coat pocket. One\\nword, or a glance even, at one of those liveried menials, and\\nthere\\'ll sure be a strange face in the Sulphur and Brimstone\\nWorks!\"\\nTogether they descended the stairs, and passed out to the waiting\\ncar. The Russian was shaking with rage. The hotel servants\\nsurrounded them. A cry hovered on his lips, but at the last\\nminute his nerve failed him. The American was a man of his word.\\nWhen they reached the car, Julius breathed a sigh of relief. The\\ndanger-zone was passed. Fear had successfully hypnotized the man\\nby his side.\\n\"Get in,\" he ordered. Then as he caught the other\\'s sidelong\\nglance, \"No, the chauffeur won\\'t help you any. Naval man. Was on\\na submarine in Russia when the Revolution broke out. A brother of\\nhis was murdered by your people. George!\"\\n\"Yes, sir?\" The chauffeur turned his head.\\n\"This gentleman is a Russian Bolshevik. We don\\'t want to shoot\\nhim, but it may be necessary. You understand?\"\\n\"Perfectly, sir.\"\\n\"I want to go to Gatehouse in Kent. Know the road at all?\"\\n\"Yes, sir, it will be about an hour and a half\\'s run.\"\\n\"Make it an hour. I\\'m in a hurry.\"\\n\"I\\'ll do my best, sir.\" The car shot forward through the\\ntraffic.\\nJulius ensconced himself comfortably by the side of his victim.\\nHe kept his hand in the pocket of his coat, but his manner was\\nurbane to the last degree.\\n\"There was a man I shot once in Arizona----\" he began cheerfully.\\nAt the end of the hour\\'s run the unfortunate Kramenin was more\\ndead than alive. In succession to the anecdote of the Arizona\\nman, there had been a tough from \\'Frisco, and an episode in the\\nRockies. Julius\\'s narrative style, if not strictly accurate, was\\npicturesque!\\nSlowing down, the chauffeur called over his shoulder that they\\nwere just coming into Gatehouse. Julius bade the Russian direct\\nthem. His plan was to drive straight up to the house. There\\nKramenin was to ask for the two girls. Julius explained to him\\nthat Little Willie would not be tolerant of failure. Kramenin, by\\nthis time, was as putty in the other\\'s hands. The terrific pace\\nthey had come had still further unmanned him. He had given\\nhimself up for dead at every corner.\\nThe car swept up the drive, and stopped before the porch. The\\nchauffeur looked round for orders.\\n\"Turn the car first, George. Then ring the bell, and get back to\\nyour place. Keep the engine going, and be ready to scoot like\\nhell when I give the word.\"\\n\"Very good, sir.\"\\nThe front door was opened by the butler. Kramenin felt the\\nmuzzle of the revolver pressed against his ribs.\\n\"Now,\" hissed Julius. \"And be careful.\"\\nThe Russian beckoned. His lips were white, and his voice was not\\nvery steady:\\n\"It is I--Kramenin! Bring down the girl at once! There is no\\ntime to lose!\"\\nWhittington had come down the steps. He uttered an exclamation\\nof astonishment at seeing the other.\\n\"You! What\\'s up? Surely you know the plan----\"\\nKramenin interrupted him, using the words that have created many\\nunnecessary panics:\\n\"We have been betrayed! Plans must be abandoned. We must save\\nour own skins. The girl! And at once! It\\'s our only chance.\"\\nWhittington hesitated, but for hardly a moment.\\n\"You have orders--from HIM?\"\\n\"Naturally! Should I be here otherwise? Hurry! There is no\\ntime to be lost. The other little fool had better come too.\"\\nWhittington turned and ran back into the house. The agonizing\\nminutes went by. Then--two figures hastily huddled in cloaks\\nappeared on the steps and were hustled into the car. The smaller\\nof the two was inclined to resist and Whittington shoved her in\\nunceremoniously. Julius leaned forward, and in doing so the\\nlight from the open door lit up his face. Another man on the\\nsteps behind Whittington gave a startled exclamation. Concealment\\nwas at an end.\\n\"Get a move on, George,\" shouted Julius.\\nThe chauffeur slipped in his clutch, and with a bound the car\\nstarted.\\nThe man on the steps uttered an oath. His hand went to his\\npocket. There was a flash and a report. The bullet just missed\\nthe taller girl by an inch.\\n\"Get down, Jane,\" cried Julius. \"Flat on the bottom of the car.\"\\nHe thrust her sharply forward, then standing up, he took careful\\naim and fired.\\n\"Have you hit him?\" cried Tuppence eagerly.\\n\"Sure,\" replied Julius. \"He isn\\'t killed, though. Skunks like\\nthat take a lot of killing. Are you all right, Tuppence?\"\\n\"Of course I am. Where\\'s Tommy? And who\\'s this?\" She indicated\\nthe shivering Kramenin.\\n\"Tommy\\'s making tracks for the Argentine. I guess he thought\\nyou\\'d turned up your toes. Steady through the gate, George!\\nThat\\'s right. It\\'ll take \\'em at least five minutes to get busy\\nafter us. They\\'ll use the telephone, I guess, so look out for\\nsnares ahead--and don\\'t take the direct route. Who\\'s this, did\\nyou say, Tuppence? Let me present Monsieur Kramenin. I\\npersuaded him to come on the trip for his health.\"\\nThe Russian remained mute, still livid with terror.\\n\"But what made them let us go?\" demanded Tuppence suspiciously.\\n\"I reckon Monsieur Kramenin here asked them so prettily they just\\ncouldn\\'t refuse!\"\\nThis was too much for the Russian. He burst out vehemently:\\n\"Curse you--curse you! They know now that I betrayed them. My\\nlife won\\'t be safe for an hour in this country.\"\\n\"That\\'s so,\" assented Julius. \"I\\'d advise you to make tracks for\\nRussia right away.\"\\n\"Let me go, then,\" cried the other. \"I have done what you asked.\\nWhy do you still keep me with you?\"\\n\"Not for the pleasure of your company. I guess you can get right\\noff now if you want to. I thought you\\'d rather I tooled you back\\nto London.\"\\n\"You may never reach London,\" snarled the other. \"Let me go here\\nand now.\"\\n\"Sure thing. Pull up, George. The gentleman\\'s not making the\\nreturn trip. If I ever come to Russia, Monsieur Kramenin, I shall\\nexpect a rousing welcome, and----\"\\nBut before Julius had finished his speech, and before the car had\\nfinally halted, the Russian had swung himself out and disappeared\\ninto the night.\\n\"Just a mite impatient to leave us,\" commented Julius, as the car\\ngathered way again. \"And no idea of saying good-bye politely to\\nthe ladies. Say, Jane, you can get up on the seat now.\"\\nFor the first time the girl spoke.\\n\"How did you \\'persuade\\' him?\" she asked.\\nJulius tapped his revolver.\\n\"Little Willie here takes the credit!\"\\n\"Splendid!\" cried the girl. The colour surged into her face, her\\neyes looked admiringly at Julius.\\n\"Annette and I didn\\'t know what was going to happen to us,\" said\\nTuppence. \"Old Whittington hurried us off. We thought it was\\nlambs to the slaughter.\"\\n\"Annette,\" said Julius. \"Is that what you call her?\"\\nHis mind seemed to be trying to adjust itself to a new idea.\\n\"It\\'s her name,\" said Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide.\\n\"Shucks!\" retorted Julius. \"She may think it\\'s her name, because\\nher memory\\'s gone, poor kid. But it\\'s the one real and original\\nJane Finn we\\'ve got here.\"\\n\"What?\" cried Tuppence.\\nBut she was interrupted. With an angry spurt, a bullet embedded\\nitself in the upholstery of the car just behind her head.\\n\"Down with you,\" cried Julius. \"It\\'s an ambush. These guys have\\ngot busy pretty quickly. Push her a bit, George.\"\\nThe car fairly leapt forward. Three more shots rang out, but\\nwent happily wide. Julius, upright, leant over the back of the\\ncar.\\n\"Nothing to shoot at,\" he announced gloomily. \"But I guess\\nthere\\'ll be another little picnic soon. Ah!\"\\nHe raised his hand to his cheek.\\n\"You are hurt?\" said Annette quickly.\\n\"Only a scratch.\"\\nThe girl sprang to her feet.\\n\"Let me out! Let me out, I say! Stop the car. It is me they\\'re\\nafter. I\\'m the one they want. You shall not lose your lives\\nbecause of me. Let me go.\" She was fumbling with the fastenings\\nof the door.\\nJulius took her by both arms, and looked at her. She had spoken\\nwith no trace of foreign accent.\\n\"Sit down, kid,\" he said gently. \"I guess there\\'s nothing wrong\\nwith your memory. Been fooling them all the time, eh?\"\\nThe girl looked at him, nodded, and then suddenly burst into\\ntears. Julius patted her on the shoulder.\\n\"There, there--just you sit tight. We\\'re not going to let you\\nquit.\"\\nThrough her sobs the girl said indistinctly:\\n\"You\\'re from home. I can tell by your voice. It makes me\\nhome-sick.\"\\n\"Sure I\\'m from home. I\\'m your cousin--Julius Hersheimmer. I\\ncame over to Europe on purpose to find you--and a pretty dance\\nyou\\'ve led me.\"\\nThe car slackened speed. George spoke over his shoulder:\\n\"Cross-roads here, sir. I\\'m not sure of the way.\"\\nThe car slowed down till it hardly moved. As it did so a figure\\nclimbed suddenly over the back, and plunged head first into the\\nmidst of them.\\n\"Sorry,\" said Tommy, extricating himself.\\nA mass of confused exclamations greeted him. He replied to them\\nseverally:\\n\"Was in the bushes by the drive. Hung on behind. Couldn\\'t let\\nyou know before at the pace you were going. It was all I could\\ndo to hang on. Now then, you girls, get out!\"\\n\"Get out?\"\\n\"Yes. There\\'s a station just up that road. Train due in three\\nminutes. You\\'ll catch it if you hurry.\"\\n\"What the devil are you driving at?\" demanded Julius. \"Do you\\nthink you can fool them by leaving the car?\"\\n\"You and I aren\\'t going to leave the car. Only the girls.\"\\n\"You\\'re crazed, Beresford. Stark staring mad! You can\\'t let\\nthose girls go off alone. It\\'ll be the end of it if you do.\"\\nTommy turned to Tuppence.\\n\"Get out at once, Tuppence. Take her with you, and do just as I\\nsay. No one will do you any harm. You\\'re safe. Take the train\\nto London. Go straight to Sir James Peel Edgerton. Mr. Carter\\nlives out of town, but you\\'ll be safe with him.\"\\n\"Darn you!\" cried Julius. \"You\\'re mad. Jane, you stay where you\\nare.\"\\nWith a sudden swift movement, Tommy snatched the revolver from\\nJulius\\'s hand, and levelled it at him.\\n\"Now will you believe I\\'m in earnest? Get out, both of you, and\\ndo as I say--or I\\'ll shoot!\"\\nTuppence sprang out, dragging the unwilling Jane after her.\\n\"Come on, it\\'s all right. If Tommy\\'s sure--he\\'s sure. Be quick.\\nWe\\'ll miss the train.\"\\nThey started running.\\nJulius\\'s pent-up rage burst forth.\\n\"What the hell----\"\\nTommy interrupted him.\\n\"Dry up! I want a few words with you, Mr. Julius Hersheimmer.\"\\nCHAPTER\\nXXV\\nJANE\\'S STORY\\nHER arm through Jane\\'s, dragging her along, Tuppence reached the\\nstation. Her quick ears caught the sound of the approaching\\ntrain.\\n\"Hurry up,\" she panted, \"or we\\'ll miss it.\"\\nThey arrived on the platform just as the train came to a\\nstandstill. Tuppence opened the door of an empty first-class\\ncompartment, and the two girls sank down breathless on the padded\\nseats.\\nA man looked in, then passed on to the next carriage. Jane\\nstarted nervously. Her eyes dilated with terror. She looked\\nquestioningly at Tuppence.\\n\"Is he one of them, do you think?\" she breathed.\\nTuppence shook her head.\\n\"No, no. It\\'s all right.\" She took Jane\\'s hand in hers. \"Tommy\\nwouldn\\'t have told us to do this unless he was sure we\\'d be all\\nright.\"\\n\"But he doesn\\'t know them as I do!\" The girl shivered. \"You\\ncan\\'t understand. Five years! Five long years! Sometimes I\\nthought I should go mad.\"\\n\"Never mind. It\\'s all over.\"\\n\"Is it?\"\\nThe train was moving now, speeding through the night at a\\ngradually increasing rate. Suddenly Jane Finn started up.\\n\"What was that? I thought I saw a face--looking in through the\\nwindow.\"\\n\"No, there\\'s nothing. See.\" Tuppence went to the window, and\\nlifting the strap let the pane down.\\n\"You\\'re sure?\"\\n\"Quite sure.\"\\nThe other seemed to feel some excuse was necessary:\\n\"I guess I\\'m acting like a frightened rabbit, but I can\\'t help\\nit. If they caught me now they\\'d----\" Her eyes opened wide and\\nstaring.\\n\"DON\\'T!\" implored Tuppence. \"Lie back, and DON\\'T THINK. You can\\nbe quite sure that Tommy wouldn\\'t have said it was safe if it\\nwasn\\'t.\"\\n\"My cousin didn\\'t think so. He didn\\'t want us to do this.\"\\n\"No,\" said Tuppence, rather embarrassed.\\n\"What are you thinking of?\" said Jane sharply.\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Your voice was so--queer!\"\\n\"I WAS thinking of something,\" confessed Tuppence. \"But I don\\'t\\nwant to tell you--not now. I may be wrong, but I don\\'t think so.\\nIt\\'s just an idea that came into my head a long time ago. Tommy\\'s\\ngot it too--I\\'m almost sure he has. But don\\'t YOU\\nworry--there\\'ll be time enough for that later. And it mayn\\'t be\\nso at all! Do what I tell you--lie back and don\\'t think of\\nanything.\"\\n\"I\\'ll try.\" The long lashes drooped over the hazel eyes.\\nTuppence, for her part, sat bolt upright--much in the attitude of\\na watchful terrier on guard. In spite of herself she was\\nnervous. Her eyes flashed continually from one window to the\\nother. She noted the exact position of the communication cord.\\nWhat it was that she feared, she would have been hard put to it\\nto say. But in her own mind she was far from feeling the\\nconfidence displayed in her words. Not that she disbelieved in\\nTommy, but occasionally she was shaken with doubts as to whether\\nanyone so simple and honest as he was could ever be a match for\\nthe fiendish subtlety of the arch-criminal.\\nIf they once reached Sir James Peel Edgerton in safety, all would\\nbe well. But would they reach him? Would not the silent forces\\nof Mr. Brown already be assembling against them? Even that last\\npicture of Tommy, revolver in hand, failed to comfort her. By\\nnow he might be overpowered, borne down by sheer force of\\nnumbers.... Tuppence mapped out her plan of campaign.\\nAs the train at length drew slowly into Charing Cross, Jane Finn\\nsat up with a start.\\n\"Have we arrived? I never thought we should!\"\\n\"Oh, I thought we\\'d get to London all right. If there\\'s going to\\nbe any fun, now is when it will begin. Quick, get out. We\\'ll nip\\ninto a taxi.\"\\nIn another minute they were passing the barrier, had paid the\\nnecessary fares, and were stepping into a taxi.\\n\"King\\'s Cross,\" directed Tuppence. Then she gave a jump. A man\\nlooked in at the window, just as they started. She was almost\\ncertain it was the same man who had got into the carriage next to\\nthem. She had a horrible feeling of being slowly hemmed in on\\nevery side.\\n\"You see,\" she explained to Jane, \"if they think we\\'re going to\\nSir James, this will put them off the scent. Now they\\'ll imagine\\nwe\\'re going to Mr. Carter. His country place is north of London\\nsomewhere.\"\\nCrossing Holborn there was a block, and the taxi was held up.\\nThis was what Tuppence had been waiting for.\\n\"Quick,\" she whispered. \"Open the right-hand door!\"\\nThe two girls stepped out into the traffic. Two minutes later\\nthey were seated in another taxi and were retracing their steps,\\nthis time direct to Carlton House Terrace.\\n\"There,\" said Tuppence, with great satisfaction, \"this ought to\\ndo them. I can\\'t help thinking that I\\'m really rather clever!\\nHow that other taxi man will swear! But I took his number, and\\nI\\'ll send him a postal order to-morrow, so that he won\\'t lose by\\nit if he happens to be genuine. What\\'s this thing\\nswerving----Oh!\"\\nThere was a grinding noise and a bump. Another taxi had collided\\nwith them.\\nIn a flash Tuppence was out on the pavement. A policeman was\\napproaching. Before he arrived Tuppence had handed the driver\\nfive shillings, and she and Jane had merged themselves in the\\ncrowd.\\n\"It\\'s only a step or two now,\" said Tuppence breathlessly. The\\naccident had taken place in Trafalgar Square.\\n\"Do you think the collision was an accident, or done\\ndeliberately?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know. It might have been either.\"\\nHand-in-hand, the two girls hurried along.\\n\"It may be my fancy,\" said Tuppence suddenly, \"but I feel as\\nthough there was some one behind us.\"\\n\"Hurry!\" murmured the other. \"Oh, hurry!\"\\nThey were now at the corner of Carlton House Terrace, and their\\nspirits lightened. Suddenly a large and apparently intoxicated\\nman barred their way.\\n\"Good evening, ladies,\" he hiccupped. \"Whither away so fast?\"\\n\"Let us pass, please,\" said Tuppence imperiously.\\n\"Just a word with your pretty friend here.\" He stretched out an\\nunsteady hand, and clutched Jane by the shoulder. Tuppence heard\\nother footsteps behind. She did not pause to ascertain whether\\nthey were friends or foes. Lowering her head, she repeated a\\nmanoeuvre of childish days, and butted their aggressor full in\\nthe capacious middle. The success of these unsportsmanlike\\ntactics was immediate. The man sat down abruptly on the pavement.\\nTuppence and Jane took to their heels. The house they sought was\\nsome way down. Other footsteps echoed behind them. Their breath\\nwas coming in choking gasps as they reached Sir James\\'s door.\\nTuppence seized the bell and Jane the knocker.\\nThe man who had stopped them reached the foot of the steps. For a\\nmoment he hesitated, and as he did so the door opened. They fell\\ninto the hall together. Sir James came forward from the library\\ndoor.\\n\"Hullo! What\\'s this?\"\\nHe stepped forward, and put his arm round Jane as she swayed\\nuncertainly. He half carried her into the library, and laid her\\non the leather couch. From a tantalus on the table he poured out\\na few drops of brandy, and forced her to drink them. With a sigh\\nshe sat up, her eyes still wild and frightened.\\n\"It\\'s all right. Don\\'t be afraid, my child. You\\'re quite safe.\"\\nHer breath came more normally, and the colour was returning to\\nher cheeks. Sir James looked at Tuppence quizzically.\\n\"So you\\'re not dead, Miss Tuppence, any more than that Tommy boy\\nof yours was!\"\\n\"The Young Adventurers take a lot of killing,\" boasted Tuppence.\\n\"So it seems,\" said Sir James dryly. \"Am I right in thinking\\nthat the joint venture has ended in success, and that this\"--he\\nturned to the girl on the couch--\"is Miss Jane Finn?\"\\nJane sat up.\\n\"Yes,\" she said quietly, \"I am Jane Finn. I have a lot to tell\\nyou.\"\\n\"When you are stronger----\"\\n\"No--now!\" Her voice rose a little. \"I shall feel safer when I\\nhave told everything.\"\\n\"As you please,\" said the lawyer.\\nHe sat down in one of the big arm-chairs facing the couch. In a\\nlow voice Jane began her story.\\n\"I came over on the Lusitania to take up a post in Paris. I was\\nfearfully keen about the war, and just dying to help somehow or\\nother. I had been studying French, and my teacher said they were\\nwanting help in a hospital in Paris, so I wrote and offered my\\nservices, and they were accepted. I hadn\\'t got any folk of my\\nown, so it made it easy to arrange things.\\n\"When the Lusitania was torpedoed, a man came up to me. I\\'d\\nnoticed him more than once--and I\\'d figured it out in my own mind\\nthat he was afraid of somebody or something. He asked me if I\\nwas a patriotic American, and told me he was carrying papers\\nwhich were just life or death to the Allies. He asked me to take\\ncharge of them. I was to watch for an advertisement in the Times.\\nIf it didn\\'t appear, I was to take them to the American\\nAmbassador.\\n\"Most of what followed seems like a nightmare still. I see it in\\nmy dreams sometimes.... I\\'ll hurry over that part. Mr. Danvers\\nhad told me to watch out. He might have been shadowed from New\\nYork, but he didn\\'t think so. At first I had no suspicions, but\\non the boat to Holyhead I began to get uneasy. There was one\\nwoman who had been very keen to look after me, and chum up with\\nme generally--a Mrs. Vandemeyer. At first I\\'d been only grateful\\nto her for being so kind to me; but all the time I felt there was\\nsomething about her I didn\\'t like, and on the Irish boat I saw\\nher talking to some queer-looking men, and from the way they\\nlooked I saw that they were talking about me. I remembered that\\nshe\\'d been quite near me on the Lusitania when Mr. Danvers gave\\nme the packet, and before that she\\'d tried to talk to him once or\\ntwice. I began to get scared, but I didn\\'t quite see what to do.\\n\"I had a wild idea of stopping at Holyhead, and not going on to\\nLondon that day, but I soon saw that that would be plumb\\nfoolishness. The only thing was to act as though I\\'d noticed\\nnothing, and hope for the best. I couldn\\'t see how they could\\nget me if I was on my guard. One thing I\\'d done already as a\\nprecaution--ripped open the oilskin packet and substituted blank\\npaper, and then sewn it up again. So, if anyone did manage to rob\\nme of it, it wouldn\\'t matter.\\n\"What to do with the real thing worried me no end. Finally I\\nopened it out flat--there were only two sheets--and laid it\\nbetween two of the advertisement pages of a magazine. I stuck the\\ntwo pages together round the edge with some gum off an envelope.\\nI carried the magazine carelessly stuffed into the pocket of my\\nulster.\\n\"At Holyhead I tried to get into a carriage with people that\\nlooked all right, but in a queer way there seemed always to be a\\ncrowd round me shoving and pushing me just the way I didn\\'t want\\nto go. There was something uncanny and frightening about it. In\\nthe end I found myself in a carriage with Mrs. Vandemeyer after\\nall. I went out into the corridor, but all the other carriages\\nwere full, so I had to go back and sit down. I consoled myself\\nwith the thought that there were other people in the\\ncarriage--there was quite a nice-looking man and his wife sitting\\njust opposite. So I felt almost happy about it until just outside\\nLondon. I had leaned back and closed my eyes. I guess they\\nthought I was asleep, but my eyes weren\\'t quite shut, and\\nsuddenly I saw the nice-looking man get something out of his bag\\nand hand it to Mrs. Vandemeyer, and as he did so he WINKED....\\n\"I can\\'t tell you how that wink sort of froze me through and\\nthrough. My only thought was to get out in the corridor as quick\\nas ever I could. I got up, trying to look natural and easy.\\nPerhaps they saw something--I don\\'t know--but suddenly Mrs.\\nVandemeyer said \\'Now,\\' and flung something over my nose and mouth\\nas I tried to scream. At the same moment I felt a terrific blow\\non the back of my head....\"\\nShe shuddered. Sir James murmured something sympathetically. In\\na minute she resumed:\\n\"I don\\'t know how long it was before I came back to\\nconsciousness. I felt very ill and sick. I was lying on a dirty\\nbed. There was a screen round it, but I could hear two people\\ntalking in the room. Mrs. Vandemeyer was one of them. I tried to\\nlisten, but at first I couldn\\'t take much in. When at last I did\\nbegin to grasp what was going on--I was just terrified! I wonder\\nI didn\\'t scream right out there and then.\\n\"They hadn\\'t found the papers. They\\'d got the oilskin packet\\nwith the blanks, and they were just mad! They didn\\'t know\\nwhether I\\'d changed the papers, or whether Danvers had been\\ncarrying a dummy message, while the real one was sent another\\nway. They spoke of\"--she closed her eyes--\"torturing me to find\\nout!\\n\"I\\'d never known what fear--really sickening fear--was before!\\nOnce they came to look at me. I shut my eyes and pretended to be\\nstill unconscious, but I was afraid they\\'d hear the beating of my\\nheart. However, they went away again. I began thinking madly.\\nWhat could I do? I knew I wouldn\\'t be able to stand up against\\ntorture very long.\\n\"Suddenly something put the thought of loss of memory into my\\nhead. The subject had always interested me, and I\\'d read an awful\\nlot about it. I had the whole thing at my finger-tips. If only I\\ncould succeed in carrying the bluff through, it might save me. I\\nsaid a prayer, and drew a long breath. Then I opened my eyes and\\nstarted babbling in FRENCH!\\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer came round the screen at once. Her face was so\\nwicked I nearly died, but I smiled up at her doubtfully, and\\nasked her in French where I was.\\n\"It puzzled her, I could see. She called the man she had been\\ntalking to. He stood by the screen with his face in shadow. He\\nspoke to me in French. His voice was very ordinary and quiet,\\nbut somehow, I don\\'t know why, he scared me worse than the woman.\\nI felt he\\'d seen right through me, but I went on playing my part.\\nI asked again where I was, and then went on that there was\\nsomething I MUST remember--MUST remember--only for the moment it\\nwas all gone. I worked myself up to be more and more distressed.\\nHe asked me my name. I said I didn\\'t know--that I couldn\\'t\\nremember anything at all.\\n\"Suddenly he caught my wrist, and began twisting it. The pain\\nwas awful. I screamed. He went on. I screamed and screamed, but\\nI managed to shriek out things in French. I don\\'t know how long\\nI could have gone on, but luckily I fainted. The last thing I\\nheard was his voice saying: \\'That\\'s not bluff! Anyway, a kid of\\nher age wouldn\\'t know enough.\\' I guess he forgot American girls\\nare older for their age than English ones, and take more interest\\nin scientific subjects.\\n\"When I came to, Mrs. Vandemeyer was sweet as honey to me. She\\'d\\nhad her orders, I guess. She spoke to me in French--told me I\\'d\\nhad a shock and been very ill. I should be better soon. I\\npretended to be rather dazed--murmured something about the\\n\\'doctor\\' having hurt my wrist. She looked relieved when I said\\nthat.\\n\"By and by she went out of the room altogether. I was suspicious\\nstill, and lay quite quiet for some time. In the end, however, I\\ngot up and walked round the room, examining it. I thought that\\neven if anyone WAS watching me from somewhere, it would seem\\nnatural enough under the circumstances. It was a squalid, dirty\\nplace. There were no windows, which seemed queer. I guessed the\\ndoor would be locked, but I didn\\'t try it. There were some\\nbattered old pictures on the walls, representing scenes from\\nFaust.\"\\nJane\\'s two listeners gave a simultaneous \"Ah!\" The girl nodded.\\n\"Yes--it was the place in Soho where Mr. Beresford was\\nimprisoned. Of course, at the time I didn\\'t even know if I was in\\nLondon. One thing was worrying me dreadfully, but my heart gave\\na great throb of relief when I saw my ulster lying carelessly\\nover the back of a chair. AND THE MAGAZINE WAS STILL ROLLED UP IN\\nTHE POCKET!\\n\"If only I could be certain that I was not being overlooked! I\\nlooked carefully round the walls. There didn\\'t seem to be a\\npeep-hole of any kind--nevertheless I felt kind of sure there\\nmust be. All of a sudden I sat down on the edge of the table, and\\nput my face in my hands, sobbing out a \\'Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!\\'\\nI\\'ve got very sharp ears. I distinctly heard the rustle of a\\ndress, and slight creak. That was enough for me. I was being\\nwatched!\\n\"I lay down on the bed again, and by and by Mrs. Vandemeyer\\nbrought me some supper. She was still sweet as they make them. I\\nguess she\\'d been told to win my confidence. Presently she\\nproduced the oilskin packet, and asked me if I recognized it,\\nwatching me like a lynx all the time.\\n\"I took it and turned it over in a puzzled sort of way. Then I\\nshook my head. I said that I felt I OUGHT to remember something\\nabout it, that it was just as though it was all coming back, and\\nthen, before I could get hold of it, it went again. Then she told\\nme that I was her niece, and that I was to call her \\'Aunt Rita.\\'\\nI did obediently, and she told me not to worry--my memory would\\nsoon come back.\\n\"That was an awful night. I\\'d made my plan whilst I was waiting\\nfor her. The papers were safe so far, but I couldn\\'t take the\\nrisk of leaving them there any longer. They might throw that\\nmagazine away any minute. I lay awake waiting until I judged it\\nmust be about two o\\'clock in the morning. Then I got up as\\nsoftly as I could, and felt in the dark along the left-hand wall.\\nVery gently, I unhooked one of the pictures from its\\nnail--Marguerite with her casket of jewels. I crept over to my\\ncoat and took out the magazine, and an odd envelope or two that I\\nhad shoved in. Then I went to the washstand, and damped the\\nbrown paper at the back of the picture all round. Presently I was\\nable to pull it away. I had already torn out the two\\nstuck-together pages from the magazine, and now I slipped them\\nwith their precious enclosure between the picture and its brown\\npaper backing. A little gum from the envelopes helped me to stick\\nthe latter up again. No one would dream the picture had ever been\\ntampered with. I rehung it on the wall, put the magazine back in\\nmy coat pocket, and crept back to bed. I was pleased with my\\nhiding-place. They\\'d never think of pulling to pieces one of\\ntheir own pictures. I hoped that they\\'d come to the conclusion\\nthat Danvers had been carrying a dummy all along, and that, in\\nthe end, they\\'d let me go.\\n\"As a matter of fact, I guess that\\'s what they did think at\\nfirst, and, in a way, it was dangerous for me. I learnt\\nafterwards that they nearly did away with me then and\\nthere--there was never much chance of their \\'letting me go\\'--but\\nthe first man, who was the boss, preferred to keep me alive on\\nthe chance of my having hidden them, and being able to tell where\\nif I recovered my memory. They watched me constantly for weeks.\\nSometimes they\\'d ask me questions by the hour--I guess there was\\nnothing they didn\\'t know about the third degree!--but somehow I\\nmanaged to hold my own. The strain of it was awful, though . . .\\n\"They took me back to Ireland, and over every step of the Journey\\nagain, in case I\\'d hidden it somewhere en route. Mrs. Vandemeyer\\nand another woman never left me for a moment. They spoke of me as\\na young relative of Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s whose mind was affected by\\nthe shock of the Lusitania. There was no one I could appeal to\\nfor help without giving myself away to THEM, and if I risked it\\nand failed--and Mrs. Vandemeyer looked so rich, and so\\nbeautifully dressed, that I felt convinced they\\'d take her word\\nagainst mine, and think it was part of my mental trouble to think\\nmyself \\'persecuted\\'--I felt that the horrors in store for me\\nwould be too awful once they knew I\\'d been only shamming.\"\\nSir James nodded comprehendingly.\\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer was a woman of great personality. With that and\\nher social position she would have had little difficulty in\\nimposing her point of view in preference to yours. Your\\nsensational accusations against her would not easily have found\\ncredence.\"\\n\"That\\'s what I thought. It ended in my being sent to a\\nsanatorium at Bournemouth. I couldn\\'t make up my mind at first\\nwhether it was a sham affair or genuine. A hospital nurse had\\ncharge of me. I was a special patient. She seemed so nice and\\nnormal that at last I determined to confide in her. A merciful\\nprovidence just saved me in time from falling into the trap. My\\ndoor happened to be ajar, and I heard her talking to some one in\\nthe passage. SHE WAS ONE OF THEM! They still fancied it might be\\na bluff on my part, and she was put in charge of me to make sure!\\nAfter that, my nerve went completely. I dared trust nobody.\\n\"I think I almost hypnotized myself. After a while, I almost\\nforgot that I was really Jane Finn. I was so bent on playing the\\npart of Janet Vandemeyer that my nerves began to play me tricks.\\nI became really ill--for months I sank into a sort of stupor. I\\nfelt sure I should die soon, and that nothing really mattered. A\\nsane person shut up in a lunatic asylum often ends by becoming\\ninsane, they say. I guess I was like that. Playing my part had\\nbecome second nature to me. I wasn\\'t even unhappy in the\\nend--just apathetic. Nothing seemed to matter. And the years\\nwent on.\\n\"And then suddenly things seemed to change. Mrs. Vandemeyer came\\ndown from London. She and the doctor asked me questions,\\nexperimented with various treatments. There was some talk of\\nsending me to a specialist in Paris. In the end, they did not\\ndare risk it. I overheard something that seemed to show that\\nother people--friends--were looking for me. I learnt later that\\nthe nurse who had looked after me went to Paris, and consulted a\\nspecialist, representing herself to be me. He put her through\\nsome searching tests, and exposed her loss of memory to be\\nfraudulent; but she had taken a note of his methods and\\nreproduced them on me. I dare say I couldn\\'t have deceived the\\nspecialist for a minute--a man who has made a lifelong study of a\\nthing is unique--but I managed once again to hold my own with\\nthem. The fact that I\\'d not thought of myself as Jane Finn for so\\nlong made it easier.\\n\"One night I was whisked off to London at a moment\\'s notice. They\\ntook me back to the house in Soho. Once I got away from the\\nsanatorium I felt different--as though something in me that had\\nbeen buried for a long time was waking up again.\\n\"They sent me in to wait on Mr. Beresford. (Of course I didn\\'t\\nknow his name then.) I was suspicious--I thought it was another\\ntrap. But he looked so honest, I could hardly believe it.\\nHowever, I was careful in all I said, for I knew we could be\\noverheard. There\\'s a small hole, high up in the wall.\\n\"But on the Sunday afternoon a message was brought to the house.\\nThey were all very disturbed. Without their knowing, I listened.\\nWord had come that he was to be killed. I needn\\'t tell the next\\npart, because you know it. I thought I\\'d have time to rush up\\nand get the papers from their hiding-place, but I was caught. So\\nI screamed out that he was escaping, and I said I wanted to go\\nback to Marguerite. I shouted the name three times very loud. I\\nknew the others would think I meant Mrs. Vandemeyer, but I hoped\\nit might make Mr. Beresford think of the picture. He\\'d unhooked\\none the first day--that\\'s what made me hesitate to trust him.\"\\nShe paused.\\n\"Then the papers,\" said Sir James slowly, \"are still at the back\\nof the picture in that room.\"\\n\"Yes.\" The girl had sunk back on the sofa exhausted with the\\nstrain of the long story.\\nSir James rose to his feet. He looked at his watch.\\n\"Come,\" he said, \"we must go at once.\"\\n\"To-night?\" queried Tuppence, surprised.\\n\"To-morrow may be too late,\" said Sir James gravely. \"Besides, by\\ngoing to-night we have the chance of capturing that great man and\\nsuper-criminal--Mr. Brown!\"\\nThere was dead silence, and Sir James continued:\\n\"You have been followed here--not a doubt of it. When we leave\\nthe house we shall be followed again, but not molested, FOR IT IS\\nMR. BROWN\\'S PLAN THAT WE ARE TO LEAD HIM. But the Soho house is\\nunder police supervision night and day. There are several men\\nwatching it. When we enter that house, Mr. Brown will not draw\\nback--he will risk all, on the chance of obtaining the spark to\\nfire his mine. And he fancies the risk not great--since he will\\nenter in the guise of a friend!\"\\nTuppence flushed, then opened her mouth impulsively.\\n\"But there\\'s something you don\\'t know--that we haven\\'t told you.\"\\nHer eyes dwelt on Jane in perplexity.\\n\"What is that?\" asked the other sharply. \"No hesitations, Miss\\nTuppence. We need to be sure of our going.\"\\nBut Tuppence, for once, seemed tongue-tied.\\n\"It\\'s so difficult--you see, if I\\'m wrong--oh, it would be\\ndreadful.\" She made a grimace at the unconscious Jane. \"Never\\nforgive me,\" she observed cryptically.\\n\"You want me to help you out, eh?\"\\n\"Yes, please. YOU know who Mr. Brown is, don\\'t you?\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Sir James gravely. \"At last I do.\"\\n\"At last?\" queried Tuppence doubtfully. \"Oh, but I thought----\"\\nShe paused.\\n\"You thought correctly, Miss Tuppence. I have been morally\\ncertain of his identity for some time--ever since the night of\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s mysterious death.\"\\n\"Ah!\" breathed Tuppence.\\n\"For there we are up against the logic of facts. There are only\\ntwo solutions. Either the chloral was administered by her own\\nhand, which theory I reject utterly, or else----\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"Or else it was administered in the brandy you gave her. Only\\nthree people touched that brandy--you, Miss Tuppence, I myself,\\nand one other--Mr. Julius Hersheimmer!\"\\nJane Finn stirred and sat up, regarding the speaker with wide\\nastonished eyes.\\n\"At first, the thing seemed utterly impossible. Mr. Hersheimmer,\\nas the son of a prominent millionaire, was a well-known figure in\\nAmerica. It seemed utterly impossible that he and Mr. Brown\\ncould be one and the same. But you cannot escape from the logic\\nof facts. Since the thing was so--it must be accepted. Remember\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s sudden and inexplicable agitation. Another\\nproof, if proof was needed.\\n\"I took an early opportunity of giving you a hint. From some\\nwords of Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s at Manchester, I gathered that you had\\nunderstood and acted on that hint. Then I set to work to prove\\nthe impossible possible. Mr. Beresford rang me up and told me,\\nwhat I had already suspected, that the photograph of Miss Jane\\nFinn had never really been out of Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s\\npossession----\"\\nBut the girl interrupted. Springing to her feet, she cried out\\nangrily:\\n\"What do you mean? What are you trying to suggest? That Mr.\\nBrown is JULIUS? Julius--my own cousin!\"\\n\"No, Miss Finn,\" said Sir James unexpectedly. \"Not your cousin.\\nThe man who calls himself Julius Hersheimmer is no relation to\\nyou whatsoever.\"\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\nMR. BROWN\\nSIR James\\'s words came like a bomb-shell. Both girls looked\\nequally puzzled. The lawyer went across to his desk, and returned\\nwith a small newspaper cutting, which he handed to Jane.\\nTuppence read it over her shoulder. Mr. Carter would have\\nrecognized it. It referred to the mysterious man found dead in\\nNew York.\\n\"As I was saying to Miss Tuppence,\" resumed the lawyer, \"I set to\\nwork to prove the impossible possible. The great stumbling-block\\nwas the undeniable fact that Julius Hersheimmer was not an\\nassumed name. When I came across this paragraph my problem was\\nsolved. Julius Hersheimmer set out to discover what had become of\\nhis cousin. He went out West, where he obtained news of her and\\nher photograph to aid him in his search. On the eve of his\\ndeparture from New York he was set upon and murdered. His body\\nwas dressed in shabby clothes, and the face disfigured to prevent\\nidentification. Mr. Brown took his place. He sailed immediately\\nfor England. None of the real Hersheimmer\\'s friends or intimates\\nsaw him before he sailed--though indeed it would hardly have\\nmattered if they had, the impersonation was so perfect. Since\\nthen he had been hand and glove with those sworn to hunt him\\ndown. Every secret of theirs has been known to him. Only once\\ndid he come near disaster. Mrs. Vandemeyer knew his secret. It\\nwas no part of his plan that that huge bribe should ever be\\noffered to her. But for Miss Tuppence\\'s fortunate change of\\nplan, she would have been far away from the flat when we arrived\\nthere. Exposure stared him in the face. He took a desperate\\nstep, trusting in his assumed character to avert suspicion. He\\nnearly succeeded--but not quite.\"\\n\"I can\\'t believe it,\" murmured Jane. \"He seemed so splendid.\"\\n\"The real Julius Hersheimmer WAS a splendid fellow! And Mr. Brown\\nis a consummate actor. But ask Miss Tuppence if she also has not\\nhad her suspicions.\"\\nJane turned mutely to Tuppence. The latter nodded.\\n\"I didn\\'t want to say it, Jane--I knew it would hurt you. And,\\nafter all, I couldn\\'t be sure. I still don\\'t understand why, if\\nhe\\'s Mr. Brown, he rescued us.\"\\n\"Was it Julius Hersheimmer who helped you to escape?\"\\nTuppence recounted to Sir James the exciting events of the\\nevening, ending up: \"But I can\\'t see WHY!\"\\n\"Can\\'t you? I can. So can young Beresford, by his actions. As a\\nlast hope Jane Finn was to be allowed to escape--and the escape\\nmust be managed so that she harbours no suspicions of its being a\\nput-up job. They\\'re not averse to young Beresford\\'s being in the\\nneighbourhood, and, if necessary, communicating with you. They\\'ll\\ntake care to get him out of the way at the right minute. Then\\nJulius Hersheimmer dashes up and rescues you in true melodramatic\\nstyle. Bullets fly--but don\\'t hit anybody. What would have\\nhappened next? You would have driven straight to the house in\\nSoho and secured the document which Miss Finn would probably have\\nentrusted to her cousin\\'s keeping. Or, if he conducted the\\nsearch, he would have pretended to find the hiding-place already\\nrifled. He would have had a dozen ways of dealing with the\\nsituation, but the result would have been the same. And I rather\\nfancy some accident would have happened to both of you. You see,\\nyou know rather an inconvenient amount. That\\'s a rough outline.\\nI admit I was caught napping; but somebody else wasn\\'t.\"\\n\"Tommy,\" said Tuppence softly.\\n\"Yes. Evidently when the right moment came to get rid of him--he\\nwas too sharp for them. All the same, I\\'m not too easy in my\\nmind about him.\"\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Because Julius Hersheimmer is Mr. Brown,\" said Sir James dryly.\\n\"And it takes more than one man and a revolver to hold up Mr.\\nBrown....\"\\nTuppence paled a little.\\n\"What can we do?\"\\n\"Nothing until we\\'ve been to the house in Soho. If Beresford has\\nstill got the upper hand, there\\'s nothing to fear. If otherwise,\\nour enemy will come to find us, and he will not find us\\nunprepared!\" From a drawer in the desk, he took a service\\nrevolver, and placed it in his coat pocket.\\n\"Now we\\'re ready. I know better than even to suggest going\\nwithout you, Miss Tuppence----\"\\n\"I should think so indeed!\"\\n\"But I do suggest that Miss Finn should remain here. She will be\\nperfectly safe, and I am afraid she is absolutely worn out with\\nall she has been through.\"\\nBut to Tuppence\\'s surprise Jane shook her head.\\n\"No. I guess I\\'m going too. Those papers were my trust. I must\\ngo through with this business to the end. I\\'m heaps better now\\nanyway.\"\\nSir James\\'s car was ordered round. During the short drive\\nTuppence\\'s heart beat tumultuously. In spite of momentary qualms\\nof uneasiness respecting Tommy, she could not but feel\\nexultation. They were going to win!\\nThe car drew up at the corner of the square and they got out. Sir\\nJames went up to a plain-clothes man who was on duty with several\\nothers, and spoke to him. Then he rejoined the girls.\\n\"No one has gone into the house so far. It is being watched at\\nthe back as well, so they are quite sure of that. Anyone who\\nattempts to enter after we have done so will be arrested\\nimmediately. Shall we go in?\"\\nA policeman produced a key. They all knew Sir James well. They\\nhad also had orders respecting Tuppence. Only the third member\\nof the party was unknown to them. The three entered the house,\\npulling the door to behind them. Slowly they mounted the rickety\\nstairs. At the top was the ragged curtain hiding the recess where\\nTommy had hidden that day. Tuppence had heard the story from\\nJane in her character of \"Annette.\" She looked at the tattered\\nvelvet with interest. Even now she could almost swear it\\nmoved--as though some one was behind it. So strong was the\\nillusion that she almost fancied she could make out the outline\\nof a form.... Supposing Mr. Brown--Julius--was there waiting....\\nImpossible of course! Yet she almost went back to put the\\ncurtain aside and make sure....\\nNow they were entering the prison room. No place for anyone to\\nhide here, thought Tuppence, with a sigh of relief, then chided\\nherself indignantly. She must not give way to this foolish\\nfancying--this curious insistent feeling that MR. BROWN WAS IN\\nTHE HOUSE.... Hark! what was that? A stealthy footstep on the\\nstairs? There WAS some one in the house! Absurd! She was\\nbecoming hysterical.\\nJane had gone straight to the picture of Marguerite. She\\nunhooked it with a steady hand. The dust lay thick upon it, and\\nfestoons of cobwebs lay between it and the wall. Sir James\\nhanded her a pocket-knife, and she ripped away the brown paper\\nfrom the back.... The advertisement page of a magazine fell out.\\nJane picked it up. Holding apart the frayed inner edges she\\nextracted two thin sheets covered with writing!\\nNo dummy this time! The real thing!\\n\"We\\'ve got it,\" said Tuppence. \"At last....\"\\nThe moment was almost breathless in its emotion. Forgotten the\\nfaint creakings, the imagined noises of a minute ago. None of\\nthem had eyes for anything but what Jane held in her hand.\\nSir James took it, and scrutinized it attentively.\\n\"Yes,\" he said quietly, \"this is the ill-fated draft treaty!\"\\n\"We\\'ve succeeded,\" said Tuppence. There was awe and an almost\\nwondering unbelief in her voice.\\nSir James echoed her words as he folded the paper carefully and\\nput it away in his pocket-book, then he looked curiously round\\nthe dingy room.\\n\"It was here that our young friend was confined for so long, was\\nit not?\" he said. \"A truly sinister room. You notice the\\nabsence of windows, and the thickness of the close-fitting door.\\nWhatever took place here would never be heard by the outside\\nworld.\"\\nTuppence shivered. His words woke a vague alarm in her. What if\\nthere WAS some one concealed in the house? Some one who might bar\\nthat door on them, and leave them to die like rats in a trap?\\nThen she realized the absurdity of her thought. The house was\\nsurrounded by police who, if they failed to reappear, would not\\nhesitate to break in and make a thorough search. She smiled at\\nher own foolishness--then looked up with a start to find Sir\\nJames watching her. He gave her an emphatic little nod.\\n\"Quite right, Miss Tuppence. You scent danger. So do I. So does\\nMiss Finn.\"\\n\"Yes,\" admitted Jane. \"It\\'s absurd--but I can\\'t help it.\"\\nSir James nodded again.\\n\"You feel--as we all feel--THE PRESENCE OF MR. BROWN. Yes\"--as\\nTuppence made a movement--\"not a doubt of it--MR. BROWN IS\\nHERE....\"\\n\"In this house?\"\\n\"In this room.... You don\\'t understand? I AM MR. BROWN....\"\\nStupefied, unbelieving, they stared at him. The very lines of\\nhis face had changed. It was a different man who stood before\\nthem. He smiled a slow cruel smile.\\n\"Neither of you will leave this room alive! You said just now we\\nhad succeeded. I have succeeded! The draft treaty is mine.\" His\\nsmile grew wider as he looked at Tuppence. \"Shall I tell you how\\nit will be? Sooner or later the police will break in, and they\\nwill find three victims of Mr. Brown--three, not two, you\\nunderstand, but fortunately the third will not be dead, only\\nwounded, and will be able to describe the attack with a wealth of\\ndetail! The treaty? It is in the hands of Mr. Brown. So no one\\nwill think of searching the pockets of Sir James Peel Edgerton!\"\\nHe turned to Jane.\\n\"You outwitted me. I make my acknowledgments. But you will not\\ndo it again.\"\\nThere was a faint sound behind him, but, intoxicated with\\nsuccess, he did not turn his head.\\nHe slipped his hand into his pocket.\\n\"Checkmate to the Young Adventurers,\" he said, and slowly raised\\nthe big automatic.\\nBut, even as he did so, he felt himself seized from behind in a\\ngrip of iron. The revolver was wrenched from his hand, and the\\nvoice of Julius Hersheimmer said drawlingly:\\n\"I guess you\\'re caught redhanded with the goods upon you.\"\\nThe blood rushed to the K.C.\\'s face, but his self-control was\\nmarvellous, as he looked from one to the other of his two\\ncaptors. He looked longest at Tommy.\\n\"You,\" he said beneath his breath. \"YOU! I might have known.\"\\nSeeing that he was disposed to offer no resistance, their grip\\nslackened. Quick as a flash his left hand, the hand which bore\\nthe big signet ring, was raised to his lips....\\n\" \\'Ave, Caesar! te morituri salutant,\\' \" he said, still looking\\nat Tommy.\\nThen his face changed, and with a long convulsive shudder he fell\\nforward in a crumpled heap, whilst an odour of bitter almonds\\nfilled the air.\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\nA SUPPER PARTY AT THE SAVOY\\nTHE supper party given by Mr. Julius Hersheimmer to a few friends\\non the evening of the 30th will long be remembered in catering\\ncircles. It took place in a private room, and Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s\\norders were brief and forcible. He gave carte blanche--and when\\na millionaire gives carte blanche he usually gets it!\\nEvery delicacy out of season was duly provided. Waiters carried\\nbottles of ancient and royal vintage with loving care. The floral\\ndecorations defied the seasons, and fruits of the earth as far\\napart as May and November found themselves miraculously side by\\nside. The list of guests was small and select. The American\\nAmbassador, Mr. Carter, who had taken the liberty, he said, of\\nbringing an old friend, Sir William Beresford, with him,\\nArchdeacon Cowley, Dr. Hall, those two youthful adventurers, Miss\\nPrudence Cowley and Mr. Thomas Beresford, and last, but not\\nleast, as guest of honour, Miss Jane Finn.\\nJulius had spared no pains to make Jane\\'s appearance a success. A\\nmysterious knock had brought Tuppence to the door of the\\napartment she was sharing with the American girl. It was Julius.\\nIn his hand he held a cheque.\\n\"Say, Tuppence,\" he began, \"will you do me a good turn? Take\\nthis, and get Jane regularly togged up for this evening. You\\'re\\nall coming to supper with me at the Savoy. See? Spare no\\nexpense. You get me?\"\\n\"Sure thing,\" mimicked Tuppence. \"We shall enjoy ourselves. It\\nwill be a pleasure dressing Jane. She\\'s the loveliest thing I\\'ve\\never seen.\"\\n\"That\\'s so,\" agreed Mr. Hersheimmer fervently.\\nHis fervour brought a momentary twinkle to Tuppence\\'s eye.\\n\"By the way, Julius,\" she remarked demurely, \"I--haven\\'t given\\nyou my answer yet.\"\\n\"Answer?\" said Julius. His face paled.\\n\"You know--when you asked me to--marry you,\" faltered Tuppence,\\nher eyes downcast in the true manner of the early Victorian\\nheroine, \"and wouldn\\'t take no for an answer. I\\'ve thought it\\nwell over----\"\\n\"Yes?\" said Julius. The perspiration stood on his forehead.\\nTuppence relented suddenly.\\n\"You great idiot!\" she said. \"What on earth induced you to do\\nit? I could see at the time you didn\\'t care a twopenny dip for\\nme!\"\\n\"Not at all. I had--and still have--the highest sentiments of\\nesteem and respect--and admiration for you----\"\\n\"H\\'m!\" said Tuppence. \"Those are the kind of sentiments that\\nvery soon go to the wall when the other sentiment comes along!\\nDon\\'t they, old thing?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know what you mean,\" said Julius stiffly, but a large\\nand burning blush overspread his countenance.\\n\"Shucks!\" retorted Tuppence. She laughed, and closed the door,\\nreopening it to add with dignity: \"Morally, I shall always\\nconsider I have been jilted!\"\\n\"What was it?\" asked Jane as Tuppence rejoined her.\\n\"Julius.\"\\n\"What did he want?\"\\n\"Really, I think, he wanted to see you, but I wasn\\'t going to let\\nhim. Not until to-night, when you\\'re going to burst upon every\\none like King Solomon in his glory! Come on! WE\\'RE GOING TO\\nSHOP!\"\\nTo most people the 29th, the much-heralded \"Labour Day,\" had\\npassed much as any other day. Speeches were made in the Park and\\nTrafalgar Square. Straggling processions, singing the Red Flag,\\nwandered through the streets in a more or less aimless manner.\\nNewspapers which had hinted at a general strike, and the\\ninauguration of a reign of terror, were forced to hide their\\ndiminished heads. The bolder and more astute among them sought to\\nprove that peace had been effected by following their counsels.\\nIn the Sunday papers a brief notice of the sudden death of Sir\\nJames Peel Edgerton, the famous K.C., had appeared. Monday\\'s\\npaper dealt appreciatively with the dead man\\'s career. The exact\\nmanner of his sudden death was never made public.\\nTommy had been right in his forecast of the situation. It had\\nbeen a one-man show. Deprived of their chief, the organization\\nfell to pieces. Kramenin had made a precipitate return to Russia,\\nleaving England early on Sunday morning. The gang had fled from\\nAstley Priors in a panic, leaving behind, in their haste, various\\ndamaging documents which compromised them hopelessly. With these\\nproofs of conspiracy in their hands, aided further by a small\\nbrown diary taken from the pocket of the dead man which had\\ncontained a full and damning resume of the whole plot, the\\nGovernment had called an eleventh-hour conference. The Labour\\nleaders were forced to recognize that they had been used as a\\ncat\\'s paw. Certain concessions were made by the Government, and\\nwere eagerly accepted. It was to be Peace, not War!\\nBut the Cabinet knew by how narrow a margin they had escaped\\nutter disaster. And burnt in on Mr. Carter\\'s brain was the\\nstrange scene which had taken place in the house in Soho the\\nnight before.\\nHe had entered the squalid room to find that great man, the\\nfriend of a lifetime, dead--betrayed out of his own mouth. From\\nthe dead man\\'s pocket-book he had retrieved the ill-omened draft\\ntreaty, and then and there, in the presence of the other three,\\nit had been reduced to ashes.... England was saved!\\nAnd now, on the evening of the 30th, in a private room at the\\nSavoy, Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was receiving his guests.\\nMr. Carter was the first to arrive. With him was a\\ncholeric-looking old gentleman, at sight of whom Tommy flushed up\\nto the roots of his hair. He came forward.\\n\"Ha!\" said the old gentleman, surveying him apoplectically. \"So\\nyou\\'re my nephew, are you? Not much to look at--but you\\'ve done\\ngood work, it seems. Your mother must have brought you up well\\nafter all. Shall we let bygones be bygones, eh? You\\'re my heir,\\nyou know; and in future I propose to make you an allowance--and\\nyou can look upon Chalmers Park as your home.\"\\n\"Thank you, sir, it\\'s awfully decent of you.\"\\n\"Where\\'s this young lady I\\'ve been hearing such a lot about?\"\\nTommy introduced Tuppence.\\n\"Ha!\" said Sir William, eyeing her. \"Girls aren\\'t what they used\\nto be in my young days.\"\\n\"Yes, they are,\" said Tuppence. \"Their clothes are different,\\nperhaps, but they themselves are just the same.\"\\n\"Well, perhaps you\\'re right. Minxes then--minxes now!\"\\n\"That\\'s it,\" said Tuppence. \"I\\'m a frightful minx myself.\"\\n\"I believe you,\" said the old gentleman, chuckling, and pinched\\nher ear in high good-humour. Most young women were terrified of\\nthe \"old bear,\" as they termed him. Tuppence\\'s pertness\\ndelighted the old misogynist.\\nThen came the timid archdeacon, a little bewildered by the\\ncompany in which he found himself, glad that his daughter was\\nconsidered to have distinguished herself, but unable to help\\nglancing at her from time to time with nervous apprehension. But\\nTuppence behaved admirably. She forbore to cross her legs, set a\\nguard upon her tongue, and steadfastly refused to smoke.\\nDr. Hall came next, and he was followed by the American\\nAmbassador.\\n\"We might as well sit down,\" said Julius, when he had introduced\\nall his guests to each other. \"Tuppence, will you \"\\nHe indicated the place of honour with a wave of his hand.\\nBut Tuppence shook her head.\\n\"No--that\\'s Jane\\'s place! When one thinks of how she\\'s held out\\nall these years, she ought to be made the queen of the feast\\nto-night.\"\\nJulius flung her a grateful glance, and Jane came forward shyly\\nto the allotted seat. Beautiful as she had seemed before, it was\\nas nothing to the loveliness that now went fully adorned.\\nTuppence had performed her part faithfully. The model gown\\nsupplied by a famous dressmaker had been entitled \"A tiger lily.\"\\nIt was all golds and reds and browns, and out of it rose the pure\\ncolumn of the girl\\'s white throat, and the bronze masses of hair\\nthat crowned her lovely head. There was admiration in every eye,\\nas she took her seat.\\nSoon the supper party was in full swing, and with one accord\\nTommy was called upon for a full and complete explanation.\\n\"You\\'ve been too darned close about the whole business,\" Julius\\naccused him. \"You let on to me that you were off to the\\nArgentine--though I guess you had your reasons for that. The idea\\nof both you and Tuppence casting me for the part of Mr. Brown\\njust tickles me to death!\"\\n\"The idea was not original to them,\" said Mr. Carter gravely. \"It\\nwas suggested, and the poison very carefully instilled, by a\\npast-master in the art. The paragraph in the New York paper\\nsuggested the plan to him, and by means of it he wove a web that\\nnearly enmeshed you fatally.\"\\n\"I never liked him,\" said Julius. \"I felt from the first that\\nthere was something wrong about him, and I always suspected that\\nit was he who silenced Mrs. Vandemeyer so appositely. But it\\nwasn\\'t till I heard that the order for Tommy\\'s execution came\\nright on the heels of our interview with him that Sunday that I\\nbegan to tumble to the fact that he was the big bug himself.\"\\n\"I never suspected it at all,\" lamented Tuppence. \"I\\'ve always\\nthought I was so much cleverer than Tommy--but he\\'s undoubtedly\\nscored over me handsomely.\"\\nJulius agreed.\\n\"Tommy\\'s been the goods this trip! And, instead of sitting there\\nas dumb as a fish, let him banish his blushes, and tell us all\\nabout it.\"\\n\"Hear! hear!\"\\n\"There\\'s nothing to tell,\" said Tommy, acutely uncomfortable. \"I\\nwas an awful mug--right up to the time I found that photograph of\\nAnnette, and realized that she was Jane Finn. Then I remembered\\nhow persistently she had shouted out that word \\'Marguerite\\'--and\\nI thought of the pictures, and--well, that\\'s that. Then of course\\nI went over the whole thing to see where I\\'d made an ass of\\nmyself.\"\\n\"Go on,\" said Mr. Carter, as Tommy showed signs of taking refuge\\nin silence once more.\\n\"That business about Mrs. Vandemeyer had worried me when Julius\\ntold me about it. On the face of it, it seemed that he or Sir\\nJames must have done the trick. But I didn\\'t know which.\\nFinding that photograph in the drawer, after that story of how it\\nhad been got from him by Inspector Brown, made me suspect Julius.\\nThen I remembered that it was Sir James who had discovered the\\nfalse Jane Finn. In the end, I couldn\\'t make up my mind--and\\njust decided to take no chances either way. I left a note for\\nJulius, in case he was Mr. Brown, saying I was off to the\\nArgentine, and I dropped Sir James\\'s letter with the offer of the\\njob by the desk so that he would see it was a genuine stunt.\\nThen I wrote my letter to Mr. Carter and rang up Sir James.\\nTaking him into my confidence would be the best thing either way,\\nso I told him everything except where I believed the papers to be\\nhidden. The way he helped me to get on the track of Tuppence and\\nAnnette almost disarmed me, but not quite. I kept my mind open\\nbetween the two of them. And then I got a bogus note from\\nTuppence--and I knew!\"\\n\"But how?\"\\nTommy took the note in question from his pocket and passed it\\nround the table.\\n\"It\\'s her handwriting all right, but I knew it wasn\\'t from her\\nbecause of the signature. She\\'d never spell her name \\'Twopence,\\'\\nbut anyone who\\'d never seen it written might quite easily do so.\\nJulius HAD seen it--he showed me a note of hers to him once--but\\nSIR JAMES HADN\\'T! After that everything was plain sailing. I sent\\noff Albert post-haste to Mr. Carter. I pretended to go away, but\\ndoubled back again. When Julius came bursting up in his car, I\\nfelt it wasn\\'t part of Mr. Brown\\'s plan--and that there would\\nprobably be trouble. Unless Sir James was actually caught in the\\nact, so to speak, I knew Mr. Carter would never believe it of him\\non my bare word----\"\\n\"I didn\\'t,\" interposed Mr. Carter ruefully.\\n\"That\\'s why I sent the girls off to Sir James. I was sure they\\'d\\nfetch up at the house in Soho sooner or later. I threatened\\nJulius with the revolver, because I wanted Tuppence to repeat\\nthat to Sir James, so that he wouldn\\'t worry about us. The moment\\nthe girls were out of sight I told Julius to drive like hell for\\nLondon, and as we went along I told him the whole story. We got\\nto the Soho house in plenty of time and met Mr. Carter outside.\\nAfter arranging things with him we went in and hid behind the\\ncurtain in the recess. The policemen had orders to say, if they\\nwere asked, that no one had gone into the house. That\\'s all.\"\\nAnd Tommy came to an abrupt halt.\\nThere was silence for a moment.\\n\"By the way,\" said Julius suddenly, \"you\\'re all wrong about that\\nphotograph of Jane. It WAS taken from me, but I found it again.\"\\n\"Where?\" cried Tuppence.\\n\"In that little safe on the wall in Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s bedroom.\"\\n\"I knew you found something,\" said Tuppence reproachfully. \"To\\ntell you the truth, that\\'s what started me off suspecting you.\\nWhy didn\\'t you say?\"\\n\"I guess I was a mite suspicious too. It had been got away from\\nme once, and I determined I wouldn\\'t let on I\\'d got it until a\\nphotographer had made a dozen copies of it!\"\\n\"We all kept back something or other,\" said Tuppence\\nthoughtfully. \"I suppose secret service work makes you like\\nthat!\"\\nIn the pause that ensued, Mr. Carter took from his pocket a small\\nshabby brown book.\\n\"Beresford has just said that I would not have believed Sir James\\nPeel Edgerton to be guilty unless, so to speak, he was caught in\\nthe act. That is so. Indeed, not until I read the entries in\\nthis little book could I bring myself fully to credit the amazing\\ntruth. This book will pass into the possession of Scotland Yard,\\nbut it will never be publicly exhibited. Sir James\\'s long\\nassociation with the law would make it undesirable. But to you,\\nwho know the truth, I propose to read certain passages which will\\nthrow some light on the extraordinary mentality of this great\\nman.\"\\nHe opened the book, and turned the thin pages.\\n\". . . It is madness to keep this book. I know that. It is\\ndocumentary evidence against me. But I have never shrunk from\\ntaking risks. And I feel an urgent need for self-expression....\\nThe book will only be taken from my dead body....\\n\". . . From an early age I realized that I had exceptional\\nabilities. Only a fool underestimates his capabilities. My brain\\npower was greatly above the average. I know that I was born to\\nsucceed. My appearance was the only thing against me. I was\\nquiet and insignificant--utterly nondescript....\\n\". . . When I was a boy I heard a famous murder trial. I was\\ndeeply impressed by the power and eloquence of the counsel for\\nthe defence. For the first time I entertained the idea of taking\\nmy talents to that particular market.... Then I studied the\\ncriminal in the dock.... The man was a fool--he had been\\nincredibly, unbelievably stupid. Even the eloquence of his\\ncounsel was hardly likely to save him. I felt an immeasurable\\ncontempt for him.... Then it occurred to me that the criminal\\nstandard was a low one. It was the wastrels, the failures, the\\ngeneral riff-raff of civilization who drifted into crime....\\nStrange that men of brains had never realized its extraordinary\\nopportunities.... I played with the idea.... What a magnificent\\nfield--what unlimited possibilities! It made my brain reel....\\n\". . . I read standard works on crime and criminals. They all\\nconfirmed my opinion. Degeneracy, disease--never the deliberate\\nembracing of a career by a far-seeing man. Then I considered.\\nSupposing my utmost ambitions were realized--that I was called to\\nthe bar, and rose to the height of my profession? That I entered\\npolitics--say, even, that I became Prime Minister of England?\\nWhat then? Was that power? Hampered at every turn by my\\ncolleagues, fettered by the democratic system of which I should\\nbe the mere figurehead! No--the power I dreamed of was absolute!\\nAn autocrat! A dictator! And such power could only be obtained\\nby working outside the law. To play on the weaknesses of human\\nnature, then on the weaknesses of nations--to get together and\\ncontrol a vast organization, and finally to overthrow the\\nexisting order, and rule! The thought intoxicated me....\\n\". . . I saw that I must lead two lives. A man like myself is\\nbound to attract notice. I must have a successful career which\\nwould mask my true activities.... Also I must cultivate a\\npersonality. I modelled myself upon famous K.C.\\'s. I reproduced\\ntheir mannerisms, their magnetism. If I had chosen to be an\\nactor, I should have been the greatest actor living! No\\ndisguises--no grease paint--no false beards! Personality! I put\\nit on like a glove! When I shed it, I was myself, quiet,\\nunobtrusive, a man like every other man. I called myself Mr.\\nBrown. There are hundreds of men called Brown--there are\\nhundreds of men looking just like me....\\n\". . . I succeeded in my false career. I was bound to succeed. I\\nshall succeed in the other. A man like me cannot fail....\\n\". . . I have been reading a life of Napoleon. He and I have\\nmuch in common....\\n\". . . I make a practice of defending criminals. A man should\\nlook after his own people....\\n\". . . Once or twice I have felt afraid. The first time was in\\nItaly. There was a dinner given. Professor D----, the great\\nalienist, was present. The talk fell on insanity. He said, \\'A\\ngreat many men are mad, and no one knows it. They do not know it\\nthemselves.\\' I do not understand why he looked at me when he\\nsaid that. His glance was strange.... I did not like it....\\n\". . . The war has disturbed me.... I thought it would further my\\nplans. The Germans are so efficient. Their spy system, too, was\\nexcellent. The streets are full of these boys in khaki. All\\nempty-headed young fools.... Yet I do not know.... They won the\\nwar.... It disturbs me....\\n\". . . My plans are going well.... A girl butted in--I do not\\nthink she really knew anything.... But we must give up the\\nEsthonia.... No risks now....\\n\". . . . All goes well. The loss of memory is vexing. It cannot\\nbe a fake. No girl could deceive ME! . . .\\n\". . .The 29th.... That is very soon....\" Mr. Carter paused.\\n\"I will not read the details of the coup that was planned. But\\nthere are just two small entries that refer to the three of you.\\nIn the light of what happened they are interesting.\\n\". . . By inducing the girl to come to me of her own accord, I\\nhave succeeded in disarming her. But she has intuitive flashes\\nthat might be dangerous.... She must be got out of the way.... I\\ncan do nothing with the American. He suspects and dislikes me.\\nBut he cannot know. I fancy my armour is impregnable....\\nSometimes I fear I have underestimated the other boy. He is not\\nclever, but it is hard to blind his eyes to facts....\"\\nMr. Carter shut the book.\\n\"A great man,\" he said. \"Genius, or insanity, who can say?\"\\nThere was silence.\\nThen Mr. Carter rose to his feet.\\n\"I will give you a toast. The Joint Venture which has so amply\\njustified itself by success!\"\\nIt was drunk with acclamation.\\n\"There\\'s something more we want to hear,\" continued Mr. Carter.\\nHe looked at the American Ambassador. \"I speak for you also, I\\nknow. We\\'ll ask Miss Jane Finn to tell us the story that only\\nMiss Tuppence has heard so far--but before we do so we\\'ll drink\\nher health. The health of one of the bravest of America\\'s\\ndaughters, to whom is due the thanks and gratitude of two great\\ncountries!\"\\nCHAPTER XXVIII\\nAND AFTER\\n\"THAT was a mighty good toast, Jane,\" said Mr. Hersheimmer, as he\\nand his cousin were being driven back in the Rolls-Royce to the\\nRitz.\\n\"The one to the joint venture?\"\\n\"No--the one to you. There isn\\'t another girl in the world who\\ncould have carried it through as you did. You were just\\nwonderful!\"\\nJane shook her head.\\n\"I don\\'t feel wonderful. At heart I\\'m just tired and\\nlonesome--and longing for my own country.\"\\n\"That brings me to something I wanted to say. I heard the\\nAmbassador telling you his wife hoped you would come to them at\\nthe Embassy right away. That\\'s good enough, but I\\'ve got another\\nplan. Jane--I want you to marry me! Don\\'t get scared and say no\\nat once. You can\\'t love me right away, of course, that\\'s\\nimpossible. But I\\'ve loved you from the very moment I set eyes\\non your photo--and now I\\'ve seen you I\\'m simply crazy about you!\\nIf you\\'ll only marry me, I won\\'t worry you any--you shall take\\nyour own time. Maybe you\\'ll never come to love me, and if that\\'s\\nthe case I\\'ll manage to set you free. But I want the right to\\nlook after you, and take care of you.\"\\n\"That\\'s what I want,\" said the girl wistfully. \"Some one who\\'ll\\nbe good to me. Oh, you don\\'t know how lonesome I feel!\"\\n\"Sure thing I do. Then I guess that\\'s all fixed up, and I\\'ll see\\nthe archbishop about a special license to-morrow morning.\"\\n\"Oh, Julius!\"\\n\"Well, I don\\'t want to hustle you any, Jane, but there\\'s no sense\\nin waiting about. Don\\'t be scared--I shan\\'t expect you to love\\nme all at once.\"\\nBut a small hand was slipped into his.\\n\"I love you now, Julius,\" said Jane Finn. \"I loved you that\\nfirst moment in the car when the bullet grazed your cheek....\"\\nFive minutes later Jane murmured softly:\\n\"I don\\'t know London very well, Julius, but is it such a very\\nlong way from the Savoy to the Ritz?\"\\n\"It depends how you go,\" explained Julius unblushingly. \"We\\'re\\ngoing by way of Regent\\'s Park!\"\\n\"Oh, Julius--what will the chauffeur think?\"\\n\"At the wages I pay him, he knows better than to do any\\nindependent thinking. Why, Jane, the only reason I had the\\nsupper at the Savoy was so that I could drive you home. I didn\\'t\\nsee how I was ever going to get hold of you alone. You and\\nTuppence have been sticking together like Siamese twins. I guess\\nanother day of it would have driven me and Beresford stark\\nstaring mad!\"\\n\"Oh. Is he----?\"\\n\"Of course he is. Head over ears.\"\\n\"I thought so,\" said Jane thoughtfully.\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"From all the things Tuppence didn\\'t say!\"\\n\"There you have me beat,\" said Mr. Hersheimmer. But Jane only\\nlaughed.\\nIn the meantime, the Young Adventurers were sitting bolt upright,\\nvery stiff and ill at ease, in a taxi which, with a singular lack\\nof originality, was also returning to the Ritz via Regent\\'s Park.\\nA terrible constraint seemed to have settled down between them.\\nWithout quite knowing what had happened, everything seemed\\nchanged. They were tongue-tied--paralysed. All the old\\ncamaraderie was gone.\\nTuppence could think of nothing to say.\\nTommy was equally afflicted.\\nThey sat very straight and forbore to look at each other.\\nAt last Tuppence made a desperate effort.\\n\"Rather fun, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\"Rather.\"\\nAnother silence.\\n\"I like Julius,\" essayed Tuppence again.\\nTommy was suddenly galvanized into life.\\n\"You\\'re not going to marry him, do you hear?\" he said\\ndictatorially. \"I forbid it.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence meekly.\\n\"Absolutely, you understand.\"\\n\"He doesn\\'t want to marry me--he really only asked me out of\\nkindness.\"\\n\"That\\'s not very likely,\" scoffed Tommy.\\n\"It\\'s quite true. He\\'s head over ears in love with Jane. I\\nexpect he\\'s proposing to her now.\"\\n\"She\\'ll do for him very nicely,\" said Tommy condescendingly.\\n\"Don\\'t you think she\\'s the most lovely creature you\\'ve ever\\nseen?\"\\n\"Oh, I dare say.\"\\n\"But I suppose you prefer sterling worth,\" said Tuppence\\ndemurely.\\n\"I--oh, dash it all, Tuppence, you know!\"\\n\"I like your uncle, Tommy,\" said Tuppence, hastily creating a\\ndiversion. \"By the way, what are you going to do, accept Mr.\\nCarter\\'s offer of a Government job, or accept Julius\\'s invitation\\nand take a richly remunerated post in America on his ranch?\"\\n\"I shall stick to the old ship, I think, though it\\'s awfully good\\nof Hersheimmer. But I feel you\\'d be more at home in London.\"\\n\"I don\\'t see where I come in.\"\\n\"I do,\" said Tommy positively.\\nTuppence stole a glance at him sideways.\\n\"There\\'s the money, too,\" she observed thoughtfully.\\n\"What money?\"\\n\"We\\'re going to get a cheque each. Mr. Carter told me so.\"\\n\"Did you ask how much?\" inquired Tommy sarcastically.\\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence triumphantly. \"But I shan\\'t tell you.\"\\n\"Tuppence, you are the limit!\"\\n\"It has been fun, hasn\\'t it, Tommy? I do hope we shall have lots\\nmore adventures.\"\\n\"You\\'re insatiable, Tuppence. I\\'ve had quite enough adventures\\nfor the present.\"\\n\"Well, shopping is almost as good,\" said Tuppence dreamily.\\n\"Think of buying old furniture, and bright carpets, and futurist\\nsilk curtains, and a polished dining-table, and a divan with lots\\nof cushions.\"\\n\"Hold hard,\" said Tommy. \"What\\'s all this for?\"\\n\"Possibly a house--but I think a flat.\"\\n\"Whose flat?\"\\n\"You think I mind saying it, but I don\\'t in the least! OURS, so\\nthere!\"\\n\"You darling!\" cried Tommy, his arms tightly round her. \"I was\\ndetermined to make you say it. I owe you something for the\\nrelentless way you\\'ve squashed me whenever I\\'ve tried to be\\nsentimental.\"\\nTuppence raised her face to his. The taxi proceeded on its\\ncourse round the north side of Regent\\'s Park.\\n\"You haven\\'t really proposed now,\" pointed out Tuppence. \"Not\\nwhat our grandmothers would call a proposal. But after listening\\nto a rotten one like Julius\\'s, I\\'m inclined to let you off.\"\\n\"You won\\'t be able to get out of marrying me, so don\\'t you think\\nit.\"\\n\"What fun it will be,\" responded Tuppence. \"Marriage is called\\nall sorts of things, a haven, and a refuge, and a crowning glory,\\nand a state of bondage, and lots more. But do you know what I\\nthink it is?\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"A sport!\"\\n\"And a damned good sport too,\" said Tommy.\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s Etext of Secret Adversary by Agatha Christie'"
