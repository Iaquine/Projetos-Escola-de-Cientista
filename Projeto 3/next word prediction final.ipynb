              "'PROLOGUE\\nIT was 2 p.m. on the afternoon of May 7, 1915. The Lusitania had\\nbeen struck by two torpedoes in succession and was sinking\\nrapidly, while the boats were being launched with all possible\\nspeed. The women and children were being lined up awaiting their\\nturn. Some still clung desperately to husbands and fathers;\\nothers clutched their children closely to their breasts. One girl\\nstood alone, slightly apart from the rest. She was quite young,\\nnot more than eighteen. She did not seem afraid, and her grave,\\nsteadfast eyes looked straight ahead.\\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\\nA man\\'s voice beside her made her start and turn. She had\\nnoticed the speaker more than once amongst the first-class\\npassengers. There had been a hint of mystery about him which had\\nappealed to her imagination. He spoke to no one. If anyone spoke\\nto him he was quick to rebuff the overture. Also he had a nervous\\nway of looking over his shoulder with a swift, suspicious glance.\\nShe noticed now that he was greatly agitated. There were beads\\nof perspiration on his brow. He was evidently in a state of\\novermastering fear. And yet he did not strike her as the kind of\\nman who would be afraid to meet death!\\n\"Yes?\" Her grave eyes met his inquiringly.\\nHe stood looking at her with a kind of desperate irresolution.\\n\"It must be!\" he muttered to himself. \"Yes--it is the only way.\"\\nThen aloud he said abruptly: \"You are an American?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"A patriotic one?\"\\nThe girl flushed.\\n\"I guess you\\'ve no right to ask such a thing! Of course I am!\"\\n\"Don\\'t be offended. You wouldn\\'t be if you knew how much there\\nwas at stake. But I\\'ve got to trust some one--and it must be a\\nwoman.\"\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Because of \\'women and children first.\\' \" He looked round and\\nlowered his voice. \"I\\'m carrying papers--vitally important\\npapers. They may make all the difference to the Allies in the\\nwar. You understand? These papers have GOT to be saved! They\\'ve\\nmore chance with you than with me. Will you take them?\"\\nThe girl held out her hand.\\n\"Wait--I must warn you. There may be a risk--if I\\'ve been\\nfollowed. I don\\'t think I have, but one never knows. If so,\\nthere will be danger. Have you the nerve to go through with it?\"\\nThe girl smiled.\\n\"I\\'ll go through with it all right. And I\\'m real proud to be\\nchosen! What am I to do with them afterwards?\"\\n\"Watch the newspapers! I\\'ll advertise in the personal column of\\nthe Times, beginning \\'Shipmate.\\' At the end of three days if\\nthere\\'s nothing--well, you\\'ll know I\\'m down and out. Then take\\nthe packet to the American Embassy, and deliver it into the\\nAmbassador\\'s own hands. Is that clear?\"\\n\"Quite clear.\"\\n\"Then be ready--I\\'m going to say good-bye.\" He took her hand in\\nhis. \"Good-bye. Good luck to you,\" he said in a louder tone.\\nHer hand closed on the oilskin packet that had lain in his palm.\\nThe Lusitania settled with a more decided list to starboard. In\\nanswer to a quick command, the girl went forward to take her\\nplace in the boat.\\nCHAPTER I\\nTHE YOUNG ADVENTURERS, LTD.\\n\"TOMMY, old thing!\"\\n\"Tuppence, old bean!\"\\nThe two young people greeted each other affectionately, and\\nmomentarily blocked the Dover Street Tube exit in doing so. The\\nadjective \"old\" was misleading. Their united ages would\\ncertainly not have totalled forty-five.\\n\"Not seen you for simply centuries,\" continued the young man.\\n\"Where are you off to? Come and chew a bun with me. We\\'re\\ngetting a bit unpopular here--blocking the gangway as it were.\\nLet\\'s get out of it.\"\\nThe girl assenting, they started walking down Dover Street\\ntowards Piccadilly.\\n\"Now then,\" said Tommy, \"where shall we go?\"\\nThe very faint anxiety which underlay his tone did not escape the\\nastute ears of Miss Prudence Cowley, known to her intimate\\nfriends for some mysterious reason as \"Tuppence.\" She pounced at\\nonce.\\n\"Tommy, you\\'re stony!\"\\n\"Not a bit of it,\" declared Tommy unconvincingly. \"Rolling in\\ncash.\"\\n\"You always were a shocking liar,\" said Tuppence severely,\\n\"though you did once persuade Sister Greenbank that the doctor\\nhad ordered you beer as a tonic, but forgotten to write it on the\\nchart. Do you remember?\"\\nTommy chuckled.\\n\"I should think I did! Wasn\\'t the old cat in a rage when she\\nfound out? Not that she was a bad sort really, old Mother\\nGreenbank! Good old hospital--demobbed like everything else, I\\nsuppose?\"\\nTuppence sighed.\\n\"Yes. You too?\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"Two months ago.\"\\n\"Gratuity?\" hinted Tuppence.\\n\"Spent.\"\\n\"Oh, Tommy!\"\\n\"No, old thing, not in riotous dissipation. No such luck! The\\ncost of living--ordinary plain, or garden living nowadays is, I\\nassure you, if you do not know----\"\\n\"My dear child,\" interrupted Tuppence, \"there is nothing I do NOT\\nknow about the cost of living. Here we are at Lyons\\', and we\\nwill each of us pay for our own. That\\'s it!\" And Tuppence led\\nthe way upstairs.\\nThe place was full, and they wandered about looking for a table,\\ncatching odds and ends of conversation as they did so.\\n\"And--do you know, she sat down and CRIED when I told her she\\ncouldn\\'t have the flat after all.\" \"It was simply a BARGAIN, my\\ndear! Just like the one Mabel Lewis brought from Paris----\"\\n\"Funny scraps one does overhear,\" murmured Tommy. \"I passed two\\nJohnnies in the street to-day talking about some one called Jane\\nFinn. Did you ever hear such a name?\"\\nBut at that moment two elderly ladies rose and collected parcels,\\nand Tuppence deftly ensconced herself in one of the vacant seats.\\nTommy ordered tea and buns. Tuppence ordered tea and buttered\\ntoast.\\n\"And mind the tea comes in separate teapots,\" she added severely.\\nTommy sat down opposite her. His bared head revealed a shock of\\nexquisitely slicked-back red hair. His face was pleasantly\\nugly--nondescript, yet unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a\\nsportsman. His brown suit was well cut, but perilously near the\\nend of its tether.\\nThey were an essentially modern-looking couple as they sat there.\\nTuppence had no claim to beauty, but there was character and\\ncharm in the elfin lines of her little face, with its determined\\nchin and large, wide-apart grey eyes that looked mistily out from\\nunder straight, black brows. She wore a small bright green toque\\nover her black bobbed hair, and her extremely short and rather\\nshabby skirt revealed a pair of uncommonly dainty ankles. Her\\nappearance presented a valiant attempt at smartness.\\nThe tea came at last, and Tuppence, rousing herself from a fit of\\nmeditation, poured it out.\\n\"Now then,\" said Tommy, taking a large bite of bun, \"let\\'s get\\nup-to-date. Remember, I haven\\'t seen you since that time in\\nhospital in 1916.\"\\n\"Very well.\" Tuppence helped herself liberally to buttered\\ntoast. \"Abridged biography of Miss Prudence Cowley, fifth\\ndaughter of Archdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell, Suffolk.\\nMiss Cowley left the delights (and drudgeries) of her home life\\nearly in the war and came up to London, where she entered an\\nofficers\\' hospital. First month: Washed up six hundred and\\nforty-eight plates every day. Second month: Promoted to drying\\naforesaid plates. Third month: Promoted to peeling potatoes.\\nFourth month: Promoted to cutting bread and butter. Fifth month:\\nPromoted one floor up to duties of wardmaid with mop and pail.\\nSixth month: Promoted to waiting at table. Seventh month:\\nPleasing appearance and nice manners so striking that am promoted\\nto waiting on the Sisters! Eighth month: Slight check in career.\\nSister Bond ate Sister Westhaven\\'s egg! Grand row! Wardmaid\\nclearly to blame! Inattention in such important matters cannot\\nbe too highly censured. Mop and pail again! How are the mighty\\nfallen! Ninth month: Promoted to sweeping out wards, where I\\nfound a friend of my childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford\\n(bow, Tommy!), whom I had not seen for five long years. The\\nmeeting was affecting! Tenth month: Reproved by matron for\\nvisiting the pictures in company with one of the patients,\\nnamely: the aforementioned Lieutenant Thomas Beresford.\\nEleventh and twelfth months: Parlourmaid duties resumed with\\nentire success. At the end of the year left hospital in a blaze\\nof glory. After that, the talented Miss Cowley drove\\nsuccessively a trade delivery van, a motor-lorry and a general!\"\\nThe last was the pleasantest. He was quite a young general!\"\\n\"What brighter was that?\" inquired Tommy. \"Perfectly sickening\\nthe way those brass hats drove from the War Office to the Savoy,\\nand from the Savoy to the War Office!\"\\n\"I\\'ve forgotten his name now,\" confessed Tuppence. \"To resume,\\nthat was in a way the apex of my career. I next entered a\\nGovernment office. We had several very enjoyable tea parties. I\\nhad intended to become a land girl, a postwoman, and a bus\\nconductress by way of rounding off my career--but the Armistice\\nintervened! I clung to the office with the true limpet touch for\\nmany long months, but, alas, I was combed out at last. Since then\\nI\\'ve been looking for a job. Now then--your turn.\"\\n\"There\\'s not so much promotion in mine,\" said Tommy regretfully,\\n\"and a great deal less variety. I went out to France again, as\\nyou know. Then they sent me to Mesopotamia, and I got wounded\\nfor the second time, and went into hospital out there. Then I got\\nstuck in Egypt till the Armistice happened, kicked my heels there\\nsome time longer, and, as I told you, finally got demobbed. And,\\nfor ten long, weary months I\\'ve been job hunting! There aren\\'t\\nany jobs! And, if there were, they wouldn\\'t give \\'em to me. What\\ngood am I? What do I know about business? Nothing.\"\\nTuppence nodded gloomily.\\n\"What about the colonies?\" she suggested.\\nTommy shook his head.\\n\"I shouldn\\'t like the colonies--and I\\'m perfectly certain they\\nwouldn\\'t like me!\"\\n\"Rich relations?\"\\nAgain Tommy shook his head.\\n\"Oh, Tommy, not even a great-aunt?\"\\n\"I\\'ve got an old uncle who\\'s more or less rolling, but he\\'s no\\ngood.\"\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\"Wanted to adopt me once. I refused.\"\\n\"I think I remember hearing about it,\" said Tuppence slowly. \"You\\nrefused because of your mother----\"\\nTommy flushed.\\n\"Yes, it would have been a bit rough on the mater. As you know,\\nI was all she had. Old boy hated her--wanted to get me away from\\nher. Just a bit of spite.\"\\n\"Your mother\\'s dead, isn\\'t she?\" said Tuppence gently.\\nTommy nodded.\\nTuppence\\'s large grey eyes looked misty.\\n\"You\\'re a good sort, Tommy. I always knew it.\"\\n\"Rot!\" said Tommy hastily. \"Well, that\\'s my position. I\\'m just\\nabout desperate.\"\\n\"So am I! I\\'ve hung out as long as I could. I\\'ve touted round.\\nI\\'ve answered advertisements. I\\'ve tried every mortal blessed\\nthing. I\\'ve screwed and saved and pinched! But it\\'s no good. I\\nshall have to go home!\"\\n\"Don\\'t you want to?\"\\n\"Of course I don\\'t want to! What\\'s the good of being\\nsentimental? Father\\'s a dear--I\\'m awfully fond of him--but you\\'ve\\nno idea how I worry him! He has that delightful early Victorian\\nview that short skirts and smoking are immoral. You can imagine\\nwhat a thorn in the flesh I am to him! He just heaved a sigh of\\nrelief when the war took me off. You see, there are seven of us\\nat home. It\\'s awful! All housework and mothers\\' meetings! I\\nhave always been the changeling. I don\\'t want to go back,\\nbut--oh, Tommy, what else is there to do?\"\\nTommy shook his head sadly. There was a silence, and then\\nTuppence burst out:\\n\"Money, money, money! I think about money morning, noon and\\nnight! I dare say it\\'s mercenary of me, but there it is!\"\\n\"Same here,\" agreed Tommy with feeling.\\n\"I\\'ve thought over every imaginable way of getting it too,\"\\ncontinued Tuppence. \"There are only three! To be left it, to\\nmarry it, or to make it. First is ruled out. I haven\\'t got any\\nrich elderly relatives. Any relatives I have are in homes for\\ndecayed gentlewomen! I always help old ladies over crossings,\\nand pick up parcels for old gentlemen, in case they should turn\\nout to be eccentric millionaires. But not one of them has ever\\nasked me my name--and quite a lot never said \\'Thank you.\\' \"\\nThere was a pause.\\n\"Of course,\" resumed Tuppence, \"marriage is my best chance. I\\nmade up my mind to marry money when I was quite young. Any\\nthinking girl would! I\\'m not sentimental, you know.\" She paused.\\n\"Come now, you can\\'t say I\\'m sentimental,\" she added sharply.\\n\"Certainly not,\" agreed Tommy hastily. \"No one would ever think\\nof sentiment in connection with you.\"\\n\"That\\'s not very polite,\" replied Tuppence. \"But I dare say you\\nmean it all right. Well, there it is! I\\'m ready and willing--but\\nI never meet any rich men! All the boys I know are about as hard\\nup as I am.\"\\n\"What about the general?\" inquired Tommy.\\n\"I fancy he keeps a bicycle shop in time of peace,\" explained\\nTuppence. \"No, there it is! Now you could marry a rich girl.\"\\n\"I\\'m like you. I don\\'t know any.\"\\n\"That doesn\\'t matter. You can always get to know one. Now, if I\\nsee a man in a fur coat come out of the Ritz I can\\'t rush up to\\nhim and say: \\'Look here, you\\'re rich. I\\'d like to know you.\\' \"\\n\"Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed\\nfemale?\"\\n\"Don\\'t be silly. You tread on her foot, or pick up her\\nhandkerchief, or something like that. If she thinks you want to\\nknow her she\\'s flattered, and will manage it for you somehow.\"\\n\"You overrate my manly charms,\" murmured Tommy.\\n\"On the other hand,\" proceeded Tuppence, \"my millionaire would\\nprobably run for his life! No--marriage is fraught with\\ndifficulties. Remains--to MAKE money!\"\\n\"We\\'ve tried that, and failed,\" Tommy reminded her.\\n\"We\\'ve tried all the orthodox ways, yes. But suppose we try the\\nunorthodox. Tommy, let\\'s be adventurers!\"\\n\"Certainly,\" replied Tommy cheerfully. \"How do we begin?\"\\n\"That\\'s the difficulty. If we could make ourselves known, people\\nmight hire us to commit crimes for them.\"\\n\"Delightful,\" commented Tommy. \"Especially coming from a\\nclergyman\\'s daughter!\"\\n\"The moral guilt,\" Tuppence pointed out, \"would be theirs--not\\nmine. You must admit that there\\'s a difference between stealing a\\ndiamond necklace for yourself and being hired to steal it.\"\\n\"There wouldn\\'t be the least difference if you were caught!\"\\n\"Perhaps not. But I shouldn\\'t be caught. I\\'m so clever.\"\\n\"Modesty always was your besetting sin,\" remarked Tommy.\\n\"Don\\'t rag. Look here, Tommy, shall we really? Shall we form a\\nbusiness partnership?\"\\n\"Form a company for the stealing of diamond necklaces?\"\\n\"That was only an illustration. Let\\'s have a--what do you call\\nit in book-keeping?\"\\n\"Don\\'t know. Never did any.\"\\n\"I have--but I always got mixed up, and used to put credit\\nentries on the debit side, and vice versa--so they fired me out.\\nOh, I know--a joint venture! It struck me as such a romantic\\nphrase to come across in the middle of musty old figures. It\\'s\\ngot an Elizabethan flavour about it--makes one think of galleons\\nand doubloons. A joint venture!\"\\n\"Trading under the name of the Young Adventurers, Ltd.? Is that\\nyour idea, Tuppence?\"\\n\"It\\'s all very well to laugh, but I feel there might be something\\nin it.\"\\n\"How do you propose to get in touch with your would-be\\nemployers?\"\\n\"Advertisement,\" replied Tuppence promptly. \"Have you got a bit\\nof paper and a pencil? Men usually seem to have. Just like we\\nhave hairpins and powder-puffs.\"\\nTommy handed over a rather shabby green notebook, and Tuppence\\nbegan writing busily.\\n\"Shall we begin: \\'Young officer, twice wounded in the war--\\' \"\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\n\"Oh, very well, my dear boy. But I can assure you that that sort\\nof thing might touch the heart of an elderly spinster, and she\\nmight adopt you, and then there would be no need for you to be a\\nyoung adventurer at all.\"\\n\"I don\\'t want to be adopted.\"\\n\"I forgot you had a prejudice against it. I was only ragging\\nyou! The papers are full up to the brim with that type of thing.\\nNow listen--how\\'s this? \\'Two young adventurers for hire. Willing\\nto do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good.\\' (We might as\\nwell make that clear from the start.) Then we might add: \\'No\\nreasonable offer refused\\'--like flats and furniture.\"\\n\"I should think any offer we get in answer to that would be a\\npretty UNreasonable one!\"\\n\"Tommy! You\\'re a genius! That\\'s ever so much more chic. \\'No\\nunreasonable offer refused--if pay is good.\\' How\\'s that?\"\\n\"I shouldn\\'t mention pay again. It looks rather eager.\"\\n\"It couldn\\'t look as eager as I feel! But perhaps you are right.\\nNow I\\'ll read it straight through. \\'Two young adventurers for\\nhire. Willing to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. No\\nunreasonable offer refused.\\' How would that strike you if you\\nread it?\"\\n\"It would strike me as either being a hoax, or else written by a\\nlunatic.\"\\n\"It\\'s not half so insane as a thing I read this morning beginning\\n\\'Petunia\\' and signed \\'Best Boy.\\' \" She tore out the leaf and\\nhanded it to Tommy. \"There you are. Times, I think. Reply to\\nBox so-and-so. I expect it will be about five shillings. Here\\'s\\nhalf a crown for my share.\"\\nTommy was holding the paper thoughtfully. His faced burned a\\ndeeper red.\\n\"Shall we really try it?\" he said at last. \"Shall we, Tuppence?\\nJust for the fun of the thing?\"\\n\"Tommy, you\\'re a sport! I knew you would be! Let\\'s drink to\\nsuccess.\" She poured some cold dregs of tea into the two cups.\\n\"Here\\'s to our joint venture, and may it prosper!\"\\n\"The Young Adventurers, Ltd.!\" responded Tommy.\\nThey put down the cups and laughed rather uncertainly. Tuppence\\nrose.\\n\"I must return to my palatial suite at the hostel.\"\\n\"Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the Ritz,\" agreed Tommy\\nwith a grin. \"Where shall we meet? And when?\"\\n\"Twelve o\\'clock to-morrow. Piccadilly Tube station. Will that\\nsuit you?\"\\n\"My time is my own,\" replied Mr. Beresford magnificently.\\n\"So long, then.\"\\n\"Good-bye, old thing.\"\\nThe two young people went off in opposite directions. Tuppence\\'s\\nhostel was situated in what was charitably called Southern\\nBelgravia. For reasons of economy she did not take a bus.\\nShe was half-way across St. James\\'s Park, when a man\\'s voice\\nbehind her made her start.\\n\"Excuse me,\" it said. \"But may I speak to you for a moment?\"\\nCHAPTER II\\nMR. WHITTINGTON\\'S OFFER\\nTUPPENCE turned sharply, but the words hovering on the tip of her\\ntongue remained unspoken, for the man\\'s appearance and manner did\\nnot bear out her first and most natural assumption. She\\nhesitated. As if he read her thoughts, the man said quickly:\\n\"I can assure you I mean no disrespect.\"\\nTuppence believed him. Although she disliked and distrusted him\\ninstinctively, she was inclined to acquit him of the particular\\nmotive which she had at first attributed to him. She looked him\\nup and down. He was a big man, clean shaven, with a heavy jowl.\\nHis eyes were small and cunning, and shifted their glance under\\nher direct gaze.\\n\"Well, what is it?\" she asked.\\nThe man smiled.\\n\"I happened to overhear part of your conversation with the young\\ngentleman in Lyons\\'.\"\\n\"Well--what of it?\"\\n\"Nothing--except that I think I may be of some use to you.\"\\nAnother inference forced itself into Tuppence\\'s mind:\\n\"You followed me here?\"\\n\"I took that liberty.\"\\n\"And in what way do you think you could be of use to me?\"\\nThe man took a card from his pocket and handed it to her with a\\nbow.\\nTuppence took it and scrutinized it carefully. It bore the\\ninscription, \"Mr. Edward Whittington.\" Below the name were the\\nwords \"Esthonia Glassware Co.,\" and the address of a city office.\\nMr. Whittington spoke again:\\n\"If you will call upon me to-morrow morning at eleven o\\'clock, I\\nwill lay the details of my proposition before you.\"\\n\"At eleven o\\'clock?\" said Tuppence doubtfully.\\n\"At eleven o\\'clock.\"\\nTuppence made up her mind.\\n\"Very well. I\\'ll be there.\"\\n\"Thank you. Good evening.\"\\nHe raised his hat with a flourish, and walked away. Tuppence\\nremained for some minutes gazing after him. Then she gave a\\ncurious movement of her shoulders, rather as a terrier shakes\\nhimself.\\n\"The adventures have begun,\" she murmured to herself. \"What does\\nhe want me to do, I wonder? There\\'s something about you, Mr.\\nWhittington, that I don\\'t like at all. But, on the other hand,\\nI\\'m not the least bit afraid of you. And as I\\'ve said before, and\\nshall doubtless say again, little Tuppence can look after\\nherself, thank you!\"\\nAnd with a short, sharp nod of her head she walked briskly\\nonward. As a result of further meditations, however, she turned\\naside from the direct route and entered a post office. There she\\npondered for some moments, a telegraph form in her hand. The\\nthought of a possible five shillings spent unnecessarily spurred\\nher to action, and she decided to risk the waste of ninepence.\\nDisdaining the spiky pen and thick, black treacle which a\\nbeneficent Government had provided, Tuppence drew out Tommy\\'s\\npencil which she had retained and wrote rapidly: \"Don\\'t put in\\nadvertisement. Will explain to-morrow.\" She addressed it to Tommy\\nat his club, from which in one short month he would have to\\nresign, unless a kindly fortune permitted him to renew his\\nsubscription.\\n\"It may catch him,\" she murmured. \"Anyway, it\\'s worth trying.\"\\nAfter handing it over the counter she set out briskly for home,\\nstopping at a baker\\'s to buy three penny-worth of new buns.\\nLater, in her tiny cubicle at the top of the house she munched\\nbuns and reflected on the future. What was the Esthonia\\nGlassware Co., and what earthly need could it have for her\\nservices? A pleasurable thrill of excitement made Tuppence\\ntingle. At any rate, the country vicarage had retreated into the\\nbackground again. The morrow held possibilities.\\nIt was a long time before Tuppence went to sleep that night, and,\\nwhen at length she did, she dreamed that Mr. Whittington had set\\nher to washing up a pile of Esthonia Glassware, which bore an\\nunaccountable resemblance to hospital plates!\\nIt wanted some five minutes to eleven when Tuppence reached the\\nblock of buildings in which the offices of the Esthonia Glassware\\nCo. were situated. To arrive before the time would look\\nover-eager. So Tuppence decided to walk to the end of the street\\nand back again. She did so. On the stroke of eleven she plunged\\ninto the recesses of the building. The Esthonia Glassware Co.\\nwas on the top floor. There was a lift, but Tuppence chose to\\nwalk up.\\nSlightly out of breath, she came to a halt outside the ground\\nglass door with the legend painted across it \"Esthonia Glassware\\nCo.\"\\nTuppence knocked. In response to a voice from within, she turned\\nthe handle and walked into a small rather dirty outer office.\\nA middle-aged clerk got down from a high stool at a desk near the\\nwindow and came towards her inquiringly.\\n\"I have an appointment with Mr. Whittington,\" said Tuppence.\\n\"Will you come this way, please.\" He crossed to a partition door\\nwith \"Private\" on it, knocked, then opened the door and stood\\naside to let her pass in.\\nMr. Whittington was seated behind a large desk covered with\\npapers. Tuppence felt her previous judgment confirmed. There was\\nsomething wrong about Mr. Whittington. The combination of his\\nsleek prosperity and his shifty eye was not attractive.\\nHe looked up and nodded.\\n\"So you\\'ve turned up all right? That\\'s good. Sit down, will\\nyou?\"\\nTuppence sat down on the chair facing him. She looked\\nparticularly small and demure this morning. She sat there meekly\\nwith downcast eyes whilst Mr. Whittington sorted and rustled\\namongst his papers. Finally he pushed them away, and leaned over\\nthe desk.\\n\"Now, my dear young lady, let us come to business.\" His large\\nface broadened into a smile. \"You want work? Well, I have work\\nto offer you. What should you say now to L100 down, and all\\nexpenses paid?\" Mr. Whittington leaned back in his chair, and\\nthrust his thumbs into the arm-holes of his waistcoat.\\nTuppence eyed him warily.\\n\"And the nature of the work?\" she demanded.\\n\"Nominal--purely nominal. A pleasant trip, that is all.\"\\n\"Where to?\"\\nMr. Whittington smiled again.\\n\"Paris.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. To herself she said: \"Of\\ncourse, if father heard that he would have a fit! But somehow I\\ndon\\'t see Mr. Whittington in the role of the gay deceiver.\"\\n\"Yes,\" continued Whittington. \"What could be more delightful? To\\nput the clock back a few years--a very few, I am sure--and\\nre-enter one of those charming pensionnats de jeunes filles with\\nwhich Paris abounds----\"\\nTuppence interrupted him.\\n\"A pensionnat?\"\\n\"Exactly. Madame Colombier\\'s in the Avenue de Neuilly.\"\\nTuppence knew the name well. Nothing could have been more\\nselect. She had had several American friends there. She was more\\nthan ever puzzled.\\n\"You want me to go to Madame Colombier\\'s? For how long?\"\\n\"That depends. Possibly three months.\"\\n\"And that is all? There are no other conditions?\"\\n\"None whatever. You would, of course, go in the character of my\\nward, and you would hold no communication with your friends. I\\nshould have to request absolute secrecy for the time being. By\\nthe way, you are English, are you not?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Yet you speak with a slight American accent?\"\\n\"My great pal in hospital was a little American girl. I dare say\\nI picked it up from her. I can soon get out of it again.\"\\n\"On the contrary, it might be simpler for you to pass as an\\nAmerican. Details about your past life in England might be more\\ndifficult to sustain. Yes, I think that would be decidedly\\nbetter. Then----\"\\n\"One moment, Mr. Whittington! You seem to be taking my consent\\nfor granted.\"\\nWhittington looked surprised.\\n\"Surely you are not thinking of refusing? I can assure you that\\nMadame Colombier\\'s is a most high-class and orthodox\\nestablishment. And the terms are most liberal.\"\\n\"Exactly,\" said Tuppence. \"That\\'s just it. The terms are almost\\ntoo liberal, Mr. Whittington. I cannot see any way in which I\\ncan be worth that amount of money to you.\"\\n\"No?\" said Whittington softly. \"Well, I will tell you. I could\\ndoubtless obtain some one else for very much less. What I am\\nwilling to pay for is a young lady with sufficient intelligence\\nand presence of mind to sustain her part well, and also one who\\nwill have sufficient discretion not to ask too many questions.\"\\nTuppence smiled a little. She felt that Whittington had scored.\\n\"There\\'s another thing. So far there has been no mention of Mr.\\nBeresford. Where does he come in?\"\\n\"Mr. Beresford?\"\\n\"My partner,\" said Tuppence with dignity. \"You saw us together\\nyesterday.\"\\n\"Ah, yes. But I\\'m afraid we shan\\'t require his services.\"\\n\"Then it\\'s off!\" Tuppence rose. \"It\\'s both or neither.\\nSorry--but that\\'s how it is. Good morning, Mr. Whittington.\"\\n\"Wait a minute. Let us see if something can\\'t be managed. Sit\\ndown again, Miss----\" He paused interrogatively.\\nTuppence\\'s conscience gave her a passing twinge as she remembered\\nthe archdeacon. She seized hurriedly on the first name that came\\ninto her head.\\n\"Jane Finn,\" she said hastily; and then paused open-mouthed at\\nthe effect of those two simple words.\\nAll the geniality had faded out of Whittington\\'s face. It was\\npurple with rage, and the veins stood out on the forehead. And\\nbehind it all there lurked a sort of incredulous dismay. He\\nleaned forward and hissed savagely:\\n\"So that\\'s your little game, is it?\"\\nTuppence, though utterly taken aback, nevertheless kept her head.\\nShe had not the faintest comprehension of his meaning, but she\\nwas naturally quick-witted, and felt it imperative to \"keep her\\nend up\" as she phrased it.\\nWhittington went on:\\n\"Been playing with me, have you, all the time, like a cat and\\nmouse? Knew all the time what I wanted you for, but kept up the\\ncomedy. Is that it, eh?\" He was cooling down. The red colour\\nwas ebbing out of his face. He eyed her keenly. \"Who\\'s been\\nblabbing? Rita?\"\\nTuppence shook her head. She was doubtful as to how long she\\ncould sustain this illusion, but she realized the importance of\\nnot dragging an unknown Rita into it.\\n\"No,\" she replied with perfect truth. \"Rita knows nothing about\\nme.\"\\nHis eyes still bored into her like gimlets.\\n\"How much do you know?\" he shot out.\\n\"Very little indeed,\" answered Tuppence, and was pleased to note\\nthat Whittington\\'s uneasiness was augmented instead of allayed.\\nTo have boasted that she knew a lot might have raised doubts in\\nhis mind.\\n\"Anyway,\" snarled Whittington, \"you knew enough to come in here\\nand plump out that name.\"\\n\"It might be my own name,\" Tuppence pointed out.\\n\"It\\'s likely, isn\\'t it, then there would be two girls with a name\\nlike that?\"\\n\"Or I might just have hit upon it by chance,\" continued Tuppence,\\nintoxicated with the success of truthfulness.\\nMr. Whittington brought his fist down upon the desk with a bang.\\n\"Quit fooling! How much do you know? And how much do you want?\"\\nThe last five words took Tuppence\\'s fancy mightily, especially\\nafter a meagre breakfast and a supper of buns the night before.\\nHer present part was of the adventuress rather than the\\nadventurous order, but she did not deny its possibilities. She\\nsat up and smiled with the air of one who has the situation\\nthoroughly well in hand.\\n\"My dear Mr. Whittington,\" she said, \"let us by all means lay our\\ncards upon the table. And pray do not be so angry. You heard me\\nsay yesterday that I proposed to live by my wits. It seems to me\\nthat I have now proved I have some wits to live by! I admit I\\nhave knowledge of a certain name, but perhaps my knowledge ends\\nthere.\"\\n\"Yes--and perhaps it doesn\\'t,\" snarled Whittington.\\n\"You insist on misjudging me,\" said Tuppence, and sighed gently.\\n\"As I said once before,\" said Whittington angrily, \"quit fooling,\\nand come to the point. You can\\'t play the innocent with me. You\\nknow a great deal more than you\\'re willing to admit.\"\\nTuppence paused a moment to admire her own ingenuity, and then\\nsaid softly:\\n\"I shouldn\\'t like to contradict you, Mr. Whittington.\"\\n\"So we come to the usual question--how much?\"\\nTuppence was in a dilemma. So far she had fooled Whittington\\nwith complete success, but to mention a palpably impossible sum\\nmight awaken his suspicions. An idea flashed across her brain.\\n\"Suppose we say a little something down, and a fuller discussion\\nof the matter later?\"\\nWhittington gave her an ugly glance.\\n\"Blackmail, eh?\"\\nTuppence smiled sweetly.\\n\"Oh no! Shall we say payment of services in advance?\"\\nWhittington grunted.\\n\"You see,\" explained Tuppence still sweetly, \"I\\'m so very fond of\\nmoney!\"\\n\"You\\'re about the limit, that\\'s what you are,\" growled\\nWhittington, with a sort of unwilling admiration. \"You took me\\nin all right. Thought you were quite a meek little kid with just\\nenough brains for my purpose.\"\\n\"Life,\" moralized Tuppence, \"is full of surprises.\"\\n\"All the same,\" continued Whittington, \"some one\\'s been talking.\\nYou say it isn\\'t Rita. Was it----? Oh, come in.\"\\nThe clerk followed his discreet knock into the room, and laid a\\npaper at his master\\'s elbow.\\n\"Telephone message just come for you, sir.\"\\nWhittington snatched it up and read it. A frown gathered on his\\nbrow.\\n\"That\\'ll do, Brown. You can go.\"\\nThe clerk withdrew, closing the door behind him. Whittington\\nturned to Tuppence.\\n\"Come to-morrow at the same time. I\\'m busy now. Here\\'s fifty to\\ngo on with.\"\\nHe rapidly sorted out some notes, and pushed them across the\\ntable to Tuppence, then stood up, obviously impatient for her to\\ngo.\\nThe girl counted the notes in a businesslike manner, secured them\\nin her handbag, and rose.\\n\"Good morning, Mr. Whittington,\" she said politely. \"At least, au\\nrevoir, I should say.\"\\n\"Exactly. Au revoir!\" Whittington looked almost genial again, a\\nreversion that aroused in Tuppence a faint misgiving. \"Au revoir,\\nmy clever and charming young lady.\"\\nTuppence sped lightly down the stairs. A wild elation possessed\\nher. A neighbouring clock showed the time to be five minutes to\\ntwelve.\\n\"Let\\'s give Tommy a surprise!\" murmured Tuppence, and hailed a\\ntaxi.\\nThe cab drew up outside the tube station. Tommy was just within\\nthe entrance. His eyes opened to their fullest extent as he\\nhurried forward to assist Tuppence to alight. She smiled at him\\naffectionately, and remarked in a slightly affected voice:\\n\"Pay the thing, will you, old bean? I\\'ve got nothing smaller\\nthan a five-pound note!\"\\nCHAPTER III\\nA SET BACK\\nTHE moment was not quite so triumphant as it ought to have been.\\nTo begin with, the resources of Tommy\\'s pockets were somewhat\\nlimited. In the end the fare was managed, the lady recollecting a\\nplebeian twopence, and the driver, still holding the varied\\nassortment of coins in his hand, was prevailed upon to move on,\\nwhich he did after one last hoarse demand as to what the\\ngentleman thought he was giving him?\\n\"I think you\\'ve given him too much, Tommy,\" said Tuppence\\ninnocently. \"I fancy he wants to give some of it back.\"\\nIt was possibly this remark which induced the driver to move\\naway.\\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Beresford, at length able to relieve his\\nfeelings, \"what the--dickens, did you want to take a taxi for?\"\\n\"I was afraid I might be late and keep you waiting,\" said\\nTuppence gently.\\n\"Afraid--you--might--be--late! Oh, Lord, I give it up!\" said Mr.\\nBeresford.\\n\"And really and truly,\" continued Tuppence, opening her eyes very\\nwide, \"I haven\\'t got anything smaller than a five-pound note.\"\\n\"You did that part of it very well, old bean, but all the same\\nthe fellow wasn\\'t taken in--not for a moment!\"\\n\"No,\" said Tuppence thoughtfully, \"he didn\\'t believe it. That\\'s\\nthe curious part about speaking the truth. No one does believe\\nit. I found that out this morning. Now let\\'s go to lunch. How\\nabout the Savoy?\"\\nTommy grinned.\\n\"How about the Ritz?\"\\n\"On second thoughts, I prefer the Piccadilly. It\\'s nearer. We\\nshan\\'t have to take another taxi. Come along.\"\\n\"Is this a new brand of humour? Or is your brain really\\nunhinged?\" inquired Tommy.\\n\"Your last supposition is the correct one. I have come into\\nmoney, and the shock has been too much for me! For that\\nparticular form of mental trouble an eminent physician recommends\\nunlimited Hors d\\'oeuvre, Lobster a l\\'americane, Chicken Newberg,\\nand Peche Melba! Let\\'s go and get them!\"\\n\"Tuppence, old girl, what has really come over you?\"\\n\"Oh, unbelieving one!\" Tuppence wrenched open her bag. \"Look\\nhere, and here, and here!\"\\n\"Great Jehosaphat! My dear girl, don\\'t wave Fishers aloft like\\nthat!\"\\n\"They\\'re not Fishers. They\\'re five times better than Fishers,\\nand this one\\'s ten times better!\"\\nTommy groaned.\\n\"I must have been drinking unawares! Am I dreaming, Tuppence, or\\ndo I really behold a large quantity of five-pound notes being\\nwaved about in a dangerous fashion?\"\\n\"Even so, O King! Now, will you come and have lunch?\"\\n\"I\\'ll come anywhere. But what have you been doing? Holding up a\\nbank?\"\\n\"All in good time. What an awful place Piccadilly Circus is.\\nThere\\'s a huge bus bearing down on us. It would be too terrible\\nif they killed the five-pound notes!\"\\n\"Grill room?\" inquired Tommy, as they reached the opposite\\npavement in safety.\\n\"The other\\'s more expensive,\" demurred Tuppence.\\n\"That\\'s mere wicked wanton extravagance. Come on below.\"\\n\"Are you sure I can get all the things I want there?\"\\n\"That extremely unwholesome menu you were outlining just now? Of\\ncourse you can--or as much as is good for you, anyway.\"\\n\"And now tell me,\" said Tommy, unable to restrain his pent-up\\ncuriosity any longer, as they sat in state surrounded by the many\\nhors d\\'oeuvre of Tuppence\\'s dreams.\\nMiss Cowley told him.\\n\"And the curious part of it is,\" she ended, \"that I really did\\ninvent the name of Jane Finn! I didn\\'t want to give my own\\nbecause of poor father--in case I should get mixed up in anything\\nshady.\"\\n\"Perhaps that\\'s so,\" said Tommy slowly. \"But you didn\\'t invent\\nit.\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"No. I told it to you. Don\\'t you remember, I said yesterday I\\'d\\noverheard two people talking about a female called Jane Finn?\\nThat\\'s what brought the name into your mind so pat.\"\\n\"So you did. I remember now. How extraordinary----\" Tuppence\\ntailed off into silence. Suddenly she aroused herself. \"Tommy!\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"What were they like, the two men you passed?\"\\nTommy frowned in an effort at remembrance.\\n\"One was a big fat sort of chap. Clean shaven, I think--and\\ndark.\"\\n\"That\\'s him,\" cried Tuppence, in an ungrammatical squeal. \"That\\'s\\nWhittington! What was the other man like?\"\\n\"I can\\'t remember. I didn\\'t notice him particularly. It was\\nreally the outlandish name that caught my attention.\"\\n\"And people say that coincidences don\\'t happen!\" Tuppence tackled\\nher Peche Melba happily.\\nBut Tommy had become serious.\\n\"Look here, Tuppence, old girl, what is this going to lead to?\"\\n\"More money,\" replied his companion.\\n\"I know that. You\\'ve only got one idea in your head. What I mean\\nis, what about the next step? How are you going to keep the game\\nup?\"\\n\"Oh!\" Tuppence laid down her spoon. \"You\\'re right, Tommy, it is\\na bit of a poser.\"\\n\"After all, you know, you can\\'t bluff him forever. You\\'re sure to\\nslip up sooner or later. And, anyway, I\\'m not at all sure that\\nit isn\\'t actionable--blackmail, you know.\"\\n\"Nonsense. Blackmail is saying you\\'ll tell unless you are given\\nmoney. Now, there\\'s nothing I could tell, because I don\\'t really\\nknow anything.\"\\n\"Hm,\" said Tommy doubtfully. \"Well, anyway, what ARE we going to\\ndo? Whittington was in a hurry to get rid of you this morning,\\nbut next time he\\'ll want to know something more before he parts\\nwith his money. He\\'ll want to know how much YOU know, and where\\nyou got your information from, and a lot of other things that you\\ncan\\'t cope with. What are you going to do about it?\"\\nTuppence frowned severely.\\n\"We must think. Order some Turkish coffee, Tommy. Stimulating\\nto the brain. Oh, dear, what a lot I have eaten!\"\\n\"You have made rather a hog of yourself! So have I for that\\nmatter, but I flatter myself that my choice of dishes was more\\njudicious than yours. Two coffees.\" (This was to the waiter.)\\n\"One Turkish, one French.\"\\nTuppence sipped her coffee with a deeply reflective air, and\\nsnubbed Tommy when he spoke to her.\\n\"Be quiet. I\\'m thinking.\"\\n\"Shades of Pelmanism!\" said Tommy, and relapsed into silence.\\n\"There!\" said Tuppence at last. \"I\\'ve got a plan. Obviously what\\nwe\\'ve got to do is to find out more about it all.\"\\nTommy applauded.\\n\"Don\\'t jeer. We can only find out through Whittington. We must\\ndiscover where he lives, what he does--sleuth him, in fact! Now I\\ncan\\'t do it, because he knows me, but he only saw you for a\\nminute or two in Lyons\\'. He\\'s not likely to recognize you. After\\nall, one young man is much like another.\"\\n\"I repudiate that remark utterly. I\\'m sure my pleasing features\\nand distinguished appearance would single me out from any crowd.\"\\n\"My plan is this,\" Tuppence went on calmly, \"I\\'ll go alone\\nto-morrow. I\\'ll put him off again like I did to-day. It doesn\\'t\\nmatter if I don\\'t get any more money at once. Fifty pounds ought\\nto last us a few days.\"\\n\"Or even longer!\"\\n\"You\\'ll hang about outside. When I come out I shan\\'t speak to\\nyou in case he\\'s watching. But I\\'ll take up my stand somewhere\\nnear, and when he comes out of the building I\\'ll drop a\\nhandkerchief or something, and off you go!\"\\n\"Off I go where?\"\\n\"Follow him, of course, silly! What do you think of the idea?\"\\n\"Sort of thing one reads about in books. I somehow feel that in\\nreal life one will feel a bit of an ass standing in the street\\nfor hours with nothing to do. People will wonder what I\\'m up\\nto.\"\\n\"Not in the city. Every one\\'s in such a hurry. Probably no one\\nwill even notice you at all.\"\\n\"That\\'s the second time you\\'ve made that sort of remark. Never\\nmind, I forgive you. Anyway, it will be rather a lark. What are\\nyou doing this afternoon?\"\\n\"Well,\" said Tuppence meditatively. \"I HAD thought of hats! Or\\nperhaps silk stockings! Or perhaps----\"\\n\"Hold hard,\" admonished Tommy. \"There\\'s a limit to fifty pounds!\\nBut let\\'s do dinner and a show to-night at all events.\"\\n\"Rather.\"\\nThe day passed pleasantly. The evening even more so. Two of the\\nfive-pound notes were now irretrievably dead.\\nThey met by arrangement the following morning and proceeded\\ncitywards. Tommy remained on the opposite side of the road while\\nTuppence plunged into the building.\\nTommy strolled slowly down to the end of the street, then back\\nagain. Just as he came abreast of the building, Tuppence darted\\nacross the road.\\n\"Tommy!\"\\n\"Yes. What\\'s up?\"\\n\"The place is shut. I can\\'t make anyone hear.\"\\n\"That\\'s odd.\"\\n\"Isn\\'t it? Come up with me, and let\\'s try again.\"\\nTommy followed her. As they passed the third floor landing a\\nyoung clerk came out of an office. He hesitated a moment, then\\naddressed himself to Tuppence.\\n\"Were you wanting the Esthonia Glassware?\"\\n\"Yes, please.\"\\n\"It\\'s closed down. Since yesterday afternoon. Company being\\nwound up, they say. Not that I\\'ve ever heard of it myself. But\\nanyway the office is to let.\"\\n\"Th--thank you,\" faltered Tuppence. \"I suppose you don\\'t know\\nMr. Whittington\\'s address?\"\\n\"Afraid I don\\'t. They left rather suddenly.\"\\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Tommy. \"Come on, Tuppence.\"\\nThey descended to the street again where they gazed at one\\nanother blankly.\\n\"That\\'s torn it,\" said Tommy at length.\\n\"And I never suspected it,\" wailed Tuppence.\\n\"Cheer up, old thing, it can\\'t be helped.\"\\n\"Can\\'t it, though!\" Tuppence\\'s little chin shot out defiantly.\\n\"Do you think this is the end? If so, you\\'re wrong. It\\'s just\\nthe beginning!\"\\n\"The beginning of what?\"\\n\"Of our adventure! Tommy, don\\'t you see, if they are scared\\nenough to run away like this, it shows that there must be a lot\\nin this Jane Finn business! Well, we\\'ll get to the bottom of it.\\nWe\\'ll run them down! We\\'ll be sleuths in earnest!\"\\n\"Yes, but there\\'s no one left to sleuth.\"\\n\"No, that\\'s why we\\'ll have to start all over again. Lend me that\\nbit of pencil. Thanks. Wait a minute--don\\'t interrupt. There!\"\\nTuppence handed back the pencil, and surveyed the piece of paper\\non which she had written with a satisfied eye:\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\n\"Advertisement.\"\\n\"You\\'re not going to put that thing in after all?\"\\n\"No, it\\'s a different one.\" She handed him the slip of paper.\\nTommy read the words on it aloud:\\n\"WANTED, any information respecting Jane Finn. Apply Y.A.\"\\nCHAPTER IV\\nWHO IS JANE FINN?\\nTHE next day passed slowly. It was necessary to curtail\\nexpenditure. Carefully husbanded, forty pounds will last a long\\ntime. Luckily the weather was fine, and \"walking is cheap,\"\\ndictated Tuppence. An outlying picture house provided them with\\nrecreation for the evening.\\nThe day of disillusionment had been a Wednesday. On Thursday the\\nadvertisement had duly appeared. On Friday letters might be\\nexpected to arrive at Tommy\\'s rooms.\\nHe had been bound by an honourable promise not to open any such\\nletters if they did arrive, but to repair to the National\\nGallery, where his colleague would meet him at ten o\\'clock.\\nTuppence was first at the rendezvous. She ensconced herself on a\\nred velvet seat, and gazed at the Turners with unseeing eyes\\nuntil she saw the familiar figure enter the room.\\n\"Well?\"\\n\"Well,\" returned Mr. Beresford provokingly. \"Which is your\\nfavourite picture?\"\\n\"Don\\'t be a wretch. Aren\\'t there ANY answers?\"\\nTommy shook his head with a deep and somewhat overacted\\nmelancholy.\\n\"I didn\\'t want to disappoint you, old thing, by telling you right\\noff. It\\'s too bad. Good money wasted.\" He sighed. \"Still,\\nthere it is. The advertisement has appeared, and--there are only\\ntwo answers!\"\\n\"Tommy, you devil!\" almost screamed Tuppence. \"Give them to me.\\nHow could you be so mean!\"\\n\"Your language, Tuppence, your language! They\\'re very particular\\nat the National Gallery. Government show, you know. And do\\nremember, as I have pointed out to you before, that as a\\nclergyman\\'s daughter----\"\\n\"I ought to be on the stage!\" finished Tuppence with a snap.\\n\"That is not what I intended to say. But if you are sure that\\nyou have enjoyed to the full the reaction of joy after despair\\nwith which I have kindly provided you free of charge, let us get\\ndown to our mail, as the saying goes.\"\\nTuppence snatched the two precious envelopes from him\\nunceremoniously, and scrutinized them carefully.\\n\"Thick paper, this one. It looks rich. We\\'ll keep it to the\\nlast and open the other first.\"\\n\"Right you are. One, two, three, go!\"\\nTuppence\\'s little thumb ripped open the envelope, and she\\nextracted the contents.\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\n\"Referring to your advertisement in this morning\\'s paper, I may\\nbe able to be of some use to you. Perhaps you could call and see\\nme at the above address at eleven o\\'clock to-morrow morning.\\n\"Yours truly,\\n\"A. CARTER.\\n\"27 Carshalton Gardens,\" said Tuppence, referring to the address.\\n\"That\\'s Gloucester Road way. Plenty of time to get there if we\\ntube.\"\\n\"The following,\" said Tommy, \"is the plan of campaign. It is my\\nturn to assume the offensive. Ushered into the presence of Mr.\\nCarter, he and I wish each other good morning as is customary. He\\nthen says: \\'Please take a seat, Mr.--er?\\' To which I reply\\npromptly and significantly: \\'Edward Whittington!\\' whereupon Mr.\\nCarter turns purple in the face and gasps out: \\'How much?\\'\\nPocketing the usual fee of fifty pounds, I rejoin you in the road\\noutside, and we proceed to the next address and repeat the\\nperformance.\"\\n\"Don\\'t be absurd, Tommy. Now for the other letter. Oh, this is\\nfrom the Ritz!\"\\n\"A hundred pounds instead of fifty!\"\\n\"I\\'ll read it:\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\n\"Re your advertisement, I should be glad if you would call round\\nsomewhere about lunch-time.\\n\"Yours truly,\\n\"JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER.\"\\n\"Ha!\" said Tommy. \"Do I smell a Boche? Or only an American\\nmillionaire of unfortunate ancestry? At all events we\\'ll call at\\nlunch-time. It\\'s a good time--frequently leads to free food for\\ntwo.\"\\nTuppence nodded assent.\\n\"Now for Carter. We\\'ll have to hurry.\"\\nCarshalton Terrace proved to be an unimpeachable row of what\\nTuppence called \"ladylike looking houses.\" They rang the bell at\\nNo. 27, and a neat maid answered the door. She looked so\\nrespectable that Tuppence\\'s heart sank. Upon Tommy\\'s request for\\nMr. Carter, she showed them into a small study on the ground\\nfloor where she left them. Hardly a minute elapsed, however,\\nbefore the door opened, and a tall man with a lean hawklike face\\nand a tired manner entered the room.\\n\"Mr. Y. A.?\" he said, and smiled. His smile was distinctly\\nattractive. \"Do sit down, both of you.\"\\nThey obeyed. He himself took a chair opposite to Tuppence and\\nsmiled at her encouragingly. There was something in the quality\\nof his smile that made the girl\\'s usual readiness desert her.\\nAs he did not seem inclined to open the conversation, Tuppence\\nwas forced to begin.\\n\"We wanted to know--that is, would you be so kind as to tell us\\nanything you know about Jane Finn?\"\\n\"Jane Finn? Ah!\" Mr. Carter appeared to reflect. \"Well, the\\nquestion is, what do you know about her?\"\\nTuppence drew herself up.\\n\"I don\\'t see that that\\'s got anything to do with it.\"\\n\"No? But it has, you know, really it has.\" He smiled again in\\nhis tired way, and continued reflectively. \"So that brings us\\ndown to it again. What do you know about Jane Finn?\\n\"Come now,\" he continued, as Tuppence remained silent. \"You must\\nknow SOMETHING to have advertised as you did?\" He leaned forward\\na little, his weary voice held a hint of persuasiveness. \"Suppose\\nyou tell me . . .\"\\nThere was something very magnetic about Mr. Carter\\'s personality.\\nTuppence seemed to shake herself free of it with an effort, as\\nshe said:\\n\"We couldn\\'t do that, could we, Tommy?\"\\nBut to her surprise, her companion did not back her up. His eyes\\nwere fixed on Mr. Carter, and his tone when he spoke held an\\nunusual note of deference.\\n\"I dare say the little we know won\\'t be any good to you, sir. But\\nsuch as it is, you\\'re welcome to it.\"\\n\"Tommy!\" cried out Tuppence in surprise.\\nMr. Carter slewed round in his chair. His eyes asked a question.\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"Yes, sir, I recognized you at once. Saw you in France when I\\nwas with the Intelligence. As soon as you came into the room, I\\nknew----\"\\nMr. Carter held up his hand.\\n\"No names, please. I\\'m known as Mr. Carter here. It\\'s my\\ncousin\\'s house, by the way. She\\'s willing to lend it to me\\nsometimes when it\\'s a case of working on strictly unofficial\\nlines. Well, now\"--he looked from one to the other--\"who\\'s going\\nto tell me the story?\"\\n\"Fire ahead, Tuppence,\" directed Tommy. \"It\\'s your yarn.\"\\n\"Yes, little lady, out with it.\"\\nAnd obediently Tuppence did out with it, telling the whole story\\nfrom the forming of the Young Adventurers, Ltd., downwards.\\nMr. Carter listened in silence with a resumption of his tired\\nmanner. Now and then he passed his hand across his lips as though\\nto hide a smile. When she had finished he nodded gravely.\\n\"Not much. But suggestive. Quite suggestive. If you\\'ll excuse\\nmy saying so, you\\'re a curious young couple. I don\\'t know--you\\nmight succeed where others have failed . . . I believe in luck,\\nyou know--always have....\"\\nHe paused a moment, and then went on.\\n\"Well, how about it? You\\'re out for adventure. How would you\\nlike to work for me? All quite unofficial, you know. Expenses\\npaid, and a moderate screw?\"\\nTuppence gazed at him, her lips parted, her eyes growing wider\\nand wider.\\n\"What should we have to do?\" she breathed.\\nMr. Carter smiled.\\n\"Just go on with what you\\'re doing now. FIND JANE FINN.\"\\n\"Yes, but--who IS Jane Finn?\"\\nMr. Carter nodded gravely.\\n\"Yes, you\\'re entitled to know that, I think.\"\\nHe leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs, brought the tips\\nof his fingers together, and began in a low monotone:\\n\"Secret diplomacy (which, by the way, is nearly always bad\\npolicy!) does not concern you. It will be sufficient to say that\\nin the early days of 1915 a certain document came into being. It\\nwas the draft of a secret agreement--treaty--call it what you\\nlike. It was drawn up ready for signature by the various\\nrepresentatives, and drawn up in America--at that time a neutral\\ncountry. It was dispatched to England by a special messenger\\nselected for that purpose, a young fellow called Danvers. It was\\nhoped that the whole affair had been kept so secret that nothing\\nwould have leaked out. That kind of hope is usually\\ndisappointed. Somebody always talks!\\n\"Danvers sailed for England on the Lusitania. He carried the\\nprecious papers in an oilskin packet which he wore next his skin.\\nIt was on that particular voyage that the Lusitania was torpedoed\\nand sunk. Danvers was among the list of those missing.\\nEventually his body was washed ashore, and identified beyond any\\npossible doubt. But the oilskin packet was missing!\\n\"The question was, had it been taken from him, or had he himself\\npassed it on into another\\'s keeping? There were a few incidents\\nthat strengthened the possibility of the latter theory. After the\\ntorpedo struck the ship, in the few moments during the launching\\nof the boats, Danvers was seen speaking to a young American girl.\\nNo one actually saw him pass anything to her, but he might have\\ndone so. It seems to me quite likely that he entrusted the papers\\nto this girl, believing that she, as a woman, had a greater\\nchance of bringing them safely to shore.\\n\"But if so, where was the girl, and what had she done with the\\npapers? By later advice from America it seemed likely that\\nDanvers had been closely shadowed on the way over. Was this girl\\nin league with his enemies? Or had she, in her turn, been\\nshadowed and either tricked or forced into handing over the\\nprecious packet?\\n\"We set to work to trace her out. It proved unexpectedly\\ndifficult. Her name was Jane Finn, and it duly appeared among the\\nlist of the survivors, but the girl herself seemed to have\\nvanished completely. Inquiries into her antecedents did little to\\nhelp us. She was an orphan, and had been what we should call\\nover here a pupil teacher in a small school out West. Her\\npassport had been made out for Paris, where she was going to join\\nthe staff of a hospital. She had offered her services\\nvoluntarily, and after some correspondence they had been\\naccepted. Having seen her name in the list of the saved from the\\nLusitania, the staff of the hospital were naturally very\\nsurprised at her not arriving to take up her billet, and at not\\nhearing from her in any way.\\n\"Well, every effort was made to trace the young lady--but all in\\nvain. We tracked her across Ireland, but nothing could be heard\\nof her after she set foot in England. No use was made of the\\ndraft treaty--as might very easily have been done--and we\\ntherefore came to the conclusion that Danvers had, after all,\\ndestroyed it. The war entered on another phase, the diplomatic\\naspect changed accordingly, and the treaty was never redrafted.\\nRumours as to its existence were emphatically denied. The\\ndisappearance of Jane Finn was forgotten and the whole affair was\\nlost in oblivion.\"\\nMr. Carter paused, and Tuppence broke in impatiently:\\n\"But why has it all cropped up again? The war\\'s over.\"\\nA hint of alertness came into Mr. Carter\\'s manner.\\n\"Because it seems that the papers were not destroyed after all,\\nand that they might be resurrected to-day with a new and deadly\\nsignificance.\"\\nTuppence stared. Mr. Carter nodded.\\n\"Yes, five years ago, that draft treaty was a weapon in our\\nhands; to-day it is a weapon against us. It was a gigantic\\nblunder. If its terms were made public, it would mean\\ndisaster.... It might possibly bring about another war--not with\\nGermany this time! That is an extreme possibility, and I do not\\nbelieve in its likelihood myself, but that document undoubtedly\\nimplicates a number of our statesmen whom we cannot afford to\\nhave discredited in any way at the present moment. As a party\\ncry for Labour it would be irresistible, and a Labour Government\\nat this juncture would, in my opinion, be a grave disability for\\nBritish trade, but that is a mere nothing to the REAL danger.\"\\nHe paused, and then said quietly:\\n\"You may perhaps have heard or read that there is Bolshevist\\ninfluence at work behind the present Labour unrest?\"\\nTuppence nodded.\\n\"That is the truth. Bolshevist gold is pouring into this country\\nfor the specific purpose of procuring a Revolution. And there is\\na certain man, a man whose real name is unknown to us, who is\\nworking in the dark for his own ends. The Bolshevists are behind\\nthe Labour unrest--but this man is BEHIND THE BOLSHEVISTS. Who\\nis he? We do not know. He is always spoken of by the unassuming\\ntitle of \\'Mr. Brown.\\' But one thing is certain, he is the master\\ncriminal of this age. He controls a marvellous organization.\\nMost of the Peace propaganda during the war was originated and\\nfinanced by him. His spies are everywhere.\"\\n\"A naturalized German?\" asked Tommy.\\n\"On the contrary, I have every reason to believe he is an\\nEnglishman. He was pro-German, as he would have been pro-Boer.\\nWhat he seeks to attain we do not know--probably supreme power\\nfor himself, of a kind unique in history. We have no clue as to\\nhis real personality. It is reported that even his own followers\\nare ignorant of it. Where we have come across his tracks, he has\\nalways played a secondary part. Somebody else assumes the chief\\nrole. But afterwards we always find that there has been some\\nnonentity, a servant or a clerk, who has remained in the\\nbackground unnoticed, and that the elusive Mr. Brown has escaped\\nus once more.\"\\n\"Oh!\" Tuppence jumped. \"I wonder----\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"I remember in Mr. Whittington\\'s office. The clerk--he called\\nhim Brown. You don\\'t think----\"\\nCarter nodded thoughtfully.\\n\"Very likely. A curious point is that the name is usually\\nmentioned. An idiosyncrasy of genius. Can you describe him at\\nall?\"\\n\"I really didn\\'t notice. He was quite ordinary--just like anyone\\nelse.\"\\nMr. Carter sighed in his tired manner.\\n\"That is the invariable description of Mr. Brown! Brought a\\ntelephone message to the man Whittington, did he? Notice a\\ntelephone in the outer office?\"\\nTuppence thought.\\n\"No, I don\\'t think I did.\"\\n\"Exactly. That \\'message\\' was Mr. Brown\\'s way of giving an order\\nto his subordinate. He overheard the whole conversation of\\ncourse. Was it after that that Whittington handed you over the\\nmoney, and told you to come the following day?\"\\nTuppence nodded.\\n\"Yes, undoubtedly the hand of Mr. Brown!\" Mr. Carter paused.\\n\"Well, there it is, you see what you are pitting yourselves\\nagainst? Possibly the finest criminal brain of the age. I don\\'t\\nquite like it, you know. You\\'re such young things, both of you.\\nI shouldn\\'t like anything to happen to you.\"\\n\"It won\\'t,\" Tuppence assured him positively.\\n\"I\\'ll look after her, sir,\" said Tommy.\\n\"And I\\'ll look after YOU,\" retorted Tuppence, resenting the manly\\nassertion.\\n\"Well, then, look after each other,\" said Mr. Carter, smiling.\\n\"Now let\\'s get back to business. There\\'s something mysterious\\nabout this draft treaty that we haven\\'t fathomed yet. We\\'ve been\\nthreatened with it--in plain and unmistakable terms. The\\nRevolutionary element as good as declare that it\\'s in their\\nhands, and that they intend to produce it at a given moment. On\\nthe other hand, they are clearly at fault about many of its\\nprovisions. The Government consider it as mere bluff on their\\npart, and, rightly or wrongly, have stuck to the policy of\\nabsolute denial. I\\'m not so sure. There have been hints,\\nindiscreet allusions, that seem to indicate that the menace is a\\nreal one. The position is much as though they had got hold of an\\nincriminating document, but couldn\\'t read it because it was in\\ncipher--but we know that the draft treaty wasn\\'t in\\ncipher--couldn\\'t be in the nature of things--so that won\\'t wash.\\nBut there\\'s SOMETHING. Of course, Jane Finn may be dead for all\\nwe know--but I don\\'t think so. The curious thing is that THEY\\'RE\\nTRYING TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE GIRL FROM US\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"Yes. One or two little things have cropped up. And your story,\\nlittle lady, confirms my idea. They know we\\'re looking for Jane\\nFinn. Well, they\\'ll produce a Jane Finn of their own--say at a\\npensionnat in Paris.\" Tuppence gasped, and Mr. Carter smiled.\\n\"No one knows in the least what she looks like, so that\\'s all\\nright. She\\'s primed with a trumped-up tale, and her real business\\nis to get as much information as possible out of us. See the\\nidea?\"\\n\"Then you think\"--Tuppence paused to grasp the supposition\\nfully--\"that it WAS as Jane Finn that they wanted me to go to\\nParis?\"\\nMr. Carter smiled more wearily than ever.\\n\"I believe in coincidences, you know,\" he said.\\nCHAPTER V\\nMR. JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER\\n\"WELL,\" said Tuppence, recovering herself, \"it really seems as\\nthough it were meant to be.\"\\nCarter nodded.\\n\"I know what you mean. I\\'m superstitious myself. Luck, and all\\nthat sort of thing. Fate seems to have chosen you out to be\\nmixed up in this.\"\\nTommy indulged in a chuckle.\\n\"My word! I don\\'t wonder Whittington got the wind up when\\nTuppence plumped out that name! I should have myself. But look\\nhere, sir, we\\'re taking up an awful lot of your time. Have you\\nany tips to give us before we clear out?\"\\n\"I think not. My experts, working in stereotyped ways, have\\nfailed. You will bring imagination and an open mind to the task.\\nDon\\'t be discouraged if that too does not succeed. For one thing\\nthere is a likelihood of the pace being forced.\"\\nTuppence frowned uncomprehendingly.\\n\"When you had that interview with Whittington, they had time\\nbefore them. I have information that the big coup was planned for\\nearly in the new year. But the Government is contemplating\\nlegislative action which will deal effectually with the strike\\nmenace. They\\'ll get wind of it soon, if they haven\\'t already,\\nand it\\'s possible that that may bring things to a head. I hope it\\nwill myself. The less time they have to mature their plans the\\nbetter. I\\'m just warning you that you haven\\'t much time before\\nyou, and that you needn\\'t be cast down if you fail. It\\'s not an\\neasy proposition anyway. That\\'s all.\"\\nTuppence rose.\\n\"I think we ought to be businesslike. What exactly can we count\\nupon you for, Mr. Carter?\" Mr. Carter\\'s lips twitched slightly,\\nbut he replied succinctly: \"Funds within reason, detailed\\ninformation on any point, and NO OFFICIAL RECOGNITION. I mean\\nthat if you get yourselves into trouble with the police, I can\\'t\\nofficially help you out of it. You\\'re on your own.\"\\nTuppence nodded sagely.\\n\"I quite understand that. I\\'ll write out a list of the things I\\nwant to know when I\\'ve had time to think. Now--about money----\"\\n\"Yes, Miss Tuppence. Do you want to say how much?\"\\n\"Not exactly. We\\'ve got plenty to go with for the present, but\\nwhen we want more----\"\\n\"It will be waiting for you.\"\\n\"Yes, but--I\\'m sure I don\\'t want to be rude about the Government\\nif you\\'ve got anything to do with it, but you know one really has\\nthe devil of a time getting anything out of it! And if we have to\\nfill up a blue form and send it in, and then, after three months,\\nthey send us a green one, and so on--well, that won\\'t be much\\nuse, will it?\"\\nMr. Carter laughed outright.\\n\"Don\\'t worry, Miss Tuppence. You will send a personal demand to\\nme here, and the money, in notes, shall be sent by return of\\npost. As to salary, shall we say at the rate of three hundred a\\nyear? And an equal sum for Mr. Beresford, of course.\"\\nTuppence beamed upon him.\\n\"How lovely. You are kind. I do love money! I\\'ll keep\\nbeautiful accounts of our expenses all debit and credit, and the\\nbalance on the right side, and red line drawn sideways with the\\ntotals the same at the bottom. I really know how to do it when I\\nthink.\"\\n\"I\\'m sure you do. Well, good-bye, and good luck to you both.\"\\nHe shook hands with them, and in another minute they were\\ndescending the steps of 27 Carshalton Terrace with their heads in\\na whirl.\\n\"Tommy! Tell me at once, who is \\'Mr. Carter\\'?\"\\nTommy murmured a name in her ear.\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence, impressed.\\n\"And I can tell you, old bean, he\\'s IT!\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence again. Then she added reflectively,\\n\"I like him, don\\'t you? He looks so awfully tired and bored, and\\nyet you feel that underneath he\\'s just like steel, all keen and\\nflashing. Oh!\" She gave a skip. \"Pinch me, Tommy, do pinch me.\\nI can\\'t believe it\\'s real!\"\\nMr. Beresford obliged.\\n\"Ow! That\\'s enough! Yes, we\\'re not dreaming. We\\'ve got a job!\"\\n\"And what a job! The joint venture has really begun.\"\\n\"It\\'s more respectable than I thought it would be,\" said Tuppence\\nthoughtfully.\\n\"Luckily I haven\\'t got your craving for crime! What time is it?\\nLet\\'s have lunch--oh!\"\\nThe same thought sprang to the minds of each. Tommy voiced it\\nfirst.\\n\"Julius P. Hersheimmer!\"\\n\"We never told Mr. Carter about hearing from him.\"\\n\"Well, there wasn\\'t much to tell--not till we\\'ve seen him. Come\\non, we\\'d better take a taxi.\"\\n\"Now who\\'s being extravagant?\"\\n\"All expenses paid, remember. Hop in.\"\\n\"At any rate, we shall make a better effect arriving this way,\"\\nsaid Tuppence, leaning back luxuriously. \"I\\'m sure blackmailers\\nnever arrive in buses!\"\\n\"We\\'ve ceased being blackmailers,\" Tommy pointed out.\\n\"I\\'m not sure I have,\" said Tuppence darkly.\\nOn inquiring for Mr. Hersheimmer, they were at once taken up to\\nhis suite. An impatient voice cried \"Come in\" in answer to the\\npage-boy\\'s knock, and the lad stood aside to let them pass in.\\nMr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was a great deal younger than either\\nTommy or Tuppence had pictured him. The girl put him down as\\nthirty-five. He was of middle height, and squarely built to match\\nhis jaw. His face was pugnacious but pleasant. No one could have\\nmistaken him for anything but an American, though he spoke with\\nvery little accent.\\n\"Get my note? Sit down and tell me right away all you know about\\nmy cousin.\"\\n\"Your cousin?\"\\n\"Sure thing. Jane Finn.\"\\n\"Is she your cousin?\"\\n\"My father and her mother were brother and sister,\" explained Mr.\\nHersheimmer meticulously.\\n\"Oh!\" cried Tuppence. \"Then you know where she is?\"\\n\"No!\" Mr. Hersheimmer brought down his fist with a bang on the\\ntable. \"I\\'m darned if I do! Don\\'t you?\"\\n\"We advertised to receive information, not to give it,\" said\\nTuppence severely.\\n\"I guess I know that. I can read. But I thought maybe it was\\nher back history you were after, and that you\\'d know where she\\nwas now?\"\\n\"Well, we wouldn\\'t mind hearing her back history,\" said Tuppence\\nguardedly.\\nBut Mr. Hersheimmer seemed to grow suddenly suspicious.\\n\"See here,\" he declared. \"This isn\\'t Sicily! No demanding\\nransom or threatening to crop her ears if I refuse. These are the\\nBritish Isles, so quit the funny business, or I\\'ll just sing out\\nfor that beautiful big British policeman I see out there in\\nPiccadilly.\"\\nTommy hastened to explain.\\n\"We haven\\'t kidnapped your cousin. On the contrary, we\\'re trying\\nto find her. We\\'re employed to do so.\"\\nMr. Hersheimmer leant back in his chair.\\n\"Put me wise,\" he said succinctly.\\nTommy fell in with this demand in so far as he gave him a guarded\\nversion of the disappearance of Jane Finn, and of the possibility\\nof her having been mixed up unawares in \"some political show.\" He\\nalluded to Tuppence and himself as \"private inquiry agents\"\\ncommissioned to find her, and added that they would therefore be\\nglad of any details Mr. Hersheimmer could give them.\\nThat gentleman nodded approval.\\n\"I guess that\\'s all right. I was just a mite hasty. But London\\ngets my goat! I only know little old New York. Just trot out\\nyour questions and I\\'ll answer.\"\\nFor the moment this paralysed the Young Adventurers, but\\nTuppence, recovering herself, plunged boldly into the breach with\\na reminiscence culled from detective fiction.\\n\"When did you last see the dece--your cousin, I mean?\"\\n\"Never seen her,\" responded Mr. Hersheimmer.\\n\"What?\" demanded Tommy, astonished.\\nHersheimmer turned to him.\\n\"No, sir. As I said before, my father and her mother were\\nbrother and sister, just as you might be\"--Tommy did not correct\\nthis view of their relationship--\"but they didn\\'t always get on\\ntogether. And when my aunt made up her mind to marry Amos Finn,\\nwho was a poor school teacher out West, my father was just mad!\\nSaid if he made his pile, as he seemed in a fair way to do, she\\'d\\nnever see a cent of it. Well, the upshot was that Aunt Jane went\\nout West and we never heard from her again.\\n\"The old man DID pile it up. He went into oil, and he went into\\nsteel, and he played a bit with railroads, and I can tell you he\\nmade Wall Street sit up!\" He paused. \"Then he died--last\\nfall--and I got the dollars. Well, would you believe it, my\\nconscience got busy! Kept knocking me up and saying: What\\nabour{sic} your Aunt Jane, way out West? It worried me some. You\\nsee, I figured it out that Amos Finn would never make good. He\\nwasn\\'t the sort. End of it was, I hired a man to hunt her down.\\nResult, she was dead, and Amos Finn was dead, but they\\'d left a\\ndaughter--Jane--who\\'d been torpedoed in the Lusitania on her way\\nto Paris. She was saved all right, but they didn\\'t seem able to\\nhear of her over this side. I guessed they weren\\'t hustling any,\\nso I thought I\\'d come along over, and speed things up. I phoned\\nScotland Yard and the Admiralty first thing. The Admiralty\\nrather choked me off, but Scotland Yard were very civil--said\\nthey would make inquiries, even sent a man round this morning to\\nget her photograph. I\\'m off to Paris to-morrow, just to see what\\nthe Prefecture is doing. I guess if I go to and fro hustling\\nthem, they ought to get busy!\"\\nThe energy of Mr. Hersheimmer was tremendous. They bowed before\\nit.\\n\"But say now,\" he ended, \"you\\'re not after her for anything?\\nContempt of court, or something British? A proud-spirited young\\nAmerican girl might find your rules and regulations in war time\\nrather irksome, and get up against it. If that\\'s the case, and\\nthere\\'s such a thing as graft in this country, I\\'ll buy her off.\"\\nTuppence reassured him.\\n\"That\\'s good. Then we can work together. What about some lunch?\\nShall we have it up here, or go down to the restaurant?\"\\nTuppence expressed a preference for the latter, and Julius bowed\\nto her decision.\\nOysters had just given place to Sole Colbert when a card was\\nbrought to Hersheimmer.\\n\"Inspector Japp, C.I.D. Scotland Yard again. Another man this\\ntime. What does he expect I can tell him that I didn\\'t tell the\\nfirst chap? I hope they haven\\'t lost that photograph. That\\nWestern photographer\\'s place was burned down and all his\\nnegatives destroyed--this is the only copy in existence. I got it\\nfrom the principal of the college there.\"\\nAn unformulated dread swept over Tuppence.\\n\"You--you don\\'t know the name of the man who came this morning?\"\\n\"Yes, I do. No, I don\\'t. Half a second. It was on his card.\\nOh, I know! Inspector Brown. Quiet, unassuming sort of chap.\"\\nCHAPTER VI\\nA PLAN OF CAMPAIGN\\nA veil might with profit be drawn over the events of the next\\nhalf-hour. Suffice it to say that no such person as \"Inspector\\nBrown\" was known to Scotland Yard. The photograph of Jane Finn,\\nwhich would have been of the utmost value to the police in\\ntracing her, was lost beyond recovery. Once again \"Mr. Brown\" had\\ntriumphed.\\nThe immediate result of this set back was to effect a\\nrapprochement between Julius Hersheimmer and the Young\\nAdventurers. All barriers went down with a crash, and Tommy and\\nTuppence felt they had known the young American all their lives.\\nThey abandoned the discreet reticence of \"private inquiry\\nagents,\" and revealed to him the whole history of the joint\\nventure, whereat the young man declared himself \"tickled to\\ndeath.\"\\nHe turned to Tuppence at the close of the narration.\\n\"I\\'ve always had a kind of idea that English girls were just a\\nmite moss-grown. Old-fashioned and sweet, you know, but scared to\\nmove round without a footman or a maiden aunt. I guess I\\'m a bit\\nbehind the times!\"\\nThe upshot of these confidential relations was that Tommy and\\nTuppence took up their abode forthwith at the Ritz, in order, as\\nTuppence put it, to keep in touch with Jane Finn\\'s only living\\nrelation. \"And put like that,\" she added confidentially to Tommy,\\n\"nobody could boggle at the expense!\"\\nNobody did, which was the great thing.\\n\"And now,\" said the young lady on the morning after their\\ninstallation, \"to work!\"\\nMr. Beresford put down the Daily Mail, which he was reading, and\\napplauded with somewhat unnecessary vigour. He was politely\\nrequested by his colleague not to be an ass.\\n\"Dash it all, Tommy, we\\'ve got to DO something for our money.\"\\nTommy sighed.\\n\"Yes, I fear even the dear old Government will not support us at\\nthe Ritz in idleness for ever.\"\\n\"Therefore, as I said before, we must DO something.\"\\n\"Well,\" said Tommy, picking up the Daily Mail again, \"DO it. I\\nshan\\'t stop you.\"\\n\"You see,\" continued Tuppence. \"I\\'ve been thinking----\"\\nShe was interrupted by a fresh bout of applause.\\n\"It\\'s all very well for you to sit there being funny, Tommy. It\\nwould do you no harm to do a little brain work too.\"\\n\"My union, Tuppence, my union! It does not permit me to work\\nbefore 11 a.m.\"\\n\"Tommy, do you want something thrown at you? It is absolutely\\nessential that we should without delay map out a plan of\\ncampaign.\"\\n\"Hear, hear!\"\\n\"Well, let\\'s do it.\"\\nTommy laid his paper finally aside. \"There\\'s something of the\\nsimplicity of the truly great mind about you, Tuppence. Fire\\nahead. I\\'m listening.\"\\n\"To begin with,\" said Tuppence, \"what have we to go upon?\"\\n\"Absolutely nothing,\" said Tommy cheerily.\\n\"Wrong!\" Tuppence wagged an energetic finger. \"We have two\\ndistinct clues.\"\\n\"What are they?\"\\n\"First clue, we know one of the gang.\"\\n\"Whittington?\"\\n\"Yes. I\\'d recognize him anywhere.\"\\n\"Hum,\" said Tommy doubtfully, \"I don\\'t call that much of a clue.\\nYou don\\'t know where to look for him, and it\\'s about a thousand\\nto one against your running against him by accident.\"\\n\"I\\'m not so sure about that,\" replied Tuppence thoughtfully.\\n\"I\\'ve often noticed that once coincidences start happening they\\ngo on happening in the most extraordinary way. I dare say it\\'s\\nsome natural law that we haven\\'t found out. Still, as you say, we\\ncan\\'t rely on that. But there ARE places in London where simply\\nevery one is bound to turn up sooner or later. Piccadilly Circus,\\nfor instance. One of my ideas was to take up my stand there\\nevery day with a tray of flags.\"\\n\"What about meals?\" inquired the practical Tommy.\\n\"How like a man! What does mere food matter?\"\\n\"That\\'s all very well. You\\'ve just had a thundering good\\nbreakfast. No one\\'s got a better appetite than you have,\\nTuppence, and by tea-time you\\'d be eating the flags, pins and\\nall. But, honestly, I don\\'t think much of the idea. Whittington\\nmayn\\'t be in London at all.\"\\n\"That\\'s true. Anyway, I think clue No. 2 is more promising.\"\\n\"Let\\'s hear it.\"\\n\"It\\'s nothing much. Only a Christian name--Rita. Whittington\\nmentioned it that day.\"\\n\"Are you proposing a third advertisement: Wanted, female crook,\\nanswering to the name of Rita?\"\\n\"I am not. I propose to reason in a logical manner. That man,\\nDanvers, was shadowed on the way over, wasn\\'t he? And it\\'s more\\nlikely to have been a woman than a man----\"\\n\"I don\\'t see that at all.\"\\n\"I am absolutely certain that it would be a woman, and a\\ngood-looking one,\" replied Tuppence calmly.\\n\"On these technical points I bow to your decision,\" murmured Mr.\\nBeresford.\\n\"Now, obviously this woman, whoever she was, was saved.\"\\n\"How do you make that out?\"\\n\"If she wasn\\'t, how would they have known Jane Finn had got the\\npapers?\"\\n\"Correct. Proceed, O Sherlock!\"\\n\"Now there\\'s just a chance, I admit it\\'s only a chance, that this\\nwoman may have been \\'Rita.\\' \"\\n\"And if so?\"\\n\"If so, we\\'ve got to hunt through the survivors of the Lusitania\\ntill we find her.\"\\n\"Then the first thing is to get a list of the survivors.\"\\n\"I\\'ve got it. I wrote a long list of things I wanted to know,\\nand sent it to Mr. Carter. I got his reply this morning, and\\namong other things it encloses the official statement of those\\nsaved from the Lusitania. How\\'s that for clever little\\nTuppence?\"\\n\"Full marks for industry, zero for modesty. But the great point\\nis, is there a \\'Rita\\' on the list?\"\\n\"That\\'s just what I don\\'t know,\" confessed Tuppence.\\n\"Don\\'t know?\"\\n\"Yes. Look here.\" Together they bent over the list. \"You see,\\nvery few Christian names are given. They\\'re nearly all Mrs. or\\nMiss.\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"That complicates matters,\" he murmured thoughtfully.\\nTuppence gave her characteristic \"terrier\" shake.\\n\"Well, we\\'ve just got to get down to it, that\\'s all. We\\'ll start\\nwith the London area. Just note down the addresses of any of the\\nfemales who live in London or roundabout, while I put on my hat.\"\\nFive minutes later the young couple emerged into Piccadilly, and\\na few seconds later a taxi was bearing them to The Laurels,\\nGlendower Road, N.7, the residence of Mrs. Edgar Keith, whose\\nname figured first in a list of seven reposing in Tommy\\'s\\npocket-book.\\nThe Laurels was a dilapidated house, standing back from the road\\nwith a few grimy bushes to support the fiction of a front garden.\\nTommy paid off the taxi, and accompanied Tuppence to the front\\ndoor bell. As she was about to ring it, he arrested her hand.\\n\"What are you going to say?\"\\n\"What am I going to say? Why, I shall say--Oh dear, I don\\'t\\nknow. It\\'s very awkward.\"\\n\"I thought as much,\" said Tommy with satisfaction. \"How like a\\nwoman! No foresight! Now just stand aside, and see how easily\\nthe mere male deals with the situation.\" He pressed the bell.\\nTuppence withdrew to a suitable spot.\\nA slatternly looking servant, with an extremely dirty face and a\\npair of eyes that did not match, answered the door.\\nTommy had produced a notebook and pencil.\\n\"Good morning,\" he said briskly and cheerfully. \"From the\\nHampstead Borough Council. The new Voting Register. Mrs. Edgar\\nKeith lives here, does she not?\"\\n\"Yaas,\" said the servant.\\n\"Christian name?\" asked Tommy, his pencil poised.\\n\"Missus\\'s? Eleanor Jane.\"\\n\"Eleanor,\" spelt Tommy. \"Any sons or daughters over twenty-one?\"\\n\"Naow.\"\\n\"Thank you.\" Tommy closed the notebook with a brisk snap. \"Good\\nmorning.\"\\nThe servant volunteered her first remark:\\n\"I thought perhaps as you\\'d come about the gas,\" she observed\\ncryptically, and shut the door.\\nTommy rejoined his accomplice.\\n\"You see, Tuppence,\" he observed. \"Child\\'s play to the masculine\\nmind.\"\\n\"I don\\'t mind admitting that for once you\\'ve scored handsomely. I\\nshould never have thought of that.\"\\n\"Good wheeze, wasn\\'t it? And we can repeat it ad lib.\"\\nLunch-time found the young couple attacking a steak and chips in\\nan obscure hostelry with avidity. They had collected a Gladys\\nMary and a Marjorie, been baffled by one change of address, and\\nhad been forced to listen to a long lecture on universal suffrage\\nfrom a vivacious American lady whose Christian name had proved to\\nbe Sadie.\\n\"Ah!\" said Tommy, imbibing a long draught of beer, \"I feel\\nbetter. Where\\'s the next draw?\"\\nThe notebook lay on the table between them. Tuppence picked it\\nup.\\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer,\" she read, \"20 South Audley Mansions. Miss\\nWheeler, 43 Clapington Road, Battersea. She\\'s a lady\\'s maid, as\\nfar as I remember, so probably won\\'t be there, and, anyway, she\\'s\\nnot likely.\"\\n\"Then the Mayfair lady is clearly indicated as the first port of\\ncall.\"\\n\"Tommy, I\\'m getting discouraged.\"\\n\"Buck up, old bean. We always knew it was an outside chance.\\nAnd, anyway, we\\'re only starting. If we draw a blank in London,\\nthere\\'s a fine tour of England, Ireland and Scotland before us.\"\\n\"True,\" said Tuppence, her flagging spirits reviving. \"And all\\nexpenses paid! But, oh, Tommy, I do like things to happen\\nquickly. So far, adventure has succeeded adventure, but this\\nmorning has been dull as dull.\"\\n\"You must stifle this longing for vulgar sensation, Tuppence.\\nRemember that if Mr. Brown is all he is reported to be, it\\'s a\\nwonder that he has not ere now done us to death. That\\'s a good\\nsentence, quite a literary flavour about it.\"\\n\"You\\'re really more conceited than I am--with less excuse! Ahem!\\nBut it certainly is queer that Mr. Brown has not yet wreaked\\nvengeance upon us. (You see, I can do it too.) We pass on our way\\nunscathed.\"\\n\"Perhaps he doesn\\'t think us worth bothering about,\" suggested\\nthe young man simply.\\nTuppence received the remark with great disfavour.\\n\"How horrid you are, Tommy. Just as though we didn\\'t count.\"\\n\"Sorry, Tuppence. What I meant was that we work like moles in\\nthe dark, and that he has no suspicion of our nefarious schemes.\\nHa ha!\"\\n\"Ha ha!\" echoed Tuppence approvingly, as she rose.\\nSouth Audley Mansions was an imposing-looking block of flats just\\noff Park Lane. No. 20 was on the second floor.\\nTommy had by this time the glibness born of practice. He rattled\\noff the formula to the elderly woman, looking more like a\\nhousekeeper than a servant, who opened the door to him.\\n\"Christian name?\"\\n\"Margaret.\"\\nTommy spelt it, but the other interrupted him.\\n\"No, G U E.\"\\n\"Oh, Marguerite; French way, I see.\" He paused, then plunged\\nboldly. \"We had her down as Rita Vandemeyer, but I suppose that\\'s\\nincorrect?\"\\n\"She\\'s mostly called that, sir, but Marguerite\\'s her name.\"\\n\"Thank you. That\\'s all. Good morning.\"\\nHardly able to contain his excitement, Tommy hurried down the\\nstairs. Tuppence was waiting at the angle of the turn.\\n\"You heard?\"\\n\"Yes. Oh, TOMMY!\"\\nTommy squeezed her arm sympathetically.\\n\"I know, old thing. I feel the same.\"\\n\"It\\'s--it\\'s so lovely to think of things--and then for them\\nreally to happen!\" cried Tuppence enthusiastically.\\nHer hand was still in Tommy\\'s. They had reached the entrance\\nhall. There were footsteps on the stairs above them, and voices.\\nSuddenly, to Tommy\\'s complete surprise, Tuppence dragged him into\\nthe little space by the side of the lift where the shadow was\\ndeepest.\\n\"What the----\"\\n\"Hush!\"\\nTwo men came down the stairs and passed out through the entrance.\\nTuppence\\'s hand closed tighter on Tommy\\'s arm.\\n\"Quick--follow them. I daren\\'t. He might recognize me. I don\\'t\\nknow who the other man is, but the bigger of the two was\\nWhittington.\"\\nCHAPTER VII\\nTHE HOUSE IN SOHO\\nWHITTINGTON and his companion were walking at a good pace. Tommy\\nstarted in pursuit at once, and was in time to see them turn the\\ncorner of the street. His vigorous strides soon enabled him to\\ngain upon them, and by the time he, in his turn, reached the\\ncorner the distance between them was sensibly lessened. The small\\nMayfair streets were comparatively deserted, and he judged it\\nwise to content himself with keeping them in sight.\\nThe sport was a new one to him. Though familiar with the\\ntechnicalities from a course of novel reading, he had never\\nbefore attempted to \"follow\" anyone, and it appeared to him at\\nonce that, in actual practice, the proceeding was fraught with\\ndifficulties. Supposing, for instance, that they should suddenly\\nhail a taxi? In books, you simply leapt into another, promised\\nthe driver a sovereign--or its modern equivalent--and there you\\nwere. In actual fact, Tommy foresaw that it was extremely likely\\nthere would be no second taxi. Therefore he would have to run.\\nWhat happened in actual fact to a young man who ran incessantly\\nand persistently through the London streets? In a main road he\\nmight hope to create the illusion that he was merely running for\\na bus. But in these obscure aristocratic byways he could not but\\nfeel that an officious policeman might stop him to explain\\nmatters.\\nAt this juncture in his thoughts a taxi with flag erect turned\\nthe corner of the street ahead. Tommy held his breath. Would\\nthey hail it?\\nHe drew a sigh of relief as they allowed it to pass unchallenged.\\nTheir course was a zigzag one designed to bring them as quickly\\nas possible to Oxford Street. When at length they turned into\\nit, proceeding in an easterly direction, Tommy slightly increased\\nhis pace. Little by little he gained upon them. On the crowded\\npavement there was little chance of his attracting their notice,\\nand he was anxious if possible to catch a word or two of their\\nconversation. In this he was completely foiled; they spoke low\\nand the din of the traffic drowned their voices effectually.\\nJust before the Bond Street Tube station they crossed the road,\\nTommy, unperceived, faithfully at their heels, and entered the\\nbig Lyons\\'. There they went up to the first floor, and sat at a\\nsmall table in the window. It was late, and the place was\\nthinning out. Tommy took a seat at the table next to them,\\nsitting directly behind Whittington in case of recognition. On\\nthe other hand, he had a full view of the second man and studied\\nhim attentively. He was fair, with a weak, unpleasant face, and\\nTommy put him down as being either a Russian or a Pole. He was\\nprobably about fifty years of age, his shoulders cringed a little\\nas he talked, and his eyes, small and crafty, shifted\\nunceasingly.\\nHaving already lunched heartily, Tommy contented himself with\\nordering a Welsh rarebit and a cup of coffee. Whittington\\nordered a substantial lunch for himself and his companion; then,\\nas the waitress withdrew, he moved his chair a little closer to\\nthe table and began to talk earnestly in a low voice. The other\\nman joined in. Listen as he would, Tommy could only catch a word\\nhere and there; but the gist of it seemed to be some directions\\nor orders which the big man was impressing on his companion, and\\nwith which the latter seemed from time to time to disagree.\\nWhittington addressed the other as Boris.\\nTommy caught the word \"Ireland\" several times, also \"propaganda,\"\\nbut of Jane Finn there was no mention. Suddenly, in a lull in\\nthe clatter of the room, he got one phrase entire. Whittington\\nwas speaking. \"Ah, but you don\\'t know Flossie. She\\'s a marvel.\\nAn archbishop would swear she was his own mother. She gets the\\nvoice right every time, and that\\'s really the principal thing.\"\\nTommy did not hear Boris\\'s reply, but in response to it\\nWhittington said something that sounded like: \"Of course--only\\nin an emergency....\"\\nThen he lost the thread again. But presently the phrases became\\ndistinct again whether because the other two had insensibly\\nraised their voices, or because Tommy\\'s ears were getting more\\nattuned, he could not tell. But two words certainly had a most\\nstimulating effect upon the listener. They were uttered by Boris\\nand they were: \"Mr. Brown.\"\\nWhittington seemed to remonstrate with him, but he merely\\nlaughed.\\n\"Why not, my friend? It is a name most respectable--most common.\\nDid he not choose it for that reason? Ah, I should like to meet\\nhim--Mr. Brown.\"\\nThere was a steely ring in Whittington\\'s voice as he replied:\\n\"Who knows? You may have met him already.\"\\n\"Bah!\" retorted the other. \"That is children\\'s talk--a fable for\\nthe police. Do you know what I say to myself sometimes? That he\\nis a fable invented by the Inner Ring, a bogy to frighten us\\nwith. It might be so.\"\\n\"And it might not.\"\\n\"I wonder ... or is it indeed true that he is with us and amongst\\nus, unknown to all but a chosen few? If so, he keeps his secret\\nwell. And the idea is a good one, yes. We never know. We look\\nat each other--ONE OF US IS MR. BROWN--which? He commands--but\\nalso he serves. Among us--in the midst of us. And no one knows\\nwhich he is....\"\\nWith an effort the Russian shook off the vagary of his fancy. He\\nlooked at his watch.\\n\"Yes,\" said Whittington. \"We might as well go.\"\\nHe called the waitress and asked for his bill. Tommy did\\nlikewise, and a few moments later was following the two men down\\nthe stairs.\\nOutside, Whittington hailed a taxi, and directed the driver to go\\nto Waterloo.\\nTaxis were plentiful here, and before Whittington\\'s had driven\\noff another was drawing up to the curb in obedience to Tommy\\'s\\nperemptory hand.\\n\"Follow that other taxi,\" directed the young man. \"Don\\'t lose\\nit.\"\\nThe elderly chauffeur showed no interest. He merely grunted and\\njerked down his flag. The drive was uneventful. Tommy\\'s taxi\\ncame to rest at the departure platform just after Whittington\\'s.\\nTommy was behind him at the booking-office. He took a first-class\\nsingle ticket to Bournemouth, Tommy did the same. As he emerged,\\nBoris remarked, glancing up at the clock: \"You are early. You\\nhave nearly half an hour.\"\\nBoris\\'s words had aroused a new train of thought in Tommy\\'s mind.\\nClearly Whittington was making the journey alone, while the other\\nremained in London. Therefore he was left with a choice as to\\nwhich he would follow. Obviously, he could not follow both of\\nthem unless----Like Boris, he glanced up at the clock, and then\\nto the announcement board of the trains. The Bournemouth train\\nleft at 3.30. It was now ten past. Whittington and Boris were\\nwalking up and down by the bookstall. He gave one doubtful look\\nat them, then hurried into an adjacent telephone box. He dared\\nnot waste time in trying to get hold of Tuppence. In all\\nprobability she was still in the neighbourhood of South Audley\\nMansions. But there remained another ally. He rang up the Ritz\\nand asked for Julius Hersheimmer. There was a click and a buzz.\\nOh, if only the young American was in his room! There was another\\nclick, and then \"Hello\" in unmistakable accents came over the\\nwire.\\n\"That you, Hersheimmer? Beresford speaking. I\\'m at Waterloo.\\nI\\'ve followed Whittington and another man here. No time to\\nexplain. Whittington\\'s off to Bournemouth by the 3.30. Can you\\nget there by then?\"\\nThe reply was reassuring.\\n\"Sure. I\\'ll hustle.\"\\nThe telephone rang off. Tommy put back the receiver with a sigh\\nof relief. His opinion of Julius\\'s power of hustling was high.\\nHe felt instinctively that the American would arrive in time.\\nWhittington and Boris were still where he had left them. If Boris\\nremained to see his friend off, all was well. Then Tommy fingered\\nhis pocket thoughtfully. In spite of the carte blanche assured\\nto him, he had not yet acquired the habit of going about with any\\nconsiderable sum of money on him. The taking of the first-class\\nticket to Bournemouth had left him with only a few shillings in\\nhis pocket. It was to be hoped that Julius would arrive better\\nprovided.\\nIn the meantime, the minutes were creeping by: 3.15, 3.20, 3.25,\\n3.27. Supposing Julius did not get there in time. 3.29.... Doors\\nwere banging. Tommy felt cold waves of despair pass over him.\\nThen a hand fell on his shoulder.\\n\"Here I am, son. Your British traffic beats description! Put me\\nwise to the crooks right away.\"\\n\"That\\'s Whittington--there, getting in now, that big dark man.\\nThe other is the foreign chap he\\'s talking to.\"\\n\"I\\'m on to them. Which of the two is my bird?\"\\nTommy had thought out this question.\\n\"Got any money with you?\"\\nJulius shook his head, and Tommy\\'s face fell.\\n\"I guess I haven\\'t more than three or four hundred dollars with\\nme at the moment,\" explained the American.\\nTommy gave a faint whoop of relief.\\n\"Oh, Lord, you millionaires! You don\\'t talk the same language!\\nClimb aboard the lugger. Here\\'s your ticket. Whittington\\'s your\\nman.\"\\n\"Me for Whittington!\" said Julius darkly. The train was just\\nstarting as he swung himself aboard. \"So long, Tommy.\" The\\ntrain slid out of the station.\\nTommy drew a deep breath. The man Boris was coming along the\\nplatform towards him. Tommy allowed him to pass and then took up\\nthe chase once more.\\nFrom Waterloo Boris took the tube as far as Piccadilly Circus.\\nThen he walked up Shaftesbury Avenue, finally turning off into\\nthe maze of mean streets round Soho. Tommy followed him at a\\njudicious distance.\\nThey reached at length a small dilapidated square. The houses\\nthere had a sinister air in the midst of their dirt and decay.\\nBoris looked round, and Tommy drew back into the shelter of a\\nfriendly porch. The place was almost deserted. It was a\\ncul-de-sac, and consequently no traffic passed that way. The\\nstealthy way the other had looked round stimulated Tommy\\'s\\nimagination. From the shelter of the doorway he watched him go\\nup the steps of a particularly evil-looking house and rap\\nsharply, with a peculiar rhythm, on the door. It was opened\\npromptly, he said a word or two to the doorkeeper, then passed\\ninside. The door was shut to again.\\nIt was at this juncture that Tommy lost his head. What he ought\\nto have done, what any sane man would have done, was to remain\\npatiently where he was and wait for his man to come out again.\\nWhat he did do was entirely foreign to the sober common sense\\nwhich was, as a rule, his leading characteristic. Something, as\\nhe expressed it, seemed to snap in his brain. Without a moment\\'s\\npause for reflection he, too, went up the steps, and reproduced\\nas far as he was able the peculiar knock.\\nThe door swung open with the same promptness as before. A\\nvillainous-faced man with close-cropped hair stood in the\\ndoorway.\\n\"Well?\" he grunted.\\nIt was at that moment that the full realization of his folly\\nbegan to come home to Tommy. But he dared not hesitate. He\\nseized at the first words that came into his mind.\\n\"Mr. Brown?\" he said.\\nTo his surprise the man stood aside.\\n\"Upstairs,\" he said, jerking his thumb over his shoulder, \"second\\ndoor on your left.\"\\nCHAPTER VIII\\nTHE ADVENTURES OF TOMMY\\nTAKEN aback though he was by the man\\'s words, Tommy did not\\nhesitate. If audacity had successfully carried him so far, it was\\nto be hoped it would carry him yet farther. He quietly passed\\ninto the house and mounted the ramshackle staircase. Everything\\nin the house was filthy beyond words. The grimy paper, of a\\npattern now indistinguishable, hung in loose festoons from the\\nwall. In every angle was a grey mass of cobweb.\\nTommy proceeded leisurely. By the time he reached the bend of\\nthe staircase, he had heard the man below disappear into a back\\nroom. Clearly no suspicion attached to him as yet. To come to\\nthe house and ask for \"Mr. Brown\" appeared indeed to be a\\nreasonable and natural proceeding.\\nAt the top of the stairs Tommy halted to consider his next move.\\nIn front of him ran a narrow passage, with doors opening on\\neither side of it. From the one nearest him on the left came a\\nlow murmur of voices. It was this room which he had been\\ndirected to enter. But what held his glance fascinated was a\\nsmall recess immediately on his right, half concealed by a torn\\nvelvet curtain. It was directly opposite the left-handed door\\nand, owing to its angle, it also commanded a good view of the\\nupper part of the staircase. As a hiding-place for one or, at a\\npinch, two men, it was ideal, being about two feet deep and three\\nfeet wide. It attracted Tommy mightily. He thought things over\\nin his usual slow and steady way, deciding that the mention of\\n\"Mr. Brown\" was not a request for an individual, but in all\\nprobability a password used by the gang. His lucky use of it had\\ngained him admission. So far he had aroused no suspicion. But he\\nmust decide quickly on his next step.\\nSuppose he were boldly to enter the room on the left of the\\npassage. Would the mere fact of his having been admitted to the\\nhouse be sufficient? Perhaps a further password would be\\nrequired, or, at any rate, some proof of identity. The\\ndoorkeeper clearly did not know all the members of the gang by\\nsight, but it might be different upstairs. On the whole it seemed\\nto him that luck had served him very well so far, but that there\\nwas such a thing as trusting it too far. To enter that room was a\\ncolossal risk. He could not hope to sustain his part\\nindefinitely; sooner or later he was almost bound to betray\\nhimself, and then he would have thrown away a vital chance in\\nmere foolhardiness.\\nA repetition of the signal knock sounded on the door below, and\\nTommy, his mind made up, slipped quickly into the recess, and\\ncautiously drew the curtain farther across so that it shielded\\nhim completely from sight. There were several rents and slits in\\nthe ancient material which afforded him a good view. He would\\nwatch events, and any time he chose could, after all, join the\\nassembly, modelling his behaviour on that of the new arrival.\\nThe man who came up the staircase with a furtive, soft-footed\\ntread was quite unknown to Tommy. He was obviously of the very\\ndregs of society. The low beetling brows, and the criminal jaw,\\nthe bestiality of the whole countenance were new to the young\\nman, though he was a type that Scotland Yard would have\\nrecognized at a glance.\\nThe man passed the recess, breathing heavily as he went. He\\nstopped at the door opposite, and gave a repetition of the signal\\nknock. A voice inside called out something, and the man opened\\nthe door and passed in, affording Tommy a momentary glimpse of\\nthe room inside. He thought there must be about four or five\\npeople seated round a long table that took up most of the space,\\nbut his attention was caught and held by a tall man with\\nclose-cropped hair and a short, pointed, naval-looking beard, who\\nsat at the head of the table with papers in front of him. As the\\nnew-comer entered he glanced up, and with a correct, but\\ncuriously precise enunciation, which attracted Tommy\\'s notice, he\\nasked:\\n\"Your number, comrade?\"\\n\"Fourteen, gov\\'nor,\" replied the other hoarsely.\\n\"Correct.\"\\nThe door shut again.\\n\"If that isn\\'t a Hun, I\\'m a Dutchman!\" said Tommy to himself.\\n\"And running the show darned systematically too--as they always\\ndo. Lucky I didn\\'t roll in. I\\'d have given the wrong number, and\\nthere would have been the deuce to pay. No, this is the place\\nfor me. Hullo, here\\'s another knock.\"\\nThis visitor proved to be of an entirely different type to the\\nlast. Tommy recognized in him an Irish Sinn Feiner. Certainly\\nMr. Brown\\'s organization was a far-reaching concern. The common\\ncriminal, the well-bred Irish gentleman, the pale Russian, and\\nthe efficient German master of the ceremonies! Truly a strange\\nand sinister gathering! Who was this man who held in his finger\\nthese curiously variegated links of an unknown chain?\\nIn this case, the procedure was exactly the same. The signal\\nknock, the demand for a number, and the reply \"Correct.\"\\nTwo knocks followed in quick succession on the door below. The\\nfirst man was quite unknown to Tommy, who put him down as a city\\nclerk. A quiet, intelligent-looking man, rather shabbily dressed.\\nThe second was of the working classes, and his face was vaguely\\nfamiliar to the young man.\\nThree minutes later came another, a man of commanding appearance,\\nexquisitely dressed, and evidently well born. His face, again,\\nwas not unknown to the watcher, though he could not for the\\nmoment put a name to it.\\nAfter his arrival there was a long wait. In fact Tommy concluded\\nthat the gathering was now complete, and was just cautiously\\ncreeping out from his hiding-place, when another knock sent him\\nscuttling back to cover.\\nThis last-comer came up the stairs so quietly that he was almost\\nabreast of Tommy before the young man had realized his presence.\\nHe was a small man, very pale, with a gentle almost womanish air.\\nThe angle of the cheek-bones hinted at his Slavonic ancestry,\\notherwise there was nothing to indicate his nationality. As he\\npassed the recess, he turned his head slowly. The strange light\\neyes seemed to burn through the curtain; Tommy could hardly\\nbelieve that the man did not know he was there and in spite of\\nhimself he shivered. He was no more fanciful than the majority of\\nyoung Englishmen, but he could not rid himself of the impression\\nthat some unusually potent force emanated from the man. The\\ncreature reminded him of a venomous snake.\\nA moment later his impression was proved correct. The new-comer\\nknocked on the door as all had done, but his reception was very\\ndifferent. The bearded man rose to his feet, and all the others\\nfollowed suit. The German came forward and shook hands. His\\nheels clicked together.\\n\"We are honoured,\" he said. \"We are greatly honoured. I much\\nfeared that it would be impossible.\"\\nThe other answered in a low voice that had a kind of hiss in it:\\n\"There were difficulties. It will not be possible again, I fear.\\nBut one meeting is essential--to define my policy. I can do\\nnothing without--Mr. Brown. He is here?\"\\nThe change in the German\\'s voice was audible as he replied with\\nslight hesitation:\\n\"We have received a message. It is impossible for him to be\\npresent in person.\" He stopped, giving a curious impression of\\nhaving left the sentence unfinished.\\nA very slow smile overspread the face of the other. He looked\\nround at a circle of uneasy faces.\\n\"Ah! I understand. I have read of his methods. He works in the\\ndark and trusts no one. But, all the same, it is possible that\\nhe is among us now....\" He looked round him again, and again that\\nexpression of fear swept over the group. Each man seemed eyeing\\nhis neighbour doubtfully.\\nThe Russian tapped his cheek.\\n\"So be it. Let us proceed.\"\\nThe German seemed to pull himself together. He indicated the\\nplace he had been occupying at the head of the table. The Russian\\ndemurred, but the other insisted.\\n\"It is the only possible place,\" he said, \"for--Number One.\\nPerhaps Number Fourteen will shut the door?\"\\nIn another moment Tommy was once more confronting bare wooden\\npanels, and the voices within had sunk once more to a mere\\nundistinguishable murmur. Tommy became restive. The conversation\\nhe had overheard had stimulated his curiosity. He felt that, by\\nhook or by crook, he must hear more.\\nThere was no sound from below, and it did not seem likely that\\nthe doorkeeper would come upstairs. After listening intently for\\na minute or two, he put his head round the curtain. The passage\\nwas deserted. Tommy bent down and removed his shoes, then,\\nleaving them behind the curtain, he walked gingerly out on his\\nstockinged feet, and kneeling down by the closed door he laid his\\near cautiously to the crack. To his intense annoyance he could\\ndistinguish little more; just a chance word here and there if a\\nvoice was raised, which merely served to whet his curiosity still\\nfarther.\\nHe eyed the handle of the door tentatively. Could he turn it by\\ndegrees so gently and imperceptibly that those in the room would\\nnotice nothing? He decided that with great care it could be\\ndone. Very slowly, a fraction of an inch at a time, he moved it\\nround, holding his breath in his excessive care. A little more--a\\nlittle more still--would it never be finished? Ah! at last it\\nwould turn no farther.\\nHe stayed so for a minute or two, then drew a deep breath, and\\npressed it ever so slightly inward. The door did not budge.\\nTommy was annoyed. If he had to use too much force, it would\\nalmost certainly creak. He waited until the voices rose a little,\\nthen he tried again. Still nothing happened. He increased the\\npressure. Had the beastly thing stuck? Finally, in desperation,\\nhe pushed with all his might. But the door remained firm, and at\\nlast the truth dawned upon him. It was locked or bolted on the\\ninside.\\nFor a moment or two Tommy\\'s indignation got the better of him.\\n\"Well, I\\'m damned!\" he said. \"What a dirty trick!\"\\nAs his indignation cooled, he prepared to face the situation.\\nClearly the first thing to be done was to restore the handle to\\nits original position. If he let it go suddenly, the men inside\\nwould be almost certain to notice it, so, with the same infinite\\npains, he reversed his former tactics. All went well, and with a\\nsigh of relief the young man rose to his feet. There was a\\ncertain bulldog tenacity about Tommy that made him slow to admit\\ndefeat. Checkmated for the moment, he was far from abandoning the\\nconflict. He still intended to hear what was going on in the\\nlocked room. As one plan had failed, he must hunt about for\\nanother.\\nHe looked round him. A little farther along the passage on the\\nleft was a second door. He slipped silently along to it. He\\nlistened for a moment or two, then tried the handle. It yielded,\\nand he slipped inside.\\nThe room, which was untenanted, was furnished as a bedroom. Like\\neverything else in the house, the furniture was falling to\\npieces, and the dirt was, if anything, more abundant.\\nBut what interested Tommy was the thing he had hoped to find, a\\ncommunicating door between the two rooms, up on the left by the\\nwindow. Carefully closing the door into the passage behind him,\\nhe stepped across to the other and examined it closely. The bolt\\nwas shot across it. It was very rusty, and had clearly not been\\nused for some time. By gently wriggling it to and fro, Tommy\\nmanaged to draw it back without making too much noise. Then he\\nrepeated his former manoeuvres with the handle--this time with\\ncomplete success. The door swung open--a crack, a mere fraction,\\nbut enough for Tommy to hear what went on. There was a velvet\\nportiere on the inside of this door which prevented him from\\nseeing, but he was able to recognize the voices with a reasonable\\namount of accuracy.\\nThe Sinn Feiner was speaking. His rich Irish voice was\\nunmistakable:\\n\"That\\'s all very well. But more money is essential. No money--no\\nresults!\"\\nAnother voice which Tommy rather thought was that of Boris\\nreplied:\\n\"Will you guarantee that there ARE results?\"\\n\"In a month from now--sooner or later as you wish--I will\\nguarantee you such a reign of terror in Ireland as shall shake\\nthe British Empire to its foundations.\"\\nThere was a pause, and then came the soft, sibilant accents of\\nNumber One:\\n\"Good! You shall have the money. Boris, you will see to that.\"\\nBoris asked a question:\\n\"Via the Irish Americans, and Mr. Potter as usual?\"\\n\"I guess that\\'ll be all right!\" said a new voice, with a\\ntransatlantic intonation, \"though I\\'d like to point out, here and\\nnow, that things are getting a mite difficult. There\\'s not the\\nsympathy there was, and a growing disposition to let the Irish\\nsettle their own affairs without interference from America.\"\\nTommy felt that Boris had shrugged his shoulders as he answered:\\n\"Does that matter, since the money only nominally comes from the\\nStates?\"\\n\"The chief difficulty is the landing of the ammunition,\" said the\\nSinn Feiner. \"The money is conveyed in easily enough--thanks to\\nour colleague here.\"\\nAnother voice, which Tommy fancied was that of the tall,\\ncommanding-looking man whose face had seemed familiar to him,\\nsaid:\\n\"Think of the feelings of Belfast if they could hear you!\"\\n\"That is settled, then,\" said the sibilant tones. \"Now, in the\\nmatter of the loan to an English newspaper, you have arranged the\\ndetails satisfactorily, Boris?\"\\n\"I think so.\"\\n\"That is good. An official denial from Moscow will be\\nforthcoming if necessary.\"\\nThere was a pause, and then the clear voice of the German broke\\nthe silence:\\n\"I am directed by--Mr. Brown, to place the summaries of the\\nreports from the different unions before you. That of the miners\\nis most satisfactory. We must hold back the railways. There may\\nbe trouble with the A.S.E.\"\\nFor a long time there was a silence, broken only by the rustle of\\npapers and an occasional word of explanation from the German.\\nThen Tommy heard the light tap-tap of fingers, drumming on the\\ntable.\\n\"And--the date, my friend?\" said Number One.\\n\"The 29th.\"\\nThe Russian seemed to consider:\\n\"That is rather soon.\"\\n\"I know. But it was settled by the principal Labour leaders, and\\nwe cannot seem to interfere too much. They must believe it to be\\nentirely their own show.\"\\nThe Russian laughed softly, as though amused.\\n\"Yes, yes,\" he said. \"That is true. They must have no inkling\\nthat we are using them for our own ends. They are honest\\nmen--and that is their value to us. It is curious--but you\\ncannot make a revolution without honest men. The instinct of the\\npopulace is infallible.\" He paused, and then repeated, as though\\nthe phrase pleased him: \"Every revolution has had its honest\\nmen. They are soon disposed of afterwards.\"\\nThere was a sinister note in his voice.\\nThe German resumed:\\n\"Clymes must go. He is too far-seeing. Number Fourteen will see\\nto that.\"\\nThere was a hoarse murmur.\\n\"That\\'s all right, gov\\'nor.\" And then after a moment or two:\\n\"Suppose I\\'m nabbed.\"\\n\"You will have the best legal talent to defend you,\" replied the\\nGerman quietly. \"But in any case you will wear gloves fitted\\nwith the finger-prints of a notorious housebreaker. You have\\nlittle to fear.\"\\n\"Oh, I ain\\'t afraid, gov\\'nor. All for the good of the cause. The\\nstreets is going to run with blood, so they say.\" He spoke with a\\ngrim relish. \"Dreams of it, sometimes, I does. And diamonds and\\npearls rolling about in the gutter for anyone to pick up!\"\\nTommy heard a chair shifted. Then Number One spoke:\\n\"Then all is arranged. We are assured of success?\"\\n\"I--think so.\" But the German spoke with less than his usual\\nconfidence.\\nNumber One\\'s voice held suddenly a dangerous quality:\\n\"What has gone wrong?\"\\n\"Nothing; but----\"\\n\"But what?\"\\n\"The Labour leaders. Without them, as you say, we can do\\nnothing. If they do not declare a general strike on the 29th----\"\\n\"Why should they not?\"\\n\"As you\\'ve said, they\\'re honest. And, in spite of everything\\nwe\\'ve done to discredit the Government in their eyes, I\\'m not\\nsure that they haven\\'t got a sneaking faith and belief in it.\"\\n\"But----\"\\n\"I know. They abuse it unceasingly. But, on the whole, public\\nopinion swings to the side of the Government. They will not go\\nagainst it.\"\\nAgain the Russian\\'s fingers drummed on the table.\\n\"To the point, my friend. I was given to understand that there\\nwas a certain document in existence which assured success.\"\\n\"That is so. If that document were placed before the leaders,\\nthe result would be immediate. They would publish it broadcast\\nthroughout England, and declare for the revolution without a\\nmoment\\'s hesitation. The Government would be broken finally and\\ncompletely.\"\\n\"Then what more do you want?\"\\n\"The document itself,\" said the German bluntly.\\n\"Ah! It is not in your possession? But you know where it is?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"Does anyone know where it is?\"\\n\"One person--perhaps. And we are not sure of that even.\"\\n\"Who is this person?\"\\n\"A girl.\"\\nTommy held his breath.\\n\"A girl?\" The Russian\\'s voice rose contemptuously. \"And you have\\nnot made her speak? In Russia we have ways of making a girl\\ntalk.\"\\n\"This case is different,\" said the German sullenly.\\n\"How--different?\" He paused a moment, then went on: \"Where is\\nthe girl now?\"\\n\"The girl?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"She is----\"\\nBut Tommy heard no more. A crashing blow descended on his head,\\nand all was darkness.\\nCHAPTER IX\\nTUPPENCE ENTERS DOMESTIC SERVICE\\nWHEN Tommy set forth on the trail of the two men, it took all\\nTuppence\\'s self-command to refrain from accompanying him.\\nHowever, she contained herself as best she might, consoled by the\\nreflection that her reasoning had been justified by events. The\\ntwo men had undoubtedly come from the second floor flat, and that\\none slender thread of the name \"Rita\" had set the Young\\nAdventurers once more upon the track of the abductors of Jane\\nFinn.\\nThe question was what to do next? Tuppence hated letting the\\ngrass grow under her feet. Tommy was amply employed, and\\ndebarred from joining him in the chase, the girl felt at a loose\\nend. She retraced her steps to the entrance hall of the mansions.\\nIt was now tenanted by a small lift-boy, who was polishing brass\\nfittings, and whistling the latest air with a good deal of vigour\\nand a reasonable amount of accuracy.\\nHe glanced round at Tuppence\\'s entry. There was a certain amount\\nof the gamin element in the girl, at all events she invariably\\ngot on well with small boys. A sympathetic bond seemed instantly\\nto be formed. She reflected that an ally in the enemy\\'s camp, so\\nto speak, was not to be despised.\\n\"Well, William,\" she remarked cheerfully, in the best approved\\nhospital-early-morning style, \"getting a good shine up?\"\\nThe boy grinned responsively.\\n\"Albert, miss,\" he corrected.\\n\"Albert be it,\" said Tuppence. She glanced mysteriously round\\nthe hall. The effect was purposely a broad one in case Albert\\nshould miss it. She leaned towards the boy and dropped her voice:\\n\"I want a word with you, Albert.\"\\nAlbert ceased operations on the fittings and opened his mouth\\nslightly.\\n\"Look! Do you know what this is?\" With a dramatic gesture she\\nflung back the left side of her coat and exposed a small\\nenamelled badge. It was extremely unlikely that Albert would have\\nany knowledge of it--indeed, it would have been fatal for\\nTuppence\\'s plans, since the badge in question was the device of a\\nlocal training corps originated by the archdeacon in the early\\ndays of the war. Its presence in Tuppence\\'s coat was due to the\\nfact that she had used it for pinning in some flowers a day or\\ntwo before. But Tuppence had sharp eyes, and had noted the corner\\nof a threepenny detective novel protruding from Albert\\'s pocket,\\nand the immediate enlargement of his eyes told her that her\\ntactics were good, and that the fish would rise to the bait.\\n\"American Detective Force!\" she hissed.\\nAlbert fell for it.\\n\"Lord!\" he murmured ecstatically.\\nTuppence nodded at him with the air of one who has established a\\nthorough understanding.\\n\"Know who I\\'m after?\" she inquired genially.\\nAlbert, still round-eyed, demanded breathlessly:\\n\"One of the flats?\"\\nTuppence nodded and jerked a thumb up the stairs.\\n\"No. 20. Calls herself Vandemeyer. Vandemeyer! Ha! ha!\"\\nAlbert\\'s hand stole to his pocket.\\n\"A crook?\" he queried eagerly.\\n\"A crook? I should say so. Ready Rita they call her in the\\nStates.\"\\n\"Ready Rita,\" repeated Albert deliriously. \"Oh, ain\\'t it just\\nlike the pictures!\"\\nIt was. Tuppence was a great frequenter of the kinema.\\n\"Annie always said as how she was a bad lot,\" continued the boy.\\n\"Who\\'s Annie?\" inquired Tuppence idly.\\n\" \\'Ouse-parlourmaid. She\\'s leaving to-day. Many\\'s the time\\nAnnie\\'s said to me: \\'Mark my words, Albert, I wouldn\\'t wonder if\\nthe police was to come after her one of these days.\\' dust like\\nthat. But she\\'s a stunner to look at, ain\\'t she?\"\\n\"She\\'s some peach,\" allowed Tuppence carelessly. \"Finds it\\nuseful in her lay-out, you bet. Has she been wearing any of the\\nemeralds, by the way?\"\\n\"Emeralds? Them\\'s the green stones, isn\\'t they?\"\\nTuppence nodded.\\n\"That\\'s what we\\'re after her for. You know old man Rysdale?\"\\nAlbert shook his head.\\n\"Peter B. Rysdale, the oil king?\"\\n\"It seems sort of familiar to me.\"\\n\"The sparklers belonged to him. Finest collection of emeralds in\\nthe world. Worth a million dollars!\"\\n\"Lumme!\" came ecstatically from Albert. \"It sounds more like the\\npictures every minute.\"\\nTuppence smiled, gratified at the success of her efforts.\\n\"We haven\\'t exactly proved it yet. But we\\'re after her.\\nAnd\"--she produced a long-drawn-out wink--\"I guess she won\\'t get\\naway with the goods this time.\"\\nAlbert uttered another ejaculation indicative of delight.\\n\"Mind you, sonny, not a word of this,\" said Tuppence suddenly. \"I\\nguess I oughtn\\'t to have put you wise, but in the States we know\\na real smart lad when we see one.\"\\n\"I\\'ll not breathe a word,\" protested Albert eagerly. \"Ain\\'t there\\nanything I could do? A bit of shadowing, maybe, or such like?\"\\nTuppence affected to consider, then shook her head.\\n\"Not at the moment, but I\\'ll bear you in mind, son. What\\'s this\\nabout the girl you say is leaving?\"\\n\"Annie? Regular turn up, they \\'ad. As Annie said, servants is\\nsome one nowadays, and to be treated accordingly, and, what with\\nher passing the word round, she won\\'t find it so easy to get\\nanother.\"\\n\"Won\\'t she?\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. \"I wonder----\"\\nAn idea was dawning in her brain. She thought a minute or two,\\nthen tapped Albert on the shoulder.\\n\"See here, son, my brain\\'s got busy. How would it be if you\\nmentioned that you\\'d got a young cousin, or a friend of yours\\nhad, that might suit the place. You get me?\"\\n\"I\\'m there,\" said Albert instantly. \"You leave it to me, miss,\\nand I\\'ll fix the whole thing up in two ticks.\"\\n\"Some lad!\" commented Tuppence, with a nod of approval. \"You\\nmight say that the young woman could come in right away. You let\\nme know, and if it\\'s O.K. I\\'ll be round to-morrow at eleven\\no\\'clock.\"\\n\"Where am I to let you know to?\"\\n\"Ritz,\" replied Tuppence laconically. \"Name of Cowley.\"\\nAlbert eyed her enviously.\\n\"It must be a good job, this tec business.\"\\n\"It sure is,\" drawled Tuppence, \"especially when old man Rysdale\\nbacks the bill. But don\\'t fret, son. If this goes well, you\\nshall come in on the ground floor.\"\\nWith which promise she took leave of her new ally, and walked\\nbriskly away from South Audley Mansions, well pleased with her\\nmorning\\'s work.\\nBut there was no time to be lost. She went straight back to the\\nRitz and wrote a few brief words to Mr. Carter. Having\\ndispatched this, and Tommy not having yet returned--which did not\\nsurprise her--she started off on a shopping expedition which,\\nwith an interval for tea and assorted creamy cakes, occupied her\\nuntil well after six o\\'clock, and she returned to the hotel\\njaded, but satisfied with her purchases. Starting with a cheap\\nclothing store, and passing through one or two second-hand\\nestablishments, she had finished the day at a well-known\\nhairdresser\\'s. Now, in the seclusion of her bedroom, she\\nunwrapped that final purchase. Five minutes later she smiled\\ncontentedly at her reflection in the glass. With an actress\\'s\\npencil she had slightly altered the line of her eyebrows, and\\nthat, taken in conjunction with the new luxuriant growth of fair\\nhair above, so changed her appearance that she felt confident\\nthat even if she came face to face with Whittington he would not\\nrecognize her. She would wear elevators in her shoes, and the\\ncap and apron would be an even more valuable disguise. From\\nhospital experience she knew only too well that a nurse out of\\nuniform is frequently unrecognized by her patients.\\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence aloud, nodding at the pert reflection in the\\nglass, \"you\\'ll do.\" She then resumed her normal appearance.\\nDinner was a solitary meal. Tuppence was rather surprised at\\nTommy\\'s non-return. Julius, too, was absent--but that to the\\ngirl\\'s mind was more easily explained. His \"hustling\" activities\\nwere not confined to London, and his abrupt appearances and\\ndisappearances were fully accepted by the Young Adventurers as\\npart of the day\\'s work. It was quite on the cards that Julius P.\\nHersheimmer had left for Constantinople at a moment\\'s notice if\\nhe fancied that a clue to his cousin\\'s disappearance was to be\\nfound there. The energetic young man had succeeded in making the\\nlives of several Scotland Yard men unbearable to them, and the\\ntelephone girls at the Admiralty had learned to know and dread\\nthe familiar \"Hullo!\" He had spent three hours in Paris hustling\\nthe Prefecture, and had returned from there imbued with the idea,\\npossibly inspired by a weary French official, that the true clue\\nto the mystery was to be found in Ireland.\\n\"I dare say he\\'s dashed off there now,\" thought Tuppence. \"All\\nvery well, but this is very dull for ME! Here I am bursting with\\nnews, and absolutely no one to tell it to! Tommy might have\\nwired, or something. I wonder where he is. Anyway, he can\\'t have\\n\\'lost the trail\\' as they say. That reminds me----\" And Miss\\nCowley broke off in her meditations, and summoned a small boy.\\nTen minutes later the lady was ensconced comfortably on her bed,\\nsmoking cigarettes and deep in the perusal of Garnaby Williams,\\nthe Boy Detective, which, with other threepenny works of lurid\\nfiction, she had sent out to purchase. She felt, and rightly,\\nthat before the strain of attempting further intercourse with\\nAlbert, it would be as well to fortify herself with a good supply\\nof local colour.\\nThe morning brought a note from Mr. Carter:\\n\"DEAR MISS TUPPENCE,\\n\"You have made a splendid start, and I congratulate you. I feel,\\nthough, that I should like to point out to you once more the\\nrisks you are running, especially if you pursue the course you\\nindicate. Those people are absolutely desperate and incapable of\\neither mercy or pity. I feel that you probably underestimate the\\ndanger, and therefore warn you again that I can promise you no\\nprotection. You have given us valuable information, and if you\\nchoose to withdraw now no one could blame you. At any rate,\\nthink the matter over well before you decide.\\n\"If, in spite of my warnings, you make up your mind to go through\\nwith it, you will find everything arranged. You have lived for\\ntwo years with Miss Dufferin, The Parsonage, Llanelly, and Mrs.\\nVandemeyer can apply to her for a reference.\\n\"May I be permitted a word or two of advice? Stick as near to\\nthe truth as possible--it minimizes the danger of \\'slips.\\' I\\nsuggest that you should represent yourself to be what you are, a\\nformer V.A.D., who has chosen domestic service as a profession.\\nThere are many such at the present time. That explains away any\\nincongruities of voice or manner which otherwise might awaken\\nsuspicion.\\n\"Whichever way you decide, good luck to you.\\n\"Your sincere friend, \"MR. CARTER.\"\\nTuppence\\'s spirits rose mercurially. Mr. Carter\\'s warnings\\npassed unheeded. The young lady had far too much confidence in\\nherself to pay any heed to them.\\nWith some reluctance she abandoned the interesting part she had\\nsketched out for herself. Although she had no doubts of her own\\npowers to sustain a role indefinitely, she had too much common\\nsense not to recognize the force of Mr. Carter\\'s arguments.\\nThere was still no word or message from Tommy, but the morning\\npost brought a somewhat dirty postcard with the words: \"It\\'s\\nO.K.\" scrawled upon it.\\nAt ten-thirty Tuppence surveyed with pride a slightly battered\\ntin trunk containing her new possessions. It was artistically\\ncorded. It was with a slight blush that she rang the bell and\\nordered it to be placed in a taxi. She drove to Paddington, and\\nleft the box in the cloak room. She then repaired with a handbag\\nto the fastnesses of the ladies\\' waiting-room. Ten minutes later\\na metamorphosed Tuppence walked demurely out of the station and\\nentered a bus.\\nIt was a few minutes past eleven when Tuppence again entered the\\nhall of South Audley Mansions. Albert was on the look-out,\\nattending to his duties in a somewhat desultory fashion. He did\\nnot immediately recognize Tuppence. When he did, his admiration\\nwas unbounded.\\n\"Blest if I\\'d have known you! That rig-out\\'s top-hole.\"\\n\"Glad you like it, Albert,\" replied Tuppence modestly. \"By the\\nway, am I your cousin, or am I not?\"\\n\"Your voice too,\" cried the delighted boy. \"It\\'s as English as\\nanything! No, I said as a friend of mine knew a young gal. Annie\\nwasn\\'t best pleased. She\\'s stopped on till to-day--to oblige, SHE\\nsaid, but really it\\'s so as to put you against the place.\"\\n\"Nice girl,\" said Tuppence.\\nAlbert suspected no irony.\\n\"She\\'s style about her, and keeps her silver a treat--but, my\\nword, ain\\'t she got a temper. Are you going up now, miss? Step\\ninside the lift. No. 20 did you say?\" And he winked.\\nTuppence quelled him with a stern glance, and stepped inside.\\nAs she rang the bell of No. 20 she was conscious of Albert\\'s eyes\\nslowly descending beneath the level of the floor.\\nA smart young woman opened the door.\\n\"I\\'ve come about the place,\" said Tuppence.\\n\"It\\'s a rotten place,\" said the young woman without hesitation.\\n\"Regular old cat--always interfering. Accused me of tampering\\nwith her letters. Me! The flap was half undone anyway. There\\'s\\nnever anything in the waste-paper basket--she burns everything.\\nShe\\'s a wrong \\'un, that\\'s what she is. Swell clothes, but no\\nclass. Cook knows something about her--but she won\\'t\\ntell--scared to death of her. And suspicious! She\\'s on to you in\\na minute if you as much as speak to a fellow. I can tell you----\"\\nBut what more Annie could tell, Tuppence was never destined to\\nlearn, for at that moment a clear voice with a peculiarly steely\\nring to it called:\\n\"Annie!\"\\nThe smart young woman jumped as if she had been shot.\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am.\"\\n\"Who are you talking to?\"\\n\"It\\'s a young woman about the situation, ma\\'am.\"\\n\"Show her in then. At once.\"\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am.\"\\nTuppence was ushered into a room on the right of the long\\npassage. A woman was standing by the fireplace. She was no\\nlonger in her first youth, and the beauty she undeniably\\npossessed was hardened and coarsened. In her youth she must have\\nbeen dazzling. Her pale gold hair, owing a slight assistance to\\nart, was coiled low on her neck, her eyes, of a piercing electric\\nblue, seemed to possess a faculty of boring into the very soul of\\nthe person she was looking at. Her exquisite figure was enhanced\\nby a wonderful gown of indigo charmeuse. And yet, despite her\\nswaying grace, and the almost ethereal beauty of her face, you\\nfelt instinctively the presence of something hard and menacing, a\\nkind of metallic strength that found expression in the tones of\\nher voice and in that gimletlike quality of her eyes.\\nFor the first time Tuppence felt afraid. She had not feared\\nWhittington, but this woman was different. As if fascinated, she\\nwatched the long cruel line of the red curving mouth, and again\\nshe felt that sensation of panic pass over her. Her usual\\nself-confidence deserted her. Vaguely she felt that deceiving\\nthis woman would be very different to deceiving Whittington. Mr.\\nCarter\\'s warning recurred to her mind. Here, indeed, she might\\nexpect no mercy.\\nFighting down that instinct of panic which urged her to turn tail\\nand run without further delay, Tuppence returned the lady\\'s gaze\\nfirmly and respectfully.\\nAs though that first scrutiny had been satisfactory, Mrs.\\nVandemeyer motioned to a chair.\\n\"You can sit down. How did you hear I wanted a\\nhouse-parlourmaid?\"\\n\"Through a friend who knows the lift boy here. He thought the\\nplace might suit me.\"\\nAgain that basilisk glance seemed to pierce her through.\\n\"You speak like an educated girl?\"\\nGlibly enough, Tuppence ran through her imaginary career on the\\nlines suggested by Mr. Carter. It seemed to her, as she did so,\\nthat the tension of Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s attitude relaxed.\\n\"I see,\" she remarked at length. \"Is there anyone I can write to\\nfor a reference?\"\\n\"I lived last with a Miss Dufferin, The Parsonage, Llanelly. I\\nwas with her two years.\"\\n\"And then you thought you would get more money by coming to\\nLondon, I suppose? Well, it doesn\\'t matter to me. I will give\\nyou L50--L60--whatever you want. You can come in at once?\"\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am. To-day, if you like. My box is at Paddington.\"\\n\"Go and fetch it in a taxi, then. It\\'s an easy place. I am out\\na good deal. By the way, what\\'s your name?\"\\n\"Prudence Cooper, ma\\'am.\"\\n\"Very well, Prudence. Go away and fetch your box. I shall be\\nout to lunch. The cook will show you where everything is.\"\\n\"Thank you, ma\\'am.\"\\nTuppence withdrew. The smart Annie was not in evidence. In the\\nhall below a magnificent hall porter had relegated Albert to the\\nbackground. Tuppence did not even glance at him as she passed\\nmeekly out.\\nThe adventure had begun, but she felt less elated than she had\\ndone earlier in the morning. It crossed her mind that if the\\nunknown Jane Finn had fallen into the hands of Mrs. Vandemeyer,\\nit was likely to have gone hard with her.\\nCHAPTER X\\nENTER SIR JAMES PEEL EDGERTON\\nTUPPENCE betrayed no awkwardness in her new duties. The daughters\\nof the archdeacon were well grounded in household tasks. They\\nwere also experts in training a \"raw girl,\" the inevitable result\\nbeing that the raw girl, once trained, departed elsewhere where\\nher newly acquired knowledge commanded a more substantial\\nremuneration than the archdeacon\\'s meagre purse allowed.\\nTuppence had therefore very little fear of proving inefficient.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s cook puzzled her. She evidently went in deadly\\nterror of her mistress. The girl thought it probable that the\\nother woman had some hold over her. For the rest, she cooked\\nlike a chef, as Tuppence had an opportunity of judging that\\nevening. Mrs. Vandemeyer was expecting a guest to dinner, and\\nTuppence accordingly laid the beautifully polished table for two.\\nShe was a little exercised in her own mind as to this visitor. It\\nwas highly possible that it might prove to be Whittington.\\nAlthough she felt fairly confident that he would not recognize\\nher, yet she would have been better pleased had the guest proved\\nto be a total stranger. However, there was nothing for it but to\\nhope for the best.\\nAt a few minutes past eight the front door bell rang, and\\nTuppence went to answer it with some inward trepidation. She was\\nrelieved to see that the visitor was the second of the two men\\nwhom Tommy had taken upon himself to follow.\\nHe gave his name as Count Stepanov. Tuppence announced him, and\\nMrs. Vandemeyer rose from her seat on a low divan with a quick\\nmurmur of pleasure.\\n\"It is delightful to see you, Boris Ivanovitch,\" she said.\\n\"And you, madame!\" He bowed low over her hand.\\nTuppence returned to the kitchen.\\n\"Count Stepanov, or some such,\" she remarked, and affecting a\\nfrank and unvarnished curiosity: \"Who\\'s he?\"\\n\"A Russian gentleman, I believe.\"\\n\"Come here much?\"\\n\"Once in a while. What d\\'you want to know for?\"\\n\"Fancied he might be sweet on the missus, that\\'s all,\" explained\\nthe girl, adding with an appearance of sulkiness: \"How you do\\ntake one up!\"\\n\"I\\'m not quite easy in my mind about the souffle,\" explained the\\nother.\\n\"You know something,\" thought Tuppence to herself, but aloud she\\nonly said: \"Going to dish up now? Right-o.\"\\nWhilst waiting at table, Tuppence listened closely to all that\\nwas said. She remembered that this was one of the men Tommy was\\nshadowing when she had last seen him. Already, although she\\nwould hardly admit it, she was becoming uneasy about her partner.\\nWhere was he? Why had no word of any kind come from him? She had\\narranged before leaving the Ritz to have all letters or messages\\nsent on at once by special messenger to a small stationer\\'s shop\\nnear at hand where Albert was to call in frequently. True, it was\\nonly yesterday morning that she had parted from Tommy, and she\\ntold herself that any anxiety on his behalf would be absurd.\\nStill, it was strange that he had sent no word of any kind.\\nBut, listen as she might, the conversation presented no clue.\\nBoris and Mrs. Vandemeyer talked on purely indifferent subjects:\\nplays they had seen, new dances, and the latest society gossip.\\nAfter dinner they repaired to the small boudoir where Mrs.\\nVandemeyer, stretched on the divan, looked more wickedly\\nbeautiful than ever. Tuppence brought in the coffee and liqueurs\\nand unwillingly retired. As she did so, she heard Boris say:\\n\"New, isn\\'t she?\"\\n\"She came in to-day. The other was a fiend. This girl seems all\\nright. She waits well.\"\\nTuppence lingered a moment longer by the door which she had\\ncarefully neglected to close, and heard him say:\\n\"Quite safe, I suppose?\"\\n\"Really, Boris, you are absurdly suspicious. I believe she\\'s the\\ncousin of the hall porter, or something of the kind. And nobody\\neven dreams that I have any connection with our--mutual friend,\\nMr. Brown.\"\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, be careful, Rita. That door isn\\'t shut.\"\\n\"Well, shut it then,\" laughed the woman.\\nTuppence removed herself speedily.\\nShe dared not absent herself longer from the back premises, but\\nshe cleared away and washed up with a breathless speed acquired\\nin hospital. Then she slipped quietly back to the boudoir door.\\nThe cook, more leisurely, was still busy in the kitchen and, if\\nshe missed the other, would only suppose her to be turning down\\nthe beds.\\nAlas! The conversation inside was being carried on in too low a\\ntone to permit of her hearing anything of it. She dared not\\nreopen the door, however gently. Mrs. Vandemeyer was sitting\\nalmost facing it, and Tuppence respected her mistress\\'s lynx-eyed\\npowers of observation.\\nNevertheless, she felt she would give a good deal to overhear\\nwhat was going on. Possibly, if anything unforeseen had\\nhappened, she might get news of Tommy. For some moments she\\nreflected desperately, then her face brightened. She went quickly\\nalong the passage to Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s bedroom, which had long\\nFrench windows leading on to a balcony that ran the length of the\\nflat. Slipping quickly through the window, Tuppence crept\\nnoiselessly along till she reached the boudoir window. As she had\\nthought it stood a little ajar, and the voices within were\\nplainly audible.\\nTuppence listened attentively, but there was no mention of\\nanything that could be twisted to apply to Tommy. Mrs.\\nVandemeyer and the Russian seemed to be at variance over some\\nmatter, and finally the latter exclaimed bitterly:\\n\"With your persistent recklessness, you will end by ruining us!\"\\n\"Bah!\" laughed the woman. \"Notoriety of the right kind is the\\nbest way of disarming suspicion. You will realize that one of\\nthese days--perhaps sooner than you think!\"\\n\"In the meantime, you are going about everywhere with Peel\\nEdgerton. Not only is he, perhaps, the most celebrated K.C. in\\nEngland, but his special hobby is criminology! It is madness!\"\\n\"I know that his eloquence has saved untold men from the\\ngallows,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer calmly. \"What of it? I may need\\nhis assistance in that line myself some day. If so, how fortunate\\nto have such a friend at court--or perhaps it would be more to\\nthe point to say IN court.\"\\nBoris got up and began striding up and down. He was very\\nexcited.\\n\"You are a clever woman, Rita; but you are also a fool! Be guided\\nby me, and give up Peel Edgerton.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer shook her head gently.\\n\"I think not.\"\\n\"You refuse?\" There was an ugly ring in the Russian\\'s voice.\\n\"I do.\"\\n\"Then, by Heaven,\" snarled the Russian, \"we will see----\" But\\nMrs. Vandemeyer also rose to her feet, her eyes flashing.\\n\"You forget, Boris,\" she said. \"I am accountable to no one. I\\ntake my orders only from--Mr. Brown.\"\\nThe other threw up his hands in despair.\\n\"You are impossible,\" he muttered. \"Impossible! Already it may\\nbe too late. They say Peel Edgerton can SMELL a criminal! How do\\nwe know what is at the bottom of his sudden interest in you?\\nPerhaps even now his suspicions are aroused. He guesses----\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer eyed him scornfully.\\n\"Reassure yourself, my dear Boris. He suspects nothing. With\\nless than your usual chivalry, you seem to forget that I am\\ncommonly accounted a beautiful woman. I assure you that is all\\nthat interests Peel Edgerton.\"\\nBoris shook his head doubtfully.\\n\"He has studied crime as no other man in this kingdom has studied\\nit. Do you fancy that you can deceive him?\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s eyes narrowed.\\n\"If he is all that you say--it would amuse me to try!\"\\n\"Good heavens, Rita----\"\\n\"Besides,\" added Mrs. Vandemeyer, \"he is extremely rich. I am not\\none who despises money. The \\'sinews of war,\\' you know, Boris!\"\\n\"Money--money! That is always the danger with you, Rita. I\\nbelieve you would sell your soul for money. I believe----\" He\\npaused, then in a low, sinister voice he said slowly: \"Sometimes\\nI believe that you would sell--us!\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer smiled and shrugged her shoulders.\\n\"The price, at any rate, would have to be enormous,\" she said\\nlightly. \"It would be beyond the power of anyone but a\\nmillionaire to pay.\"\\n\"Ah!\" snarled the Russian. \"You see, I was right!\"\\n\"My dear Boris, can you not take a joke?\"\\n\"Was it a joke?\"\\n\"Of course.\"\\n\"Then all I can say is that your ideas of humour are peculiar, my\\ndear Rita.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer smiled.\\n\"Let us not quarrel, Boris. Touch the bell. We will have some\\ndrinks.\"\\nTuppence beat a hasty retreat. She paused a moment to survey\\nherself in Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s long glass, and be sure that nothing\\nwas amiss with her appearance. Then she answered the bell\\ndemurely.\\nThe conversation that she had overheard, although interesting in\\nthat it proved beyond doubt the complicity of both Rita and\\nBoris, threw very little light on the present preoccupations. The\\nname of Jane Finn had not even been mentioned.\\nThe following morning a few brief words with Albert informed her\\nthat nothing was waiting for her at the stationer\\'s. It seemed\\nincredible that Tommy, if all was well with him, should not send\\nany word to her. A cold hand seemed to close round her heart....\\nSupposing ... She choked her fears down bravely. It was no good\\nworrying. But she leapt at a chance offered her by Mrs.\\nVandemeyer.\\n\"What day do you usually go out, Prudence?\"\\n\"Friday\\'s my usual day, ma\\'am.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer lifted her eyebrows.\\n\"And to-day is Friday! But I suppose you hardly wish to go out\\nto-day, as you only came yesterday.\"\\n\"I was thinking of asking you if I might, ma\\'am.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer looked at her a minute longer, and then smiled.\\n\"I wish Count Stepanov could hear you. He made a suggestion\\nabout you last night.\" Her smile broadened, catlike. \"Your\\nrequest is very--typical. I am satisfied. You do not understand\\nall this--but you can go out to-day. It makes no difference to\\nme, as I shall not be dining at home.\"\\n\"Thank you, ma\\'am.\"\\nTuppence felt a sensation of relief once she was out of the\\nother\\'s presence. Once again she admitted to herself that she was\\nafraid, horribly afraid, of the beautiful woman with the cruel\\neyes.\\nIn the midst of a final desultory polishing of her silver,\\nTuppence was disturbed by the ringing of the front door bell, and\\nwent to answer it. This time the visitor was neither Whittington\\nnor Boris, but a man of striking appearance.\\nJust a shade over average height, he nevertheless conveyed the\\nimpression of a big man. His face, clean-shaven and exquisitely\\nmobile, was stamped with an expression of power and force far\\nbeyond the ordinary. Magnetism seemed to radiate from him.\\nTuppence was undecided for the moment whether to put him down as\\nan actor or a lawyer, but her doubts were soon solved as he gave\\nher his name: Sir James Peel Edgerton.\\nShe looked at him with renewed interest. This, then, was the\\nfamous K.C. whose name was familiar all over England. She had\\nheard it said that he might one day be Prime Minister. He was\\nknown to have refused office in the interests of his profession,\\npreferring to remain a simple Member for a Scotch constituency.\\nTuppence went back to her pantry thoughtfully. The great man had\\nimpressed her. She understood Boris\\'s agitation. Peel Edgerton\\nwould not be an easy man to deceive.\\nIn about a quarter of an hour the bell rang, and Tuppence\\nrepaired to the hall to show the visitor out. He had given her a\\npiercing glance before. Now, as she handed him his hat and\\nstick, she was conscious of his eyes raking her through. As she\\nopened the door and stood aside to let him pass out, he stopped\\nin the doorway.\\n\"Not been doing this long, eh?\"\\nTuppence raised her eyes, astonished. She read in his glance\\nkindliness, and something else more difficult to fathom.\\nHe nodded as though she had answered.\\n\"V.A.D. and hard up, I suppose?\"\\n\"Did Mrs. Vandemeyer tell you that?\" asked Tuppence suspiciously.\\n\"No, child. The look of you told me. Good place here?\"\\n\"Very good, thank you, sir.\"\\n\"Ah, but there are plenty of good places nowadays. And a change\\ndoes no harm sometimes.\"\\n\"Do you mean----?\" began Tuppence.\\nBut Sir James was already on the topmost stair. He looked back\\nwith his kindly, shrewd glance.\\n\"Just a hint,\" he said. \"That\\'s all.\"\\nTuppence went back to the pantry more thoughtful than ever.\\nCHAPTER XI\\nJULIUS TELLS A STORY\\nDRESSED appropriately, Tuppence duly sallied forth for her\\n\"afternoon out.\" Albert was in temporary abeyance, but Tuppence\\nwent herself to the stationer\\'s to make quite sure that nothing\\nhad come for her. Satisfied on this point, she made her way to\\nthe Ritz. On inquiry she learnt that Tommy had not yet returned.\\nIt was the answer she had expected, but it was another nail in\\nthe coffin of her hopes. She resolved to appeal to Mr. Carter,\\ntelling him when and where Tommy had started on his quest, and\\nasking him to do something to trace him. The prospect of his aid\\nrevived her mercurial spirits, and she next inquired for Julius\\nHersheimmer. The reply she got was to the effect that he had\\nreturned about half an hour ago, but had gone out immediately.\\nTuppence\\'s spirits revived still more. It would be something to\\nsee Julius. Perhaps he could devise some plan for finding out\\nwhat had become of Tommy. She wrote her note to Mr. Carter in\\nJulius\\'s sitting-room, and was just addressing the envelope when\\nthe door burst open.\\n\"What the hell----\" began Julius, but checked himself abruptly.\\n\"I beg your pardon, Miss Tuppence. Those fools down at the\\noffice would have it that Beresford wasn\\'t here any\\nlonger--hadn\\'t been here since Wednesday. Is that so?\"\\nTuppence nodded.\\n\"You don\\'t know where he is?\" she asked faintly.\\n\"I? How should I know? I haven\\'t had one darned word from him,\\nthough I wired him yesterday morning.\"\\n\"I expect your wire\\'s at the office unopened.\"\\n\"But where is he?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know. I hoped you might.\"\\n\"I tell you I haven\\'t had one darned word from him since we\\nparted at the depot on Wednesday.\"\\n\"What depot?\"\\n\"Waterloo. Your London and South Western road.\"\\n\"Waterloo?\" frowned Tuppence.\\n\"Why, yes. Didn\\'t he tell you?\"\\n\"I haven\\'t seen him either,\" replied Tuppence impatiently. \"Go on\\nabout Waterloo. What were you doing there?\"\\n\"He gave me a call. Over the phone. Told me to get a move on,\\nand hustle. Said he was trailing two crooks.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence, her eyes opening. \"I see. Go on.\"\\n\"I hurried along right away. Beresford was there. He pointed\\nout the crooks. The big one was mine, the guy you bluffed. Tommy\\nshoved a ticket into my hand and told me to get aboard the cars.\\nHe was going to sleuth the other crook.\" Julius paused. \"I\\nthought for sure you\\'d know all this.\"\\n\"Julius,\" said Tuppence firmly, \"stop walking up and down. It\\nmakes me giddy. Sit down in that armchair, and tell me the whole\\nstory with as few fancy turns of speech as possible.\"\\nMr. Hersheimmer obeyed.\\n\"Sure,\" he said. \"Where shall I begin?\"\\n\"Where you left off. At Waterloo.\"\\n\"Well,\" began Julius, \"I got into one of your dear old-fashioned\\nfirst-class British compartments. The train was just off. First\\nthing I knew a guard came along and informed me mighty politely\\nthat I wasn\\'t in a smoking-carriage. I handed him out half a\\ndollar, and that settled that. I did a bit of prospecting along\\nthe corridor to the next coach. Whittington was there right\\nenough. When I saw the skunk, with his big sleek fat face, and\\nthought of poor little Jane in his clutches, I felt real mad that\\nI hadn\\'t got a gun with me. I\\'d have tickled him up some.\\n\"We got to Bournemouth all right. Whittington took a cab and\\ngave the name of an hotel. I did likewise, and we drove up\\nwithin three minutes of each other. He hired a room, and I hired\\none too. So far it was all plain sailing. He hadn\\'t the remotest\\nnotion that anyone was on to him. Well, he just sat around in\\nthe hotel lounge, reading the papers and so on, till it was time\\nfor dinner. He didn\\'t hurry any over that either.\\n\"I began to think that there was nothing doing, that he\\'d just\\ncome on the trip for his health, but I remembered that he hadn\\'t\\nchanged for dinner, though it was by way of being a slap-up\\nhotel, so it seemed likely enough that he\\'d be going out on his\\nreal business afterwards.\\n\"Sure enough, about nine o\\'clock, so he did. Took a car across\\nthe town--mighty pretty place by the way, I guess I\\'ll take Jane\\nthere for a spell when I find her--and then paid it off and\\nstruck out along those pine-woods on the top of the cliff. I was\\nthere too, you understand. We walked, maybe, for half an hour.\\nThere\\'s a lot of villas all the way along, but by degrees they\\nseemed to get more and more thinned out, and in the end we got to\\none that seemed the last of the bunch. Big house it was, with a\\nlot of piny grounds around it.\\n\"It was a pretty black night, and the carriage drive up to the\\nhouse was dark as pitch. I could hear him ahead, though I\\ncouldn\\'t see him. I had to walk carefully in case he might get on\\nto it that he was being followed. I turned a curve and I was\\njust in time to see him ring the bell and get admitted to the\\nhouse. I just stopped where I was. It was beginning to rain, and\\nI was soon pretty near soaked through. Also, it was almighty\\ncold.\\n\"Whittington didn\\'t come out again, and by and by I got kind of\\nrestive, and began to mouch around. All the ground floor windows\\nwere shuttered tight, but upstairs, on the first floor (it was a\\ntwo-storied house) I noticed a window with a light burning and\\nthe curtains not drawn.\\n\"Now, just opposite to that window, there was a tree growing. It\\nwas about thirty foot away from the house, maybe, and I sort of\\ngot it into my head that, if I climbed up that tree, I\\'d very\\nlikely be able to see into that room. Of course, I knew there\\nwas no reason why Whittington should be in that room rather than\\nin any other--less reason, in fact, for the betting would be on\\nhis being in one of the reception-rooms downstairs. But I guess\\nI\\'d got the hump from standing so long in the rain, and anything\\nseemed better than going on doing nothing. So I started up.\\n\"It wasn\\'t so easy, by a long chalk! The rain had made the\\nboughs mighty slippery, and it was all I could do to keep a\\nfoothold, but bit by bit I managed it, until at last there I was\\nlevel with the window.\\n\"But then I was disappointed. I was too far to the left. I could\\nonly see sideways into the room. A bit of curtain, and a yard of\\nwallpaper was all I could command. Well, that wasn\\'t any manner\\nof good to me, but just as I was going to give it up, and climb\\ndown ignominiously, some one inside moved and threw his shadow on\\nmy little bit of wall--and, by gum, it was Whittington!\\n\"After that, my blood was up. I\\'d just got to get a look into\\nthat room. It was up to me to figure out how. I noticed that\\nthere was a long branch running out from the tree in the right\\ndirection. If I could only swarm about half-way along it, the\\nproposition would be solved. But it was mighty uncertain whether\\nit would bear my weight. I decided I\\'d just got to risk that, and\\nI started. Very cautiously, inch by inch, I crawled along. The\\nbough creaked and swayed in a nasty fashion, and it didn\\'t do to\\nthink of the drop below, but at last I got safely to where I\\nwanted to be.\\n\"The room was medium-sized, furnished in a kind of bare hygienic\\nway. There was a table with a lamp on it in the middle of the\\nroom, and sitting at that table, facing towards me, was\\nWhittington right enough. He was talking to a woman dressed as a\\nhospital nurse. She was sitting with her back to me, so I\\ncouldn\\'t see her face. Although the blinds were up, the window\\nitself was shut, so I couldn\\'t catch a word of what they said.\\nWhittington seemed to be doing all the talking, and the nurse\\njust listened. Now and then she nodded, and sometimes she\\'d shake\\nher head, as though she were answering questions. He seemed very\\nemphatic--once or twice he beat with his fist on the table. The\\nrain had stopped now, and the sky was clearing in that sudden way\\nit does.\\n\"Presently, he seemed to get to the end of what he was saying.\\nHe got up, and so did she. He looked towards the window and\\nasked something--I guess it was whether it was raining. Anyway,\\nshe came right across and looked out. Just then the moon came out\\nfrom behind the clouds. I was scared the woman would catch sight\\nof me, for I was full in the moonlight. I tried to move back a\\nbit. The jerk I gave was too much for that rotten old branch.\\nWith an almighty crash, down it came, and Julius P. Hersheimmer\\nwith it!\"\\n\"Oh, Julius,\" breathed Tuppence, \"how exciting! Go on.\"\\n\"Well, luckily for me, I pitched down into a good soft bed of\\nearth--but it put me out of action for the time, sure enough. The\\nnext thing I knew, I was lying in bed with a hospital nurse (not\\nWhittington\\'s one) on one side of me, and a little black-bearded\\nman with gold glasses, and medical man written all over him, on\\nthe other. He rubbed his hands together, and raised his eyebrows\\nas I stared at him. \\'Ah!\\' he said. \\'So our young friend is\\ncoming round again. Capital. Capital.\\'\\n\"I did the usual stunt. Said: \\'What\\'s happened?\\' And \\'Where am\\nI?\\' But I knew the answer to the last well enough. There\\'s no\\nmoss growing on my brain. \\'I think that\\'ll do for the present,\\nsister,\\' said the little man, and the nurse left the room in a\\nsort of brisk well-trained way. But I caught her handing me out a\\nlook of deep curiosity as she passed through the door.\\n\"That look of hers gave me an idea. \\'Now then, doc,\\' I said, and\\ntried to sit up in bed, but my right foot gave me a nasty twinge\\nas I did so. \\'A slight sprain,\\' explained the doctor. \\'Nothing\\nserious. You\\'ll be about again in a couple of days.\\' \"\\n\"I noticed you walked lame,\" interpolated Tuppence.\\nJulius nodded, and continued:\\n\" \\'How did it happen?\\' I asked again. He replied dryly. \\'You\\nfell, with a considerable portion of one of my trees, into one of\\nmy newly planted flower-beds.\\'\\n\"I liked the man. He seemed to have a sense of humour. I felt\\nsure that he, at least, was plumb straight. \\'Sure, doc,\\' I said,\\n\\'I\\'m sorry about the tree, and I guess the new bulbs will be on\\nme. But perhaps you\\'d like to know what I was doing in your\\ngarden?\\' \\'I think the facts do call for an explanation,\\' he\\nreplied. \\'Well, to begin with, I wasn\\'t after the spoons.\\'\\n\"He smiled. \\'My first theory. But I soon altered my mind. By\\nthe way, you are an American, are you not?\\' I told him my name.\\n\\'And you?\\' \\'I am Dr. Hall, and this, as you doubtless know, is\\nmy private nursing home.\\'\\n\"I didn\\'t know, but I wasn\\'t going to put him wise. I was just\\nthankful for the information. I liked the man, and I felt he was\\nstraight, but I wasn\\'t going to give him the whole story. For one\\nthing he probably wouldn\\'t have believed it.\\n\"I made up my mind in a flash. \\'Why, doctor,\\' I said, \\'I guess I\\nfeel an almighty fool, but I owe it to you to let you know that\\nit wasn\\'t the Bill Sikes business I was up to.\\' Then I went on\\nand mumbled out something about a girl. I trotted out the stern\\nguardian business, and a nervous breakdown, and finally explained\\nthat I had fancied I recognized her among the patients at the\\nhome, hence my nocturnal adventures. I guess it was just the\\nkind of story he was expecting. \\'Quite a romance,\\' he said\\ngenially, when I\\'d finished. \\'Now, doc,\\' I went on, \\'will you be\\nfrank with me? Have you here now, or have you had here at any\\ntime, a young girl called Jane Finn?\\' He repeated the name\\nthoughtfully. \\'Jane Finn?\\' he said. \\'No.\\'\\n\"I was chagrined, and I guess I showed it. \\'You are sure?\\'\\n\\'Quite sure, Mr. Hersheimmer. It is an uncommon name, and I\\nshould not have been likely to forget it.\\'\\n\"Well, that was flat. It laid me out for a space. I\\'d kind of\\nhoped my search was at an end. \\'That\\'s that,\\' I said at last.\\n\\'Now, there\\'s another matter. When I was hugging that darned\\nbranch I thought I recognized an old friend of mine talking to\\none of your nurses.\\' I purposely didn\\'t mention any name\\nbecause, of course, Whittington might be calling himself\\nsomething quite different down here, but the doctor answered at\\nonce. \\'Mr. Whittington, perhaps?\\' \\'That\\'s the fellow,\\' I\\nreplied. \\'What\\'s he doing down here? Don\\'t tell me HIS nerves\\nare out of order?\\'\\n\"Dr. Hall laughed. \\'No. He came down to see one of my nurses,\\nNurse Edith, who is a niece of his.\\' \\'Why, fancy that!\\' I\\nexclaimed. \\'Is he still here?\\' \\'No, he went back to town almost\\nimmediately.\\' \\'What a pity!\\' I ejaculated. \\'But perhaps I could\\nspeak to his niece--Nurse Edith, did you say her name was?\\'\\n\"But the doctor shook his head. \\'I\\'m afraid that, too, is\\nimpossible. Nurse Edith left with a patient to-night also.\\' \\'I\\nseem to be real unlucky,\\' I remarked. \\'Have you Mr.\\nWhittington\\'s address in town? I guess I\\'d like to look him up\\nwhen I get back.\\' \\'I don\\'t know his address. I can write to\\nNurse Edith for it if you like.\\' I thanked him. \\'Don\\'t say who\\nit is wants it. I\\'d like to give him a little surprise.\\'\\n\"That was about all I could do for the moment. Of course, if the\\ngirl was really Whittington\\'s niece, she might be too cute to\\nfall into the trap, but it was worth trying. Next thing I did\\nwas to write out a wire to Beresford saying where I was, and that\\nI was laid up with a sprained foot, and telling him to come down\\nif he wasn\\'t busy. I had to be guarded in what I said. However,\\nI didn\\'t hear from him, and my foot soon got all right. It was\\nonly ricked, not really sprained, so to-day I said good-bye to\\nthe little doctor chap, asked him to send me word if he heard\\nfrom Nurse Edith, and came right away back to town. Say, Miss\\nTuppence, you\\'re looking mighty pale!\"\\n\"It\\'s Tommy,\" said Tuppence. \"What can have happened to him?\"\\n\"Buck up, I guess he\\'s all right really. Why shouldn\\'t he be?\\nSee here, it was a foreign-looking guy he went off after. Maybe\\nthey\\'ve gone abroad--to Poland, or something like that?\"\\nTuppence shook her head.\\n\"He couldn\\'t without passports and things. Besides I\\'ve seen\\nthat man, Boris Something, since. He dined with Mrs. Vandemeyer\\nlast night.\"\\n\"Mrs. Who?\"\\n\"I forgot. Of course you don\\'t know all that.\"\\n\"I\\'m listening,\" said Julius, and gave vent to his favourite\\nexpression. \"Put me wise.\"\\nTuppence thereupon related the events of the last two days.\\nJulius\\'s astonishment and admiration were unbounded.\\n\"Bully for you! Fancy you a menial. It just tickles me to\\ndeath!\" Then he added seriously: \"But say now, I don\\'t like it,\\nMiss Tuppence, I sure don\\'t. You\\'re just as plucky as they make\\n\\'em, but I wish you\\'d keep right out of this. These crooks we\\'re\\nup against would as soon croak a girl as a man any day.\"\\n\"Do you think I\\'m afraid?\" said Tuppence indignantly, valiantly\\nrepressing memories of the steely glitter in Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s\\neyes.\\n\"I said before you were darned plucky. But that doesn\\'t alter\\nfacts.\"\\n\"Oh, bother ME!\" said Tuppence impatiently. \"Let\\'s think about\\nwhat can have happened to Tommy. I\\'ve written to Mr. Carter\\nabout it,\" she added, and told him the gist of her letter.\\nJulius nodded gravely.\\n\"I guess that\\'s good as far as it goes. But it\\'s for us to get\\nbusy and do something.\"\\n\"What can we do?\" asked Tuppence, her spirits rising.\\n\"I guess we\\'d better get on the track of Boris. You say he\\'s\\nbeen to your place. Is he likely to come again?\"\\n\"He might. I really don\\'t know.\"\\n\"I see. Well, I guess I\\'d better buy a car, a slap-up one, dress\\nas a chauffeur and hang about outside. Then if Boris comes, you\\ncould make some kind of signal, and I\\'d trail him. How\\'s that?\"\\n\"Splendid, but he mightn\\'t come for weeks.\"\\n\"We\\'ll have to chance that. I\\'m glad you like the plan.\" He\\nrose.\\n\"Where are you going?\"\\n\"To buy the car, of course,\" replied Julius, surprised. \"What\\nmake do you like? I guess you\\'ll do some riding in it before\\nwe\\'ve finished.\"\\n\"Oh,\" said Tuppence faintly, \"I LIKE Rolls-Royces, but----\"\\n\"Sure,\" agreed Julius. \"What you say goes. I\\'ll get one.\"\\n\"But you can\\'t at once,\" cried Tuppence. \"People wait ages\\nsometimes.\"\\n\"Little Julius doesn\\'t,\" affirmed Mr. Hersheimmer. \"Don\\'t you\\nworry any. I\\'ll be round in the car in half an hour.\"\\nTuppence got up.\\n\"You\\'re awfully good, Julius. But I can\\'t help feeling that it\\'s\\nrather a forlorn hope. I\\'m really pinning my faith to Mr.\\nCarter.\"\\n\"Then I shouldn\\'t.\"\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Just an idea of mine.\"\\n\"Oh; but he must do something. There\\'s no one else. By the way,\\nI forgot to tell you of a queer thing that happened this\\nmorning.\"\\nAnd she narrated her encounter with Sir James Peel Edgerton.\\nJulius was interested.\\n\"What did the guy mean, do you think?\" he asked.\\n\"I don\\'t quite know,\" said Tuppence meditatively. \"But I think\\nthat, in an ambiguous, legal, without prejudishish lawyer\\'s way,\\nhe was trying to warn me.\"\\n\"Why should he?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" confessed Tuppence. \"But he looked kind, and\\nsimply awfully clever. I wouldn\\'t mind going to him and telling\\nhim everything.\"\\nSomewhat to her surprise, Julius negatived the idea sharply.\\n\"See here,\" he said, \"we don\\'t want any lawyers mixed up in this.\\nThat guy couldn\\'t help us any.\"\\n\"Well, I believe he could,\" reiterated Tuppence obstinately.\\n\"Don\\'t you think it. So long. I\\'ll be back in half an hour.\"\\nThirty-five minutes had elapsed when Julius returned. He took\\nTuppence by the arm, and walked her to the window.\\n\"There she is.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence with a note of reverence in her voice, as she\\ngazed down at the enormous car.\\n\"She\\'s some pace-maker, I can tell you,\" said Julius\\ncomplacently.\\n\"How did you get it?\" gasped Tuppence.\\n\"She was just being sent home to some bigwig.\"\\n\"Well?\"\\n\"I went round to his house,\" said Julius. \"I said that I\\nreckoned a car like that was worth every penny of twenty thousand\\ndollars. Then I told him that it was worth just about fifty\\nthousand dollars to me if he\\'d get out.\"\\n\"Well?\" said Tuppence, intoxicated.\\n\"Well,\" returned Julius, \"he got out, that\\'s all.\"\\nCHAPTER XII\\nA FRIEND IN NEED\\nFRIDAY and Saturday passed uneventfully. Tuppence had received a\\nbrief answer to her appeal from Mr. Carter. In it he pointed out\\nthat the Young Adventurers had undertaken the work at their own\\nrisk, and had been fully warned of the dangers. If anything had\\nhappened to Tommy he regretted it deeply, but he could do\\nnothing.\\nThis was cold comfort. Somehow, without Tommy, all the savour\\nwent out of the adventure, and, for the first time, Tuppence felt\\ndoubtful of success. While they had been together she had never\\nquestioned it for a minute. Although she was accustomed to take\\nthe lead, and to pride herself on her quick-wittedness, in\\nreality she had relied upon Tommy more than she realized at the\\ntime. There was something so eminently sober and clear-headed\\nabout him, his common sense and soundness of vision were so\\nunvarying, that without him Tuppence felt much like a rudderless\\nship. It was curious that Julius, who was undoubtedly much\\ncleverer than Tommy, did not give her the same feeling of\\nsupport. She had accused Tommy of being a pessimist, and it is\\ncertain that he always saw the disadvantages and difficulties\\nwhich she herself was optimistically given to overlooking, but\\nnevertheless she had really relied a good deal on his judgment.\\nHe might be slow, but he was very sure.\\nIt seemed to the girl that, for the first time, she realized the\\nsinister character of the mission they had undertaken so\\nlightheartedly. It had begun like a page of romance. Now, shorn\\nof its glamour, it seemed to be turning to grim reality.\\nTommy--that was all that mattered. Many times in the day Tuppence\\nblinked the tears out of her eyes resolutely. \"Little fool,\" she\\nwould apostrophize herself, \"don\\'t snivel. Of course you\\'re fond\\nof him. You\\'ve known him all your life. But there\\'s no need to\\nbe sentimental about it.\"\\nIn the meantime, nothing more was seen of Boris. He did not come\\nto the flat, and Julius and the car waited in vain. Tuppence\\ngave herself over to new meditations. Whilst admitting the truth\\nof Julius\\'s objections, she had nevertheless not entirely\\nrelinquished the idea of appealing to Sir James Peel Edgerton.\\nIndeed, she had gone so far as to look up his address in the Red\\nBook. Had he meant to warn her that day? If so, why? Surely she\\nwas at least entitled to demand an explanation. He had looked at\\nher so kindly. Perhaps he might tell them something concerning\\nMrs. Vandemeyer which might lead to a clue to Tommy\\'s\\nwhereabouts.\\nAnyway, Tuppence decided, with her usual shake of the shoulders,\\nit was worth trying, and try it she would. Sunday was her\\nafternoon out. She would meet Julius, persuade him to her point\\nof view, and they would beard the lion in his den.\\nWhen the day arrived Julius needed a considerable amount of\\npersuading, but Tuppence held firm. \"It can do no harm,\" was\\nwhat she always came back to. In the end Julius gave in, and\\nthey proceeded in the car to Carlton House Terrace.\\nThe door was opened by an irreproachable butler. Tuppence felt a\\nlittle nervous. After all, perhaps it WAS colossal cheek on her\\npart. She had decided not to ask if Sir James was \"at home,\" but\\nto adopt a more personal attitude.\\n\"Will you ask Sir James if I can see him for a few minutes? I\\nhave an important message for him.\"\\nThe butler retired, returning a moment or two later.\\n\"Sir James will see you. Will you step this way?\"\\nHe ushered them into a room at the back of the house, furnished\\nas a library. The collection of books was a magnificent one, and\\nTuppence noticed that all one wall was devoted to works on crime\\nand criminology. There were several deep-padded leather\\narm-chairs, and an old-fashioned open hearth. In the window was a\\nbig roll-top desk strewn with papers at which the master of the\\nhouse was sitting.\\nHe rose as they entered.\\n\"You have a message for me? Ah\"--he recognized Tuppence with a\\nsmile--\"it\\'s you, is it? Brought a message from Mrs. Vandemeyer,\\nI suppose?\"\\n\"Not exactly,\" said Tuppence. \"In fact, I\\'m afraid I only said\\nthat to be quite sure of getting in. Oh, by the way, this is Mr.\\nHersheimmer, Sir James Peel Edgerton.\"\\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" said the American, shooting out a hand.\\n\"Won\\'t you both sit down?\" asked Sir James. He drew forward two\\nchairs.\\n\"Sir James,\" said Tuppence, plunging boldly, \"I dare say you will\\nthink it is most awful cheek of me coming here like this.\\nBecause, of course, it\\'s nothing whatever to do with you, and\\nthen you\\'re a very important person, and of course Tommy and I\\nare very unimportant.\" She paused for breath.\\n\"Tommy?\" queried Sir James, looking across at the American.\\n\"No, that\\'s Julius,\" explained Tuppence. \"I\\'m rather nervous,\\nand that makes me tell it badly. What I really want to know is\\nwhat you meant by what you said to me the other day? Did you mean\\nto warn me against Mrs. Vandemeyer? You did, didn\\'t you?\"\\n\"My dear young lady, as far as I recollect I only mentioned that\\nthere were equally good situations to be obtained elsewhere.\"\\n\"Yes, I know. But it was a hint, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\"Well, perhaps it was,\" admitted Sir James gravely.\\n\"Well, I want to know more. I want to know just WHY you gave me\\na hint.\"\\nSir James smiled at her earnestness.\\n\"Suppose the lady brings a libel action against me for defamation\\nof character?\"\\n\"Of course,\" said Tuppence. \"I know lawyers are always\\ndreadfully careful. But can\\'t we say \\'without prejudice\\' first,\\nand then say just what we want to.\"\\n\"Well,\" said Sir James, still smiling, \"without prejudice, then,\\nif I had a young sister forced to earn her living, I should not\\nlike to see her in Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s service. I felt it incumbent\\non me just to give you a hint. It is no place for a young and\\ninexperienced girl. That is all I can tell you.\"\\n\"I see,\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. \"Thank you very much. But\\nI\\'m not REALLY inexperienced, you know. I knew perfectly that\\nshe was a bad lot when I went there--as a matter of fact that\\'s\\nWHY I went----\" She broke off, seeing some bewilderment on the\\nlawyer\\'s face, and went on: \"I think perhaps I\\'d better tell you\\nthe whole story, Sir James. I\\'ve a sort of feeling that you\\'d\\nknow in a minute if I didn\\'t tell the truth, and so you might as\\nwell know all about it from the beginning. What do you think,\\nJulius?\"\\n\"As you\\'re bent on it, I\\'d go right ahead with the facts,\"\\nreplied the American, who had so far sat in silence.\\n\"Yes, tell me all about it,\" said Sir James. \"I want to know who\\nTommy is.\"\\nThus encouraged Tuppence plunged into her tale, and the lawyer\\nlistened with close attention.\\n\"Very interesting,\" he said, when she finished. \"A great deal of\\nwhat you tell me, child, is already known to me. I\\'ve had\\ncertain theories of my own about this Jane Finn. You\\'ve done\\nextraordinarily well so far, but it\\'s rather too bad of--what do\\nyou know him as?--Mr. Carter to pitchfork you two young things\\ninto an affair of this kind. By the way, where did Mr.\\nHersheimmer come in originally? You didn\\'t make that clear?\"\\nJulius answered for himself.\\n\"I\\'m Jane\\'s first cousin,\" he explained, returning the lawyer\\'s\\nkeen gaze.\\n\"Ah!\"\\n\"Oh, Sir James,\" broke out Tuppence, \"what do you think has\\nbecome of Tommy?\"\\n\"H\\'m.\" The lawyer rose, and paced slowly up and down. \"When you\\narrived, young lady, I was just packing up my traps. Going to\\nScotland by the night train for a few days\\' fishing. But there\\nare different kinds of fishing. I\\'ve a good mind to stay, and\\nsee if we can\\'t get on the track of that young chap.\"\\n\"Oh!\" Tuppence clasped her hands ecstatically.\\n\"All the same, as I said before, it\\'s too bad of--of Carter to\\nset you two babies on a job like this. Now, don\\'t get offended,\\nMiss--er----\"\\n\"Cowley. Prudence Cowley. But my friends call me Tuppence.\"\\n\"Well, Miss Tuppence, then, as I\\'m certainly going to be a\\nfriend. Don\\'t be offended because I think you\\'re young. Youth is\\na failing only too easily outgrown. Now, about this young Tommy\\nof yours----\"\\n\"Yes.\" Tuppence clasped her hands.\\n\"Frankly, things look bad for him. He\\'s been butting in\\nsomewhere where he wasn\\'t wanted. Not a doubt of it. But don\\'t\\ngive up hope.\"\\n\"And you really will help us? There, Julius! He didn\\'t want me\\nto come,\" she added by way of explanation.\\n\"H\\'m,\" said the lawyer, favouring Julius with another keen\\nglance. \"And why was that?\"\\n\"I reckoned it would be no good worrying you with a petty little\\nbusiness like this.\"\\n\"I see.\" He paused a moment. \"This petty little business, as\\nyou call it, bears directly on a very big business, bigger\\nperhaps than either you or Miss Tuppence know. If this boy is\\nalive, he may have very valuable information to give us.\\nTherefore, we must find him.\"\\n\"Yes, but how?\" cried Tuppence. \"I\\'ve tried to think of\\neverything.\"\\nSir James smiled.\\n\"And yet there\\'s one person quite near at hand who in all\\nprobability knows where he is, or at all events where he is\\nlikely to be.\"\\n\"Who is that?\" asked Tuppence, puzzled.\\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer.\"\\n\"Yes, but she\\'d never tell us.\"\\n\"Ah, that is where I come in. I think it quite likely that I\\nshall be able to make Mrs. Vandemeyer tell me what I want to\\nknow.\"\\n\"How?\" demanded Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide.\\n\"Oh, just by asking her questions,\" replied Sir James easily.\\n\"That\\'s the way we do it, you know.\"\\nHe tapped with his finger on the table, and Tuppence felt again\\nthe intense power that radiated from the man.\\n\"And if she won\\'t tell?\" asked Julius suddenly.\\n\"I think she will. I have one or two powerful levers. Still, in\\nthat unlikely event, there is always the possibility of bribery.\"\\n\"Sure. And that\\'s where I come in!\" cried Julius, bringing his\\nfist down on the table with a bang. \"You can count on me, if\\nnecessary, for one million dollars. Yes, sir, one million\\ndollars!\"\\nSir James sat down and subjected Julius to a long scrutiny.\\n\"Mr. Hersheimmer,\" he said at last, \"that is a very large sum.\"\\n\"I guess it\\'ll have to be. These aren\\'t the kind of folk to\\noffer sixpence to.\"\\n\"At the present rate of exchange it amounts to considerably over\\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand pounds.\"\\n\"That\\'s so. Maybe you think I\\'m talking through my hat, but I\\ncan deliver the goods all right, with enough over to spare for\\nyour fee.\"\\nSir James flushed slightly.\\n\"There is no question of a fee, Mr. Hersheimmer. I am not a\\nprivate detective.\"\\n\"Sorry. I guess I was just a mite hasty, but I\\'ve been feeling\\nbad about this money question. I wanted to offer a big reward\\nfor news of Jane some days ago, but your crusted institution of\\nScotland Yard advised me against it. Said it was undesirable.\"\\n\"They were probably right,\" said Sir James dryly.\\n\"But it\\'s all O.K. about Julius,\" put in Tuppence. \"He\\'s not\\npulling your leg. He\\'s got simply pots of money.\"\\n\"The old man piled it up in style,\" explained Julius. \"Now,\\nlet\\'s get down to it. What\\'s your idea?\"\\nSir James considered for a moment or two.\\n\"There is no time to be lost. The sooner we strike the better.\"\\nHe turned to Tuppence. \"Is Mrs. Vandemeyer dining out to-night,\\ndo you know?\"\\n\"Yes, I think so, but she will not be out late. Otherwise, she\\nwould have taken the latchkey.\"\\n\"Good. I will call upon her about ten o\\'clock. What time are you\\nsupposed to return?\"\\n\"About nine-thirty or ten, but I could go back earlier.\"\\n\"You must not do that on any account. It might arouse suspicion\\nif you did not stay out till the usual time. Be back by\\nnine-thirty. I will arrive at ten. Mr. Hersheimmer will wait\\nbelow in a taxi perhaps.\"\\n\"He\\'s got a new Rolls-Royce car,\" said Tuppence with vicarious\\npride.\\n\"Even better. If I succeed in obtaining the address from her, we\\ncan go there at once, taking Mrs. Vandemeyer with us if\\nnecessary. You understand?\"\\n\"Yes.\" Tuppence rose to her feet with a skip of delight. \"Oh, I\\nfeel so much better!\"\\n\"Don\\'t build on it too much, Miss Tuppence. Go easy.\"\\nJulius turned to the lawyer.\\n\"Say, then. I\\'ll call for you in the car round about\\nnine-thirty. Is that right?\"\\n\"Perhaps that will be the best plan. It would be unnecessary to\\nhave two cars waiting about. Now, Miss Tuppence, my advice to\\nyou is to go and have a good dinner, a REALLY good one, mind. And\\ndon\\'t think ahead more than you can help.\"\\nHe shook hands with them both, and a moment later they were\\noutside.\\n\"Isn\\'t he a duck?\" inquired Tuppence ecstatically, as she skipped\\ndown the steps. \"Oh, Julius, isn\\'t he just a duck?\"\\n\"Well, I allow he seems to be the goods all right. And I was\\nwrong about its being useless to go to him. Say, shall we go\\nright away back to the Ritz?\"\\n\"I must walk a bit, I think. I feel so excited. Drop me in the\\npark, will you? Unless you\\'d like to come too?\"\\n\"I want to get some petrol,\" he explained. \"And send off a cable\\nor two.\"\\n\"All right. I\\'ll meet you at the Ritz at seven. We\\'ll have to\\ndine upstairs. I can\\'t show myself in these glad rags.\"\\n\"Sure. I\\'ll get Felix help me choose the menu. He\\'s some head\\nwaiter, that. So long.\"\\nTuppence walked briskly along towards the Serpentine, first\\nglancing at her watch. It was nearly six o\\'clock. She remembered\\nthat she had had no tea, but felt too excited to be conscious of\\nhunger. She walked as far as Kensington Gardens and then slowly\\nretraced her steps, feeling infinitely better for the fresh air\\nand exercise. It was not so easy to follow Sir James\\'s advice,\\nand put the possible events of the evening out of her head. As\\nshe drew nearer and nearer to Hyde Park corner, the temptation to\\nreturn to South Audley Mansions was almost irresistible.\\nAt any rate, she decided, it would do no harm just to go and LOOK\\nat the building. Perhaps, then, she could resign herself to\\nwaiting patiently for ten o\\'clock.\\nSouth Audley Mansions looked exactly the same as usual. What\\nTuppence had expected she hardly knew, but the sight of its red\\nbrick stolidity slightly assuaged the growing and entirely\\nunreasonable uneasiness that possessed her. She was just turning\\naway when she heard a piercing whistle, and the faithful Albert\\ncame running from the building to join her.\\nTuppence frowned. It was no part of the programme to have\\nattention called to her presence in the neighbourhood, but Albert\\nwas purple with suppressed excitement.\\n\"I say, miss, she\\'s a-going!\"\\n\"Who\\'s going?\" demanded Tuppence sharply.\\n\"The crook. Ready Rita. Mrs. Vandemeyer. She\\'s a-packing up,\\nand she\\'s just sent down word for me to get her a taxi.\"\\n\"What?\" Tuppence clutched his arm.\\n\"It\\'s the truth, miss. I thought maybe as you didn\\'t know about\\nit.\"\\n\"Albert,\" cried Tuppence, \"you\\'re a brick. If it hadn\\'t been for\\nyou we\\'d have lost her.\"\\nAlbert flushed with pleasure at this tribute.\\n\"There\\'s no time to lose,\" said Tuppence, crossing the road.\\n\"I\\'ve got to stop her. At all costs I must keep her here\\nuntil----\" She broke off. \"Albert, there\\'s a telephone here,\\nisn\\'t there?\"\\nThe boy shook his head.\\n\"The flats mostly have their own, miss. But there\\'s a box just\\nround the corner.\"\\n\"Go to it then, at once, and ring up the Ritz Hotel. Ask for Mr.\\nHersheimmer, and when you get him tell him to get Sir James and\\ncome on at once, as Mrs. Vandemeyer is trying to hook it. If you\\ncan\\'t get him, ring up Sir James Peel Edgerton, you\\'ll find his\\nnumber in the book, and tell him what\\'s happening. You won\\'t\\nforget the names, will you?\"\\nAlbert repeated them glibly. \"You trust to me, miss, it\\'ll be\\nall right. But what about you? Aren\\'t you afraid to trust\\nyourself with her?\"\\n\"No, no, that\\'s all right. BUT GO AND TELEPHONE. Be quick.\"\\nDrawing a long breath, Tuppence entered the Mansions and ran up\\nto the door of No. 20. How she was to detain Mrs. Vandemeyer\\nuntil the two men arrived, she did not know, but somehow or other\\nit had to be done, and she must accomplish the task\\nsingle-handed. What had occasioned this precipitate departure?\\nDid Mrs. Vandemeyer suspect her?\\nSpeculations were idle. Tuppence pressed the bell firmly. She\\nmight learn something from the cook.\\nNothing happened and, after waiting some minutes, Tuppence\\npressed the bell again, keeping her finger on the button for some\\nlittle while. At last she heard footsteps inside, and a moment\\nlater Mrs. Vandemeyer herself opened the door. She lifted her\\neyebrows at the sight of the girl.\\n\"You?\"\\n\"I had a touch of toothache, ma\\'am,\" said Tuppence glibly. \"So\\nthought it better to come home and have a quiet evening.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer said nothing, but she drew back and let Tuppence\\npass into the hall.\\n\"How unfortunate for you,\" she said coldly. \"You had better go\\nto bed.\"\\n\"Oh, I shall be all right in the kitchen, ma\\'am. Cook will----\"\\n\"Cook is out,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer, in a rather disagreeable\\ntone. \"I sent her out. So you see you had better go to bed.\"\\nSuddenly Tuppence felt afraid. There was a ring in Mrs.\\nVandemeyer\\'s voice that she did not like at all. Also, the other\\nwoman was slowly edging her up the passage. Tuppence turned at\\nbay.\\n\"I don\\'t want----\"\\nThen, in a flash, a rim of cold steel touched her temple, and\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s voice rose cold and menacing:\\n\"You damned little fool! Do you think I don\\'t know? No, don\\'t\\nanswer. If you struggle or cry out, I\\'ll shoot you like a dog.\"\\nThe rim of steel pressed a little harder against the girl\\'s\\ntemple.\\n\"Now then, march,\" went on Mrs. Vandemeyer. \"This way--into my\\nroom. In a minute, when I\\'ve done with you, you\\'ll go to bed as I\\ntold you to. And you\\'ll sleep--oh yes, my little spy, you\\'ll\\nsleep all right!\"\\nThere was a sort of hideous geniality in the last words which\\nTuppence did not at all like. For the moment there was nothing\\nto be done, and she walked obediently into Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s\\nbedroom. The pistol never left her forehead. The room was in a\\nstate of wild disorder, clothes were flung about right and left,\\na suit-case and a hat box, half-packed, stood in the middle of\\nthe floor.\\nTuppence pulled herself together with an effort. Her voice shook\\na little, but she spoke out bravely.\\n\"Come now,\" she said. \"This is nonsense. You can\\'t shoot me.\\nWhy, every one in the building would hear the report.\"\\n\"I\\'d risk that,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer cheerfully. \"But, as long\\nas you don\\'t sing out for help, you\\'re all right--and I don\\'t\\nthink you will. You\\'re a clever girl. You deceived ME all right.\\nI hadn\\'t a suspicion of you! So I\\'ve no doubt that you understand\\nperfectly well that this is where I\\'m on top and you\\'re\\nunderneath. Now then--sit on the bed. Put your hands above your\\nhead, and if you value your life don\\'t move them.\"\\nTuppence obeyed passively. Her good sense told her that there\\nwas nothing else to do but accept the situation. If she shrieked\\nfor help there was very little chance of anyone hearing her,\\nwhereas there was probably quite a good chance of Mrs.\\nVandemeyer\\'s shooting her. In the meantime, every minute of delay\\ngained was valuable.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer laid down the revolver on the edge of the\\nwashstand within reach of her hand, and, still eyeing Tuppence\\nlike a lynx in case the girl should attempt to move, she took a\\nlittle stoppered bottle from its place on the marble and poured\\nsome of its contents into a glass which she filled up with water.\\n\"What\\'s that?\" asked Tuppence sharply.\\n\"Something to make you sleep soundly.\"\\nTuppence paled a little.\\n\"Are you going to poison me?\" she asked in a whisper.\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer, smiling agreeably.\\n\"Then I shan\\'t drink it,\" said Tuppence firmly. \"I\\'d much rather\\nbe shot. At any rate that would make a row, and some one might\\nhear it. But I won\\'t be killed off quietly like a lamb.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer stamped her foot.\\n\"Don\\'t be a little fool! Do you really think I want a hue and\\ncry for murder out after me? If you\\'ve any sense at all, you\\'ll\\nrealize that poisoning you wouldn\\'t suit my book at all. It\\'s a\\nsleeping draught, that\\'s all. You\\'ll wake up to-morrow morning\\nnone the worse. I simply don\\'t want the bother of tying you up\\nand gagging you. That\\'s the alternative--and you won\\'t like it, I\\ncan tell you! I can be very rough if I choose. So drink this\\ndown like a good girl, and you\\'ll be none the worse for it.\"\\nIn her heart of hearts Tuppence believed her. The arguments she\\nhad adduced rang true. It was a simple and effective method of\\ngetting her out of the way for the time being. Nevertheless, the\\ngirl did not take kindly to the idea of being tamely put to sleep\\nwithout as much as one bid for freedom. She felt that once Mrs.\\nVandemeyer gave them the slip, the last hope of finding Tommy\\nwould be gone.\\nTuppence was quick in her mental processes. All these\\nreflections passed through her mind in a flash, and she saw where\\na chance, a very problematical chance, lay, and she determined to\\nrisk all in one supreme effort.\\nAccordingly, she lurched suddenly off the bed and fell on her\\nknees before Mrs. Vandemeyer, clutching her skirts frantically.\\n\"I don\\'t believe it,\" she moaned. \"It\\'s poison--I know it\\'s\\npoison. Oh, don\\'t make me drink it\"--her voice rose to a\\nshriek--\"don\\'t make me drink it!\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer, glass in hand, looked down with a curling lip at\\nthis sudden collapse.\\n\"Get up, you little idiot! Don\\'t go on drivelling there. How you\\never had the nerve to play your part as you did I can\\'t think.\"\\nShe stamped her foot. \"Get up, I say.\"\\nBut Tuppence continued to cling and sob, interjecting her sobs\\nwith incoherent appeals for mercy. Every minute gained was to\\nthe good. Moreover, as she grovelled, she moved imperceptibly\\nnearer to her objective.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer gave a sharp impatient exclamation, and jerked\\nthe girl to her knees.\\n\"Drink it at once!\" Imperiously she pressed the glass to the\\ngirl\\'s lips.\\nTuppence gave one last despairing moan.\\n\"You swear it won\\'t hurt me?\" she temporized.\\n\"Of course it won\\'t hurt you. Don\\'t be a fool.\"\\n\"Will you swear it?\"\\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the other impatiently. \"I swear it.\"\\nTuppence raised a trembling left hand to the glass.\\n\"Very well.\" Her mouth opened meekly.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer gave a sigh of relief, off her guard for the\\nmoment. Then, quick as a flash, Tuppence jerked the glass upward\\nas hard as she could. The fluid in it splashed into Mrs.\\nVandemeyer\\'s face, and during her momentary gasp, Tuppence\\'s\\nright hand shot out and grasped the revolver where it lay on the\\nedge of the washstand. The next moment she had sprung back a\\npace, and the revolver pointed straight at Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s\\nheart, with no unsteadiness in the hand that held it.\\nIn the moment of victory, Tuppence betrayed a somewhat\\nunsportsmanlike triumph.\\n\"Now who\\'s on top and who\\'s underneath?\" she crowed.\\nThe other\\'s face was convulsed with rage. For a minute Tuppence\\nthought she was going to spring upon her, which would have placed\\nthe girl in an unpleasant dilemma, since she meant to draw the\\nline at actually letting off the revolver. However, with an\\neffort Mrs. Vandemeyer controlled herself, and at last a slow\\nevil smile crept over her face.\\n\"Not a fool, then, after all! You did that well, girl. But you\\nshall pay for it--oh, yes, you shall pay for it! I have a long\\nmemory!\"\\n\"I\\'m surprised you should have been gulfed so easily,\" said\\nTuppence scornfully. \"Did you really think I was the kind of\\ngirl to roll about on the floor and whine for mercy?\"\\n\"You may do--some day!\" said the other significantly.\\nThe cold malignity of her manner sent an unpleasant chill down\\nTuppence\\'s spine, but she was not going to give in to it.\\n\"Supposing we sit down,\" she said pleasantly. \"Our present\\nattitude is a little melodramatic. No--not on the bed. Draw a\\nchair up to the table, that\\'s right. Now I\\'ll sit opposite you\\nwith the revolver in front of me--just in case of accidents.\\nSplendid. Now, let\\'s talk.\"\\n\"What about?\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer sullenly.\\nTuppence eyed her thoughtfully for a minute. She was remembering\\nseveral things. Boris\\'s words, \"I believe you would sell--us!\"\\nand her answer, \"The price would have to be enormous,\" given\\nlightly, it was true, yet might not there be a substratum of\\ntruth in it? Long ago, had not Whittington asked: \"Who\\'s been\\nblabbing? Rita?\" Would Rita Vandemeyer prove to be the weak\\nspot in the armour of Mr. Brown?\\nKeeping her eyes fixed steadily on the other\\'s face, Tuppence\\nreplied quietly:\\n\"Money----\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer started. Clearly, the reply was unexpected.\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\"I\\'ll tell you. You said just now that you had a long memory. A\\nlong memory isn\\'t half as useful as a long purse! I dare say it\\nrelieves your feelings a good deal to plan out all sorts of\\ndreadful things to do to me, but is that PRACTICAL? Revenge is\\nvery unsatisfactory. Every one always says so. But\\nmoney\"--Tuppence warmed to her pet creed--\"well, there\\'s nothing\\nunsatisfactory about money, is there?\"\\n\"Do you think,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer scornfully, \"that I am the\\nkind of woman to sell my friends?\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence promptly. \"If the price was big enough.\"\\n\"A paltry hundred pounds or so!\"\\n\"No,\" said Tuppence. \"I should suggest--a hundred thousand!\"\\nHer economical spirit did not permit her to mention the whole\\nmillion dollars suggested by Julius.\\nA flush crept over Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s face.\\n\"What did you say?\" she asked, her fingers playing nervously with\\na brooch on her breast. In that moment Tuppence knew that the\\nfish was hooked, and for the first time she felt a horror of her\\nown money-loving spirit. It gave her a dreadful sense of kinship\\nto the woman fronting her.\\n\"A hundred thousand pounds,\" repeated Tuppence.\\nThe light died out of Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s eyes. She leaned back in\\nher chair.\\n\"Bah!\" she said. \"You haven\\'t got it.\"\\n\"No,\" admitted Tuppence, \"I haven\\'t--but I know some one who\\nhas.\"\\n\"Who?\"\\n\"A friend of mine.\"\\n\"Must be a millionaire,\" remarked Mrs. Vandemeyer unbelievingly.\\n\"As a matter of fact he is. He\\'s an American. He\\'ll pay you\\nthat without a murmur. You can take it from me that it\\'s a\\nperfectly genuine proposition.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer sat up again.\\n\"I\\'m inclined to believe you,\" she said slowly.\\nThere was silence between them for some time, then Mrs.\\nVandemeyer looked up.\\n\"What does he want to know, this friend of yours?\"\\nTuppence went through a momentary struggle, but it was Julius\\'s\\nmoney, and his interests must come first.\\n\"He wants to know where Jane Finn is,\" she said boldly.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer showed no surprise.\\n\"I\\'m not sure where she is at the present moment,\" she replied.\\n\"But you could find out?\"\\n\"Oh, yes,\" returned Mrs. Vandemeyer carelessly. \"There would be\\nno difficulty about that.\"\\n\"Then\"--Tuppence\\'s voice shook a little--\"there\\'s a boy, a friend\\nof mine. I\\'m afraid something\\'s happened to him, through your pal\\nBoris.\"\\n\"What\\'s his name?\"\\n\"Tommy Beresford.\"\\n\"Never heard of him. But I\\'ll ask Boris. He\\'ll tell me anything\\nhe knows.\"\\n\"Thank you.\" Tuppence felt a terrific rise in her spirits. It\\nimpelled her to more audacious efforts. \"There\\'s one thing\\nmore.\"\\n\"Well?\"\\nTuppence leaned forward and lowered her voice.\\n\"WHO IS MR. BROWN?\"\\nHer quick eyes saw the sudden paling of the beautiful face. With\\nan effort Mrs. Vandemeyer pulled herself together and tried to\\nresume her former manner. But the attempt was a mere parody.\\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\\n\"You can\\'t have learnt much about us if you don\\'t know that\\nNOBODY KNOWS WHO MR. BROWN IS....\"\\n\"You do,\" said Tuppence quietly.\\nAgain the colour deserted the other\\'s face.\\n\"What makes you think that?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said the girl truthfully. \"But I\\'m sure.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer stared in front of her for a long time.\\n\"Yes,\" she said hoarsely, at last, \"I know. I was beautiful, you\\nsee--very beautiful--\"\\n\"You are still,\" said Tuppence with admiration.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer shook her head. There was a strange gleam in her\\nelectric-blue eyes.\\n\"Not beautiful enough,\" she said in a soft dangerous voice.\\n\"Not--beautiful--enough! And sometimes, lately, I\\'ve been\\nafraid.... It\\'s dangerous to know too much!\" She leaned forward\\nacross the table. \"Swear that my name shan\\'t be brought into\\nit--that no one shall ever know.\"\\n\"I swear it. And, once\\'s he caught, you\\'ll be out of danger.\"\\nA terrified look swept across Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s face.\\n\"Shall I? Shall I ever be?\" She clutched Tuppence\\'s arm.\\n\"You\\'re sure about the money?\"\\n\"Quite sure.\"\\n\"When shall I have it? There must be no delay.\"\\n\"This friend of mine will be here presently. He may have to send\\ncables, or something like that. But there won\\'t be any\\ndelay--he\\'s a terrific hustler.\"\\nA resolute look settled on Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s face.\\n\"I\\'ll do it. It\\'s a great sum of money, and besides\"--she gave a\\ncurious smile--\"it is not--wise to throw over a woman like me!\"\\nFor a moment or two, she remained smiling, and lightly tapping\\nher fingers on the table. Suddenly she started, and her face\\nblanched.\\n\"What was that?\"\\n\"I heard nothing.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer gazed round her fearfully.\\n\"If there should be some one listening----\"\\n\"Nonsense. Who could there be?\"\\n\"Even the walls might have ears,\" whispered the other. \"I tell\\nyou I\\'m frightened. You don\\'t know him!\"\\n\"Think of the hundred thousand pounds,\" said Tuppence soothingly.\\nMrs. Vandemeyer passed her tongue over her dried lips.\\n\"You don\\'t know him,\" she reiterated hoarsely. \"He\\'s--ah!\"\\nWith a shriek of terror she sprang to her feet. Her outstretched\\nhand pointed over Tuppence\\'s head. Then she swayed to the ground\\nin a dead faint.\\nTuppence looked round to see what had startled her.\\nIn the doorway were Sir James Peel Edgerton and Julius\\nHersheimmer.\\nCHAPTER XIII\\nTHE VIGIL\\nSIR James brushed past Julius and hurriedly bent over the fallen\\nwoman.\\n\"Heart,\" he said sharply. \"Seeing us so suddenly must have given\\nher a shock. Brandy--and quickly, or she\\'ll slip through our\\nfingers.\"\\nJulius hurried to the washstand.\\n\"Not there,\" said Tuppence over her shoulder. \"In the tantalus\\nin the dining-room. Second door down the passage.\"\\nBetween them Sir James and Tuppence lifted Mrs. Vandemeyer and\\ncarried her to the bed. There they dashed water on her face, but\\nwith no result. The lawyer fingered her pulse.\\n\"Touch and go,\" he muttered. \"I wish that young fellow would\\nhurry up with the brandy.\"\\nAt that moment Julius re-entered the room, carrying a glass half\\nfull of the spirit which he handed to Sir James. While Tuppence\\nlifted her head the lawyer tried to force a little of the spirit\\nbetween her closed lips. Finally the woman opened her eyes\\nfeebly. Tuppence held the glass to her lips.\\n\"Drink this.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer complied. The brandy brought the colour back to\\nher white cheeks, and revived her in a marvellous fashion. She\\ntried to sit up--then fell back with a groan, her hand to her\\nside.\\n\"It\\'s my heart,\" she whispered. \"I mustn\\'t talk.\"\\nShe lay back with closed eyes.\\nSir James kept his finger on her wrist a minute longer, then\\nwithdrew it with a nod.\\n\"She\\'ll do now.\"\\nAll three moved away, and stood together talking in low voices.\\nOne and all were conscious of a certain feeling of anticlimax.\\nClearly any scheme for cross-questioning the lady was out of the\\nquestion for the moment. For the time being they were baffled,\\nand could do nothing.\\nTuppence related how Mrs. Vandemeyer had declared herself willing\\nto disclose the identity of Mr. Brown, and how she had consented\\nto discover and reveal to them the whereabouts of Jane Finn.\\nJulius was congratulatory.\\n\"That\\'s all right, Miss Tuppence. Splendid! I guess that\\nhundred thousand pounds will look just as good in the morning to\\nthe lady as it did over night. There\\'s nothing to worry over.\\nShe won\\'t speak without the cash anyway, you bet!\"\\nThere was certainly a good deal of common sense in this, and\\nTuppence felt a little comforted.\\n\"What you say is true,\" said Sir James meditatively. \"I must\\nconfess, however, that I cannot help wishing we had not\\ninterrupted at the minute we did. Still, it cannot be helped, it\\nis only a matter of waiting until the morning.\"\\nHe looked across at the inert figure on the bed. Mrs. Vandemeyer\\nlay perfectly passive with closed eyes. He shook his head.\\n\"Well,\" said Tuppence, with an attempt at cheerfulness, \"we must\\nwait until the morning, that\\'s all. But I don\\'t think we ought\\nto leave the flat.\"\\n\"What about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard?\"\\n\"Albert? And suppose she came round again and hooked it. Albert\\ncouldn\\'t stop her.\"\\n\"I guess she won\\'t want to make tracks away from the dollars.\"\\n\"She might. She seemed very frightened of \\'Mr. Brown.\\' \"\\n\"What? Real plumb scared of him?\"\\n\"Yes. She looked round and said even walls had ears.\"\\n\"Maybe she meant a dictaphone,\" said Julius with interest.\\n\"Miss Tuppence is right,\" said Sir James quietly. \"We must not\\nleave the flat--if only for Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s sake.\"\\nJulius stared at him.\\n\"You think he\\'d get after her? Between now and to-morrow\\nmorning. How could he know, even?\"\\n\"You forget your own suggestion of a dictaphone,\" said Sir James\\ndryly. \"We have a very formidable adversary. I believe, if we\\nexercise all due care, that there is a very good chance of his\\nbeing delivered into our hands. But we must neglect no\\nprecaution. We have an important witness, but she must be\\nsafeguarded. I would suggest that Miss Tuppence should go to\\nbed, and that you and I, Mr. Hersheimmer, should share the\\nvigil.\"\\nTuppence was about to protest, but happening to glance at the bed\\nshe saw Mrs. Vandemeyer, her eyes half-open, with such an\\nexpression of mingled fear and malevolence on her face that it\\nquite froze the words on her lips.\\nFor a moment she wondered whether the faint and the heart attack\\nhad been a gigantic sham, but remembering the deadly pallor she\\ncould hardly credit the supposition. As she looked the expression\\ndisappeared as by magic, and Mrs. Vandemeyer lay inert and\\nmotionless as before. For a moment the girl fancied she must have\\ndreamt it. But she determined nevertheless to be on the alert.\\n\"Well,\" said Julius, \"I guess we\\'d better make a move out of here\\nany way.\"\\nThe others fell in with his suggestion. Sir James again felt\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s pulse.\\n\"Perfectly satisfactory,\" he said in a low voice to Tuppence.\\n\"She\\'ll be absolutely all right after a night\\'s rest.\"\\nThe girl hesitated a moment by the bed. The intensity of the\\nexpression she had surprised had impressed her powerfully. Mrs.\\nVandemeyer lifted her lids. She seemed to be struggling to\\nspeak. Tuppence bent over her.\\n\"Don\\'t--leave----\" she seemed unable to proceed, murmuring\\nsomething that sounded like \"sleepy.\" Then she tried again.\\nTuppence bent lower still. It was only a breath.\\n\"Mr.--Brown----\" The voice stopped.\\nBut the half-closed eyes seemed still to send an agonized\\nmessage.\\nMoved by a sudden impulse, the girl said quickly:\\n\"I shan\\'t leave the flat. I shall sit up all night.\"\\nA flash of relief showed before the lids descended once more.\\nApparently Mrs. Vandemeyer slept. But her words had awakened a\\nnew uneasiness in Tuppence. What had she meant by that low\\nmurmur: \"Mr. Brown?\" Tuppence caught herself nervously looking\\nover her shoulder. The big wardrobe loomed up in a sinister\\nfashion before her eyes. Plenty of room for a man to hide in\\nthat.... Half-ashamed of herself, Tuppence pulled it open and\\nlooked inside. No one--of course! She stooped down and looked\\nunder the bed. There was no other possible hiding-place.\\nTuppence gave her familiar shake of the shoulders. It was\\nabsurd, this giving way to nerves! Slowly she went out of the\\nroom. Julius and Sir James were talking in a low voice. Sir James\\nturned to her.\\n\"Lock the door on the outside, please, Miss Tuppence, and take\\nout the key. There must be no chance of anyone entering that\\nroom.\"\\nThe gravity of his manner impressed them, and Tuppence felt less\\nashamed of her attack of \"nerves.\"\\n\"Say,\" remarked Julius suddenly, \"there\\'s Tuppence\\'s bright boy.\\nI guess I\\'d better go down and ease his young mind. That\\'s some\\nlad, Tuppence.\"\\n\"How did you get in, by the way?\" asked Tuppence suddenly. \"I\\nforgot to ask.\"\\n\"Well, Albert got me on the phone all right. I ran round for Sir\\nJames here, and we came right on. The boy was on the look out\\nfor us, and was just a mite worried about what might have\\nhappened to you. He\\'d been listening outside the door of the\\nflat, but couldn\\'t hear anything. Anyhow he suggested sending us\\nup in the coal lift instead of ringing the bell. And sure enough\\nwe landed in the scullery and came right along to find you.\\nAlbert\\'s still below, and must be just hopping mad by this time.\"\\nWith which Julius departed abruptly.\\n\"Now then, Miss Tuppence,\" said Sir James, \"you know this place\\nbetter than I do. Where do you suggest we should take up our\\nquarters?\"\\nTuppence considered for a moment or two.\\n\"I think Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s boudoir would be the most\\ncomfortable,\" she said at last, and led the way there.\\nSir James looked round approvingly.\\n\"This will do very well, and now, my dear young lady, do go to\\nbed and get some sleep.\"\\nTuppence shook her head resolutely.\\n\"I couldn\\'t, thank you, Sir James. I should dream of Mr. Brown\\nall night!\"\\n\"But you\\'ll be so tired, child.\"\\n\"No, I shan\\'t. I\\'d rather stay up--really.\"\\nThe lawyer gave in.\\nJulius reappeared some minutes later, having reassured Albert and\\nrewarded him lavishly for his services. Having in his turn failed\\nto persuade Tuppence to go to bed, he said decisively:\\n\"At any rate, you\\'ve got to have something to eat right away.\\nWhere\\'s the larder?\"\\nTuppence directed him, and he returned in a few minutes with a\\ncold pie and three plates.\\nAfter a hearty meal, the girl felt inclined to pooh-pooh her\\nfancies of half an hour before. The power of the money bribe\\ncould not fail.\\n\"And now, Miss Tuppence,\" said Sir James, \"we want to hear your\\nadventures.\"\\n\"That\\'s so,\" agreed Julius.\\nTuppence narrated her adventures with some complacence. Julius\\noccasionally interjected an admiring \"Bully.\" Sir James said\\nnothing until she had finished, when his quiet \"well done, Miss\\nTuppence,\" made her flush with pleasure.\\n\"There\\'s one thing I don\\'t get clearly,\" said Julius. \"What put\\nher up to clearing out?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" confessed Tuppence.\\nSir James stroked his chin thoughtfully.\\n\"The room was in great disorder. That looks as though her flight\\nwas unpremeditated. Almost as though she got a sudden warning to\\ngo from some one.\"\\n\"Mr. Brown, I suppose,\" said Julius scoffingly.\\nThe lawyer looked at him deliberately for a minute or two.\\n\"Why not?\" he said. \"Remember, you yourself have once been\\nworsted by him.\"\\nJulius flushed with vexation.\\n\"I feel just mad when I think of how I handed out Jane\\'s\\nphotograph to him like a lamb. Gee, if I ever lay hands on it\\nagain, I\\'ll freeze on to it like--like hell!\"\\n\"That contingency is likely to be a remote one,\" said the other\\ndryly.\\n\"I guess you\\'re right,\" said Julius frankly. \"And, in any case,\\nit\\'s the original I\\'m out after. Where do you think she can be,\\nSir James?\"\\nThe lawyer shook his head.\\n\"Impossible to say. But I\\'ve a very good idea where she has\\nbeen.\"\\n\"You have? Where?\"\\nSir James smiled.\\n\"At the scene of your nocturnal adventures, the Bournemouth\\nnursing home.\"\\n\"There? Impossible. I asked.\"\\n\"No, my dear sir, you asked if anyone of the name of Jane Finn\\nhad been there. Now, if the girl had been placed there it would\\nalmost certainly be under an assumed name.\"\\n\"Bully for you,\" cried Julius. \"I never thought of that!\"\\n\"It was fairly obvious,\" said the other.\\n\"Perhaps the doctor\\'s in it too,\" suggested Tuppence.\\nJulius shook his head.\\n\"I don\\'t think so. I took to him at once. No, I\\'m pretty sure\\nDr. Hall\\'s all right.\"\\n\"Hall, did you say?\" asked Sir James. \"That is curious--really\\nvery curious.\"\\n\"Why?\" demanded Tuppence.\\n\"Because I happened to meet him this morning. I\\'ve known him\\nslightly on and off for some years, and this morning I ran across\\nhim in the street. Staying at the Metropole, he told me.\" He\\nturned to Julius. \"Didn\\'t he tell you he was coming up to town?\"\\nJulius shook his head.\\n\"Curious,\" mused Sir James. \"You did not mention his name this\\nafternoon, or I would have suggested your going to him for\\nfurther information with my card as introduction.\"\\n\"I guess I\\'m a mutt,\" said Julius with unusual humility. \"I ought\\nto have thought of the false name stunt.\"\\n\"How could you think of anything after falling out of that tree?\"\\ncried Tuppence. \"I\\'m sure anyone else would have been killed\\nright off.\"\\n\"Well, I guess it doesn\\'t matter now, anyway,\" said Julius.\\n\"We\\'ve got Mrs. Vandemeyer on a string, and that\\'s all we need.\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence, but there was a lack of assurance in her\\nvoice.\\nA silence settled down over the party. Little by little the\\nmagic of the night began to gain a hold on them. There were\\nsudden creaks of the furniture, imperceptible rustlings in the\\ncurtains. Suddenly Tuppence sprang up with a cry.\\n\"I can\\'t help it. I know Mr. Brown\\'s somewhere in the flat! I\\ncan FEEL him.\"\\n\"Sure, Tuppence, how could he be? This door\\'s open into the\\nhall. No one could have come in by the front door without our\\nseeing and hearing him.\"\\n\"I can\\'t help it. I FEEL he\\'s here!\"\\nShe looked appealingly at Sir James, who replied gravely:\\n\"With due deference to your feelings, Miss Tuppence (and mine as\\nwell for that matter), I do not see how it is humanly possible\\nfor anyone to be in the flat without our knowledge.\"\\nThe girl was a little comforted by his wards.\\n\"Sitting up at night is always rather jumpy,\" she confessed.\\n\"Yes,\" said Sir James. \"We are in the condition of people\\nholding a seance. Perhaps if a medium were present we might get\\nsome marvellous results.\"\\n\"Do you believe in spiritualism?\" asked Tuppence, opening her\\neyes wide.\\nThe lawyer shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"There is some truth in it, without a doubt. But most of the\\ntestimony would not pass muster in the witness-box.\"\\nThe hours drew on. With the first faint glimmerings of dawn, Sir\\nJames drew aside the curtains. They beheld, what few Londoners\\nsee, the slow rising of the sun over the sleeping city. Somehow,\\nwith the coming of the light, the dreads and fancies of the past\\nnight seemed absurd. Tuppence\\'s spirits revived to the normal.\\n\"Hooray!\" she said. \"It\\'s going to be a gorgeous day. And we\\nshall find Tommy. And Jane Finn. And everything will be lovely.\\nI shall ask Mr. Carter if I can\\'t be made a Dame!\"\\nAt seven o\\'clock Tuppence volunteered to go and make some tea.\\nShe returned with a tray, containing the teapot and four cups.\\n\"Who\\'s the other cup for?\" inquired Julius.\\n\"The prisoner, of course. I suppose we might call her that?\"\\n\"Taking her tea seems a kind of anticlimax to last night,\" said\\nJulius thoughtfully.\\n\"Yes, it does,\" admitted Tuppence. \"But, anyway, here goes.\\nPerhaps you\\'d both come, too, in case she springs on me, or\\nanything. You see, we don\\'t know what mood she\\'ll wake up in.\"\\nSir James and Julius accompanied her to the door.\\n\"Where\\'s the key? Oh, of course, I\\'ve got it myself.\"\\nShe put it in the lock, and turned it, then paused.\\n\"Supposing, after all, she\\'s escaped?\" she murmured in a whisper.\\n\"Plumb impossible,\" replied Julius reassuringly.\\nBut Sir James said nothing.\\nTuppence drew a long breath and entered. She heaved a sigh of\\nrelief as she saw that Mrs. Vandemeyer was lying on the bed.\\n\"Good morning,\" she remarked cheerfully. \"I\\'ve brought you some\\ntea.\"\\nMrs. Vandemeyer did not reply. Tuppence put down the cup on the\\ntable by the bed and went across to draw up the blinds. When she\\nturned, Mrs. Vandemeyer still lay without a movement. With a\\nsudden fear clutching at her heart, Tuppence ran to the bed. The\\nhand she lifted was cold as ice.... Mrs. Vandemeyer would never\\nspeak now....\\nHer cry brought the others. A very few minutes sufficed. Mrs.\\nVandemeyer was dead--must have been dead some hours. She had\\nevidently died in her sleep.\\n\"If that isn\\'t the cruellest luck,\" cried Julius in despair.\\nThe lawyer was calmer, but there was a curious gleam in his eyes.\\n\"If it is luck,\" he replied.\\n\"You don\\'t think--but, say, that\\'s plumb impossible--no one could\\nhave got in.\"\\n\"No,\" admitted the lawyer. \"I don\\'t see how they could. And\\nyet--she is on the point of betraying Mr. Brown, and--she dies.\\nIs it only chance?\"\\n\"But how----\"\\n\"Yes, HOW! That is what we must find out.\" He stood there\\nsilently, gently stroking his chin. \"We must find out,\" he said\\nquietly, and Tuppence felt that if she was Mr. Brown she would\\nnot like the tone of those simple words.\\nJulius\\'s glance went to the window.\\n\"The window\\'s open,\" he remarked. \"Do you think----\"\\nTuppence shook her head.\\n\"The balcony only goes along as far as the boudoir. We were\\nthere.\"\\n\"He might have slipped out----\" suggested Julius.\\nBut Sir James interrupted him.\\n\"Mr. Brown\\'s methods are not so crude. In the meantime we must\\nsend for a doctor, but before we do so, is there anything in this\\nroom that might be of value to us?\"\\nHastily, the three searched. A charred mass in the grate\\nindicated that Mrs. Vandemeyer had been burning papers on the eve\\nof her flight. Nothing of importance remained, though they\\nsearched the other rooms as well.\\n\"There\\'s that,\" said Tuppence suddenly, pointing to a small,\\nold-fashioned safe let into the wall. \"It\\'s for jewellery, I\\nbelieve, but there might be something else in it.\"\\nThe key was in the lock, and Julius swung open the door, and\\nsearched inside. He was some time over the task.\\n\"Well,\" said Tuppence impatiently.\\nThere was a pause before Julius answered, then he withdrew his\\nhead and shut to the door.\\n\"Nothing,\" he said.\\nIn five minutes a brisk young doctor arrived, hastily summoned.\\nHe was deferential to Sir James, whom he recognized.\\n\"Heart failure, or possibly an overdose of some\\nsleeping-draught.\" He sniffed. \"Rather an odour of chloral in\\nthe air.\"\\nTuppence remembered the glass she had upset. A new thought drove\\nher to the washstand. She found the little bottle from which\\nMrs. Vandemeyer had poured a few drops.\\nIt had been three parts full. Now--IT WAS EMPTY.\\nCHAPTER XIV\\nA CONSULTATION\\nNOTHING was more surprising and bewildering to Tuppence than the\\nease and simplicity with which everything was arranged, owing to\\nSir James\\'s skilful handling. The doctor accepted quite readily\\nthe theory that Mrs. Vandemeyer had accidentally taken an\\noverdose of chloral. He doubted whether an inquest would be\\nnecessary. If so, he would let Sir James know. He understood\\nthat Mrs. Vandemeyer was on the eve of departure for abroad, and\\nthat the servants had already left? Sir James and his young\\nfriends had been paying a call upon her, when she was suddenly\\nstricken down and they had spent the night in the flat, not\\nliking to leave her alone. Did they know of any relatives? They\\ndid not, but Sir James referred him to Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s\\nsolicitor.\\nShortly afterwards a nurse arrived to take charge, and the other\\nleft the ill-omened building.\\n\"And what now?\" asked Julius, with a gesture of despair. \"I guess\\nwe\\'re down and out for good.\"\\nSir James stroked his chin thoughtfully.\\n\"No,\" he said quietly. \"There is still the chance that Dr. Hall\\nmay be able to tell us something.\"\\n\"Gee! I\\'d forgotten him.\"\\n\"The chance is slight, but it must not be neglected. I think I\\ntold you that he is staying at the Metropole. I should suggest\\nthat we call upon him there as soon as possible. Shall we say\\nafter a bath and breakfast?\"\\nIt was arranged that Tuppence and Julius should return to the\\nRitz, and call for Sir James in the car. This programme was\\nfaithfully carried out, and a little after eleven they drew up\\nbefore the Metropole. They asked for Dr. Hall, and a page-boy\\nwent in search of him. In a few minutes the little doctor came\\nhurrying towards them.\\n\"Can you spare us a few minutes, Dr. Hall?\" said Sir James\\npleasantly. \"Let me introduce you to Miss Cowley. Mr.\\nHersheimmer, I think, you already know.\"\\nA quizzical gleam came into the doctor\\'s eye as he shook hands\\nwith Julius.\\n\"Ah, yes, my young friend of the tree episode! Ankle all right,\\neh?\"\\n\"I guess it\\'s cured owing to your skilful treatment, doc.\"\\n\"And the heart trouble? Ha ha!\"\\n\"Still searching,\" said Julius briefly.\\n\"To come to the point, can we have a word with you in private?\"\\nasked Sir James.\\n\"Certainly. I think there is a room here where we shall be quite\\nundisturbed.\"\\nHe led the way, and the others followed him. They sat down, and\\nthe doctor looked inquiringly at Sir James.\\n\"Dr. Hall, I am very anxious to find a certain young lady for the\\npurpose of obtaining a statement from her. I have reason to\\nbelieve that she has been at one time or another in your\\nestablishment at Bournemouth. I hope I am transgressing no\\nprofessional etiquette in questioning you on the subject?\"\\n\"I suppose it is a matter of testimony?\"\\nSir James hesitated a moment, then he replied:\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"I shall be pleased to give you any information in my power. What\\nis the young lady\\'s name? Mr. Hersheimmer asked me, I\\nremember----\" He half turned to Julius.\\n\"The name,\" said Sir James bluntly, \"is really immaterial. She\\nwould be almost certainly sent to you under an assumed one. But I\\nshould like to know if you are acquainted with a Mrs.\\nVandemeyer?\"\\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer, of 20 South Audley Mansions? I know her\\nslightly.\"\\n\"You are not aware of what has happened?\"\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\"You do not know that Mrs. Vandemeyer is dead?\"\\n\"Dear, dear, I had no idea of it! When did it happen?\"\\n\"She took an overdose of chloral last night.\"\\n\"Purposely?\"\\n\"Accidentally, it is believed. I should not like to say myself.\\nAnyway, she was found dead this morning.\"\\n\"Very sad. A singularly handsome woman. I presume she was a\\nfriend of yours, since you are acquainted with all these\\ndetails.\"\\n\"I am acquainted with the details because--well, it was I who\\nfound her dead.\"\\n\"Indeed,\" said the doctor, starting.\\n\"Yes,\" said Sir James, and stroked his chin reflectively.\\n\"This is very sad news, but you will excuse me if I say that I do\\nnot see how it bears on the subject of your inquiry?\"\\n\"It bears on it in this way, is it not a fact that Mrs.\\nVandemeyer committed a young relative of hers to your charge?\"\\nJulius leaned forward eagerly.\\n\"That is the case,\" said the doctor quietly.\\n\"Under the name of----?\"\\n\"Janet Vandemeyer. I understood her to be a niece of Mrs.\\nVandemeyer\\'s.\"\\n\"And she came to you?\"\\n\"As far as I can remember in June or July of 1915.\"\\n\"Was she a mental case?\"\\n\"She is perfectly sane, if that is what you mean. I understood\\nfrom Mrs. Vandemeyer that the girl had been with her on the\\nLusitania when that ill-fated ship was sunk, and had suffered a\\nsevere shock in consequence.\"\\n\"We\\'re on the right track, I think?\" Sir James looked round.\\n\"As I said before, I\\'m a mutt!\" returned Julius.\\nThe doctor looked at them all curiously.\\n\"You spoke of wanting a statement from her,\" he said. \"Supposing\\nshe is not able to give one?\"\\n\"What? You have just said that she is perfectly sane.\"\\n\"So she is. Nevertheless, if you want a statement from her\\nconcerning any events prior to May 7, 1915, she will not be able\\nto give it to you.\"\\nThey looked at the little man, stupefied. He nodded cheerfully.\\n\"It\\'s a pity,\" he said. \"A great pity, especially as I gather,\\nSir James, that the matter is important. But there it is, she\\ncan tell you nothing.\"\\n\"But why, man? Darn it all, why?\"\\nThe little man shifted his benevolent glance to the excited young\\nAmerican.\\n\"Because Janet Vandemeyer is suffering from a complete loss of\\nmemory.\"\\n\"WHAT?\"\\n\"Quite so. An interesting case, a very interesting case. Not so\\nuncommon, really, as you would think. There are several very\\nwell known parallels. It\\'s the first case of the kind that I\\'ve\\nhad under my own personal observation, and I must admit that I\\'ve\\nfound it of absorbing interest.\" There was something rather\\nghoulish in the little man\\'s satisfaction.\\n\"And she remembers nothing,\" said Sir James slowly.\\n\"Nothing prior to May 7, 1915. After that date her memory is as\\ngood as yours or mine.\"\\n\"Then the first thing she remembers?\"\\n\"Is landing with the survivors. Everything before that is a\\nblank. She did not know her own name, or where she had come from,\\nor where she was. She couldn\\'t even speak her own tongue.\"\\n\"But surely all this is most unusual?\" put in Julius.\\n\"No, my dear sir. Quite normal under the circumstances. Severe\\nshock to the nervous system. Loss of memory proceeds nearly\\nalways on the same lines. I suggested a specialist, of course.\\nThere\\'s a very good man in Paris--makes a study of these\\ncases--but Mrs. Vandemeyer opposed the idea of publicity that\\nmight result from such a course.\"\\n\"I can imagine she would,\" said Sir James grimly.\\n\"I fell in with her views. There is a certain notoriety given to\\nthese cases. And the girl was very young--nineteen, I believe.\\nIt seemed a pity that her infirmity should be talked about--might\\ndamage her prospects. Besides, there is no special treatment to\\npursue in such cases. It is really a matter of waiting.\"\\n\"Waiting?\"\\n\"Yes, sooner or later, the memory will return--as suddenly as it\\nwent. But in all probability the girl will have entirely\\nforgotten the intervening period, and will take up life where she\\nleft off--at the sinking of the Lusitania.\"\\n\"And when do you expect this to happen?\"\\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"Ah, that I cannot say. Sometimes it is a matter of months,\\nsometimes it has been known to be as long as twenty years!\\nSometimes another shock does the trick. One restores what the\\nother took away.\"\\n\"Another shock, eh?\" said Julius thoughtfully.\\n\"Exactly. There was a case in Colorado----\" The little man\\'s\\nvoice trailed on, voluble, mildly enthusiastic.\\nJulius did not seem to be listening. He had relapsed into his\\nown thoughts and was frowning. Suddenly he came out of his brown\\nstudy, and hit the table such a resounding bang with his fist\\nthat every one jumped, the doctor most of all.\\n\"I\\'ve got it! I guess, doc, I\\'d like your medical opinion on the\\nplan I\\'m about to outline. Say Jane was to cross the herring\\npond again, and the same thing was to happen. The submarine, the\\nsinking ship, every one to take to the boats--and so on.\\nWouldn\\'t that do the trick? Wouldn\\'t it give a mighty big bump to\\nher subconscious self, or whatever the jargon is, and start it\\nfunctioning again right away?\"\\n\"A very interesting speculation, Mr. Hersheimmer. In my own\\nopinion, it would be successful. It is unfortunate that there is\\nno chance of the conditions repeating themselves as you suggest.\"\\n\"Not by nature, perhaps, doc. But I\\'m talking about art.\"\\n\"Art?\"\\n\"Why, yes. What\\'s the difficulty? Hire a liner----\"\\n\"A liner!\" murmured Dr. Hall faintly.\\n\"Hire some passengers, hire a submarine--that\\'s the only\\ndifficulty, I guess. Governments are apt to be a bit hidebound\\nover their engines of war. They won\\'t sell to the firstcomer.\\nStill, I guess that can be got over. Ever heard of the word\\n\\'graft,\\' sir? Well, graft gets there every time! I reckon that\\nwe shan\\'t really need to fire a torpedo. If every one hustles\\nround and screams loud enough that the ship is sinking, it ought\\nto be enough for an innocent young girl like Jane. By the time\\nshe\\'s got a life-belt on her, and is being hustled into a boat,\\nwith a well-drilled lot of artistes doing the hysterical stunt on\\ndeck, why--she ought to be right back where she was in May, 1915.\\nHow\\'s that for the bare outline?\"\\nDr. Hall looked at Julius. Everything that he was for the moment\\nincapable of saying was eloquent in that look.\\n\"No,\" said Julius, in answer to it, \"I\\'m not crazy. The thing\\'s\\nperfectly possible. It\\'s done every day in the States for the\\nmovies. Haven\\'t you seen trains in collision on the screen?\\nWhat\\'s the difference between buying up a train and buying up a\\nliner? Get the properties and you can go right ahead!\"\\nDr. Hall found his voice.\\n\"But the expense, my dear sir.\" His voice rose. \"The expense!\\nIt will be COLOSSAL!\"\\n\"Money doesn\\'t worry me any,\" explained Julius simply.\\nDr. Hall turned an appealing face to Sir James, who smiled\\nslightly.\\n\"Mr. Hersheimmer is very well off--very well off indeed.\"\\nThe doctor\\'s glance came back to Julius with a new and subtle\\nquality in it. This was no longer an eccentric young fellow with\\na habit of falling off trees. The doctor\\'s eyes held the\\ndeference accorded to a really rich man.\\n\"Very remarkable plan. Very remarkable,\" he murmured. \"The\\nmovies--of course! Your American word for the kinema. Very\\ninteresting. I fear we are perhaps a little behind the times over\\nhere in our methods. And you really mean to carry out this\\nremarkable plan of yours.\"\\n\"You bet your bottom dollar I do.\"\\nThe doctor believed him--which was a tribute to his nationality.\\nIf an Englishman had suggested such a thing, he would have had\\ngrave doubts as to his sanity.\\n\"I cannot guarantee a cure,\" he pointed out. \"Perhaps I ought to\\nmake that quite clear.\"\\n\"Sure, that\\'s all right,\" said Julius. \"You just trot out Jane,\\nand leave the rest to me.\"\\n\"Jane?\"\\n\"Miss Janet Vandemeyer, then. Can we get on the long distance to\\nyour place right away, and ask them to send her up; or shall I\\nrun down and fetch her in my car?\"\\nThe doctor stared.\\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Hersheimmer. I thought you understood.\"\\n\"Understood what?\"\\n\"That Miss Vandemeyer is no longer under my care.\"\\nCHAPTER XV\\nTUPPENCE RECEIVES A PROPOSAL\\nJULIUS sprang up.\\n\"What?\"\\n\"I thought you were aware of that.\"\\n\"When did she leave?\"\\n\"Let me see. To-day is Monday, is it not? It must have been\\nlast Wednesday--why, surely--yes, it was the same evening that\\nyou--er--fell out of my tree.\"\\n\"That evening? Before, or after?\"\\n\"Let me see--oh yes, afterwards. A very urgent message arrived\\nfrom Mrs. Vandemeyer. The young lady and the nurse who was in\\ncharge of her left by the night train.\"\\nJulius sank back again into his chair.\\n\"Nurse Edith--left with a patient--I remember,\" he muttered. \"My\\nGod, to have been so near!\"\\nDr. Hall looked bewildered.\\n\"I don\\'t understand. Is the young lady not with her aunt, after\\nall?\"\\nTuppence shook her head. She was about to speak when a warning\\nglance from Sir James made her hold her tongue. The lawyer rose.\\n\"I\\'m much obliged to you, Hall. We\\'re very grateful for all\\nyou\\'ve told us. I\\'m afraid we\\'re now in the position of having to\\ntrack Miss Vandemeyer anew. What about the nurse who accompanied\\nher; I suppose you don\\'t know where she is?\"\\nThe doctor shook his head.\\n\"We\\'ve not heard from her, as it happens. I understood she was\\nto remain with Miss Vandemeyer for a while. But what can have\\nhappened? Surely the girl has not been kidnapped.\"\\n\"That remains to be seen,\" said Sir James gravely.\\nThe other hesitated.\\n\"You do not think I ought to go to the police?\"\\n\"No, no. In all probability the young lady is with other\\nrelations.\"\\nThe doctor was not completely satisfied, but he saw that Sir\\nJames was determined to say no more, and realized that to try and\\nextract more information from the famous K.C. would be mere waste\\nof labour. Accordingly, he wished them goodbye, and they left the\\nhotel. For a few minutes they stood by the car talking.\\n\"How maddening,\" cried Tuppence. \"To think that Julius must have\\nbeen actually under the same roof with her for a few hours.\"\\n\"I was a darned idiot,\" muttered Julius gloomily.\\n\"You couldn\\'t know,\" Tuppence consoled him. \"Could he?\" She\\nappealed to Sir James.\\n\"I should advise you not to worry,\" said the latter kindly. \"No\\nuse crying over spilt milk, you know.\"\\n\"The great thing is what to do next,\" added Tuppence the\\npractical.\\nSir James shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"You might advertise for the nurse who accompanied the girl. That\\nis the only course I can suggest, and I must confess I do not\\nhope for much result. Otherwise there is nothing to be done.\"\\n\"Nothing?\" said Tuppence blankly. \"And--Tommy?\"\\n\"We must hope for the best,\" said Sir James. \"Oh yes, we must go\\non hoping.\"\\nBut over her downcast head his eyes met Julius\\'s, and almost\\nimperceptibly he shook his head. Julius understood. The lawyer\\nconsidered the case hopeless. The young American\\'s face grew\\ngrave. Sir James took Tuppence\\'s hand.\\n\"You must let me know if anything further comes to light. Letters\\nwill always be forwarded.\"\\nTuppence stared at him blankly.\\n\"You are going away?\"\\n\"I told you. Don\\'t you remember? To Scotland.\"\\n\"Yes, but I thought----\" The girl hesitated.\\nSir James shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"My dear young lady, I can do nothing more, I fear. Our clues\\nhave all ended in thin air. You can take my word for it that\\nthere is nothing more to be done. If anything should arise, I\\nshall be glad to advise you in any way I can.\"\\nHis words gave Tuppence an extraordinarily desolate feeling.\\n\"I suppose you\\'re right,\" she said. \"Anyway, thank you very much\\nfor trying to help us. Good-bye.\"\\nJulius was bending over the car. A momentary pity came into Sir\\nJames\\'s keen eyes, as he gazed into the girl\\'s downcast face.\\n\"Don\\'t be too disconsolate, Miss Tuppence,\" he said in a low\\nvoice. \"Remember, holiday-time isn\\'t always all playtime. One\\nsometimes manages to put in some work as well.\"\\nSomething in his tone made Tuppence glance up sharply. He shook\\nhis head with a smile.\\n\"No, I shan\\'t say any more. Great mistake to say too much.\\nRemember that. Never tell all you know--not even to the person\\nyou know best. Understand? Good-bye.\"\\nHe strode away. Tuppence stared after him. She was beginning to\\nunderstand Sir James\\'s methods. Once before he had thrown her a\\nhint in the same careless fashion. Was this a hint? What exactly\\nlay behind those last brief words? Did he mean that, after all,\\nhe had not abandoned the case; that, secretly, he would be\\nworking on it still while----\\nHer meditations were interrupted by Julius, who adjured her to\\n\"get right in.\"\\n\"You\\'re looking kind of thoughtful,\" he remarked as they started\\noff. \"Did the old guy say anything more?\"\\nTuppence opened her mouth impulsively, and then shut it again.\\nSir James\\'s words sounded in her ears: \"Never tell all you\\nknow--not even to the person you know best.\" And like a flash\\nthere came into her mind another memory. Julius before the safe\\nin the flat, her own question and the pause before his reply,\\n\"Nothing.\" Was there really nothing? Or had he found something\\nhe wished to keep to himself? If he could make a reservation, so\\ncould she.\\n\"Nothing particular,\" she replied.\\nShe felt rather than saw Julius throw a sideways glance at her.\\n\"Say, shall we go for a spin in the park?\"\\n\"If you like.\"\\nFor a while they ran on under the trees in silence. It was a\\nbeautiful day. The keen rush through the air brought a new\\nexhilaration to Tuppence.\\n\"Say, Miss Tuppence, do you think I\\'m ever going to find Jane?\"\\nJulius spoke in a discouraged voice. The mood was so alien to\\nhim that Tuppence turned and stared at him in surprise. He\\nnodded.\\n\"That\\'s so. I\\'m getting down and out over the business. Sir\\nJames to-day hadn\\'t got any hope at all, I could see that. I\\ndon\\'t like him--we don\\'t gee together somehow--but he\\'s pretty\\ncute, and I guess he wouldn\\'t quit if there was any chance of\\nsuccess--now, would he?\"\\nTuppence felt rather uncomfortable, but clinging to her belief\\nthat Julius also had withheld something from her, she remained\\nfirm.\\n\"He suggested advertising for the nurse,\" she reminded him.\\n\"Yes, with a \\'forlorn hope\\' flavour to his voice! No--I\\'m about\\nfed up. I\\'ve half a mind to go back to the States right away.\"\\n\"Oh no!\" cried Tuppence. \"We\\'ve got to find Tommy.\"\\n\"I sure forgot Beresford,\" said Julius contritely. \"That\\'s so.\\nWe must find him. But after--well, I\\'ve been day-dreaming ever\\nsince I started on this trip--and these dreams are rotten poor\\nbusiness. I\\'m quit of them. Say, Miss Tuppence, there\\'s\\nsomething I\\'d like to ask you.\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"You and Beresford. What about it?\"\\n\"I don\\'t understand you,\" replied Tuppence with dignity, adding\\nrather inconsequently: \"And, anyway, you\\'re wrong!\"\\n\"Not got a sort of kindly feeling for one another?\"\\n\"Certainly not,\" said Tuppence with warmth. \"Tommy and I are\\nfriends--nothing more.\"\\n\"I guess every pair of lovers has said that sometime or another,\"\\nobserved Julius.\\n\"Nonsense!\" snapped Tuppence. \"Do I look the sort of girl that\\'s\\nalways falling in love with every man she meets?\"\\n\"You do not. You look the sort of girl that\\'s mighty often\\ngetting fallen in love with!\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence, rather taken aback. \"That\\'s a compliment, I\\nsuppose?\"\\n\"Sure. Now let\\'s get down to this. Supposing we never find\\nBeresford and--and----\"\\n\"All right--say it! I can face facts. Supposing he\\'s--dead!\\nWell?\"\\n\"And all this business fiddles out. What are you going to do?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Tuppence forlornly.\\n\"You\\'ll be darned lonesome, you poor kid.\"\\n\"I shall be all right,\" snapped Tuppence with her usual\\nresentment of any kind of pity.\\n\"What about marriage?\" inquired Julius. \"Got any views on the\\nsubject?\"\\n\"I intend to marry, of course,\" replied Tuppence. \"That is,\\nif\"--she paused, knew a momentary longing to draw back, and then\\nstuck to her guns bravely--\"I can find some one rich enough to\\nmake it worth my while. That\\'s frank, isn\\'t it? I dare say you\\ndespise me for it.\"\\n\"I never despise business instinct,\" said Julius. \"What\\nparticular figure have you in mind?\"\\n\"Figure?\" asked Tuppence, puzzled. \"Do you mean tall or short?\"\\n\"No. Sum--income.\"\\n\"Oh, I--I haven\\'t quite worked that out.\"\\n\"What about me?\"\\n\"You?\"\\n\"Sure thing.\"\\n\"Oh, I couldn\\'t!\"\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\"I tell you I couldn\\'t.\"\\n\"Again, why not?\"\\n\"It would seem so unfair.\"\\n\"I don\\'t see anything unfair about it. I call your bluff, that\\'s\\nall. I admire you immensely, Miss Tuppence, more than any girl\\nI\\'ve ever met. You\\'re so darned plucky. I\\'d just love to give\\nyou a real, rattling good time. Say the word, and we\\'ll run\\nround right away to some high-class jeweller, and fix up the ring\\nbusiness.\"\\n\"I can\\'t,\" gasped Tuppence.\\n\"Because of Beresford?\"\\n\"No, no, NO!\"\\n\"Well then?\"\\nTuppence merely continued to shake her head violently.\\n\"You can\\'t reasonably expect more dollars than I\\'ve got.\"\\n\"Oh, it isn\\'t that,\" gasped Tuppence with an almost hysterical\\nlaugh. \"But thanking you very much, and all that, I think I\\'d\\nbetter say no.\"\\n\"I\\'d be obliged if you\\'d do me the favour to think it over until\\nto-morrow.\"\\n\"It\\'s no use.\"\\n\"Still, I guess we\\'ll leave it like that.\"\\n\"Very well,\" said Tuppence meekly.\\nNeither of them spoke again until they reached the Ritz.\\nTuppence went upstairs to her room. She felt morally battered to\\nthe ground after her conflict with Julius\\'s vigorous personality.\\nSitting down in front of the glass, she stared at her own\\nreflection for some minutes.\\n\"Fool,\" murmured Tuppence at length, making a grimace. \"Little\\nfool. Everything you want--everything you\\'ve ever hoped for, and\\nyou go and bleat out \\'no\\' like an idiotic little sheep. It\\'s your\\none chance. Why don\\'t you take it? Grab it? Snatch at it? What\\nmore do you want?\"\\nAs if in answer to her own question, her eyes fell on a small\\nsnapshot of Tommy that stood on her dressing-table in a shabby\\nframe. For a moment she struggled for self-control, and then\\nabandoning all presence, she held it to her lips and burst into a\\nfit of sobbing.\\n\"Oh, Tommy, Tommy,\" she cried, \"I do love you so--and I may never\\nsee you again....\"\\nAt the end of five minutes Tuppence sat up, blew her nose, and\\npushed back her hair.\\n\"That\\'s that,\" she observed sternly. \"Let\\'s look facts in the\\nface. I seem to have fallen in love--with an idiot of a boy who\\nprobably doesn\\'t care two straws about me.\" Here she paused.\\n\"Anyway,\" she resumed, as though arguing with an unseen opponent,\\n\"I don\\'t KNOW that he does. He\\'d never have dared to say so.\\nI\\'ve always jumped on sentiment--and here I am being more\\nsentimental than anybody. What idiots girls are! I\\'ve always\\nthought so. I suppose I shall sleep with his photograph under my\\npillow, and dream about him all night. It\\'s dreadful to feel\\nyou\\'ve been false to your principles.\"\\nTuppence shook her head sadly, as she reviewed her backsliding.\\n\"I don\\'t know what to say to Julius, I\\'m sure. Oh, what a fool I\\nfeel! I\\'ll have to say SOMETHING--he\\'s so American and thorough,\\nhe\\'ll insist upon having a reason. I wonder if he did find\\nanything in that safe----\"\\nTuppence\\'s meditations went off on another tack. She reviewed\\nthe events of last night carefully and persistently. Somehow,\\nthey seemed bound up with Sir James\\'s enigmatical words....\\nSuddenly she gave a great start--the colour faded out of her\\nface. Her eyes, fascinated, gazed in front of her, the pupils\\ndilated.\\n\"Impossible,\" she murmured. \"Impossible! I must be going mad\\neven to think of such a thing....\"\\nMonstrous--yet it explained everything....\\nAfter a moment\\'s reflection she sat down and wrote a note,\\nweighing each word as she did so. Finally she nodded her head as\\nthough satisfied, and slipped it into an envelope which she\\naddressed to Julius. She went down the passage to his\\nsitting-room and knocked at the door. As she had expected, the\\nroom was empty. She left the note on the table.\\nA small page-boy was waiting outside her own door when she\\nreturned to it.\\n\"Telegram for you, miss.\"\\nTuppence took it from the salver, and tore it open carelessly.\\nThen she gave a cry. The telegram was from Tommy!\\nCHAPTER XVI\\nFURTHER ADVENTURES OF TOMMY\\nFROM a darkness punctuated with throbbing stabs of fire, Tommy\\ndragged his senses slowly back to life. When he at last opened\\nhis eyes, he was conscious of nothing but an excruciating pain\\nthrough his temples. He was vaguely aware of unfamiliar\\nsurroundings. Where was he? What had happened? He blinked\\nfeebly. This was not his bedroom at the Ritz. And what the\\ndevil was the matter with his head?\\n\"Damn!\" said Tommy, and tried to sit up. He had remembered. He\\nwas in that sinister house in Soho. He uttered a groan and fell\\nback. Through his almost-closed lids he reconnoitred carefully.\\n\"He is coming to,\" remarked a voice very near Tommy\\'s ear. He\\nrecognized it at once for that of the bearded and efficient\\nGerman, and lay artistically inert. He felt that it would be a\\npity to come round too soon; and until the pain in his head\\nbecame a little less acute, he felt quite incapable of collecting\\nhis wits. Painfully he tried to puzzle out what had happened.\\nObviously somebody must have crept up behind him as he listened\\nand struck him down with a blow on the head. They knew him now\\nfor a spy, and would in all probability give him short shrift.\\nUndoubtedly he was in a tight place. Nobody knew where he was,\\ntherefore he need expect no outside assistance, and must depend\\nsolely on his own wits.\\n\"Well, here goes,\" murmured Tommy to himself, and repeated his\\nformer remark.\\n\"Damn!\" he observed, and this time succeeded in sitting up.\\nIn a minute the German stepped forward and placed a glass to his\\nlips, with the brief command \"Drink.\" Tommy obeyed. The potency\\nof the draught made him choke, but it cleared his brain in a\\nmarvellous manner.\\nHe was lying on a couch in the room in which the meeting had been\\nheld. On one side of him was the German, on the other the\\nvillainous-faced doorkeeper who had let him in. The others were\\ngrouped together at a little distance away. But Tommy missed one\\nface. The man known as Number One was no longer of the company.\\n\"Feel better?\" asked the German, as he removed the empty glass.\\n\"Yes, thanks,\" returned Tommy cheerfully.\\n\"Ah, my young friend, it is lucky for you your skull is so thick.\\nThe good Conrad struck hard.\" He indicated the evil-faced\\ndoorkeeper by a nod. The man grinned.\\nTommy twisted his head round with an effort.\\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"so you\\'re Conrad, are you? It strikes me the\\nthickness of my skull was lucky for you too. When I look at you I\\nfeel it\\'s almost a pity I\\'ve enabled you to cheat the hangman.\"\\nThe man snarled, and the bearded man said quietly:\\n\"He would have run no risk of that.\"\\n\"Just as you like,\" replied Tommy. \"I know it\\'s the fashion to\\nrun down the police. I rather believe in them myself.\"\\nHis manner was nonchalant to the last degree. Tommy Beresford\\nwas one of those young Englishmen not distinguished by any\\nspecial intellectual ability, but who are emphatically at their\\nbest in what is known as a \"tight place.\" Their natural\\ndiffidence and caution fall from them like a glove. Tommy\\nrealized perfectly that in his own wits lay the only chance of\\nescape, and behind his casual manner he was racking his brains\\nfuriously.\\nThe cold accents of the German took up the conversation:\\n\"Have you anything to say before you are put to death as a spy?\"\\n\"Simply lots of things,\" replied Tommy with the same urbanity as\\nbefore.\\n\"Do you deny that you were listening at that door?\"\\n\"I do not. I must really apologize--but your conversation was so\\ninteresting that it overcame my scruples.\"\\n\"How did you get in?\"\\n\"Dear old Conrad here.\" Tommy smiled deprecatingly at him. \"I\\nhesitate to suggest pensioning off a faithful servant, but you\\nreally ought to have a better watchdog.\"\\nConrad snarled impotently, and said sullenly, as the man with the\\nbeard swung round upon him:\\n\"He gave the word. How was I to know?\"\\n\"Yes,\" Tommy chimed in. \"How was he to know? Don\\'t blame the\\npoor fellow. His hasty action has given me the pleasure of seeing\\nyou all face to face.\"\\nHe fancied that his words caused some discomposure among the\\ngroup, but the watchful German stilled it with a wave of his\\nhand.\\n\"Dead men tell no tales,\" he said evenly.\\n\"Ah,\" said Tommy, \"but I\\'m not dead yet!\"\\n\"You soon will be, my young friend,\" said the German.\\nAn assenting murmur came from the others.\\nTommy\\'s heart beat faster, but his casual pleasantness did not\\nwaver.\\n\"I think not,\" he said firmly. \"I should have a great objection\\nto dying.\"\\nHe had got them puzzled, he saw that by the look on his captor\\'s\\nface.\\n\"Can you give us any reason why we should not put you to death?\"\\nasked the German.\\n\"Several,\" replied Tommy. \"Look here, you\\'ve been asking me a\\nlot of questions. Let me ask you one for a change. Why didn\\'t\\nyou kill me off at once before I regained consciousness?\"\\nThe German hesitated, and Tommy seized his advantage.\\n\"Because you didn\\'t know how much I knew--and where I obtained\\nthat knowledge. If you kill me now, you never will know.\"\\nBut here the emotions of Boris became too much for him. He\\nstepped forward waving his arms.\\n\"You hell-hound of a spy,\" he screamed. \"We will give you short\\nshrift. Kill him! Kill him!\"\\nThere was a roar of applause.\\n\"You hear?\" said the German, his eyes on Tommy. \"What have you\\nto say to that?\"\\n\"Say?\" Tommy shrugged his shoulders. \"Pack of fools. Let them\\nask themselves a few questions. How did I get into this place?\\nRemember what dear old Conrad said--WITH YOUR OWN PASSWORD,\\nwasn\\'t it? How did I get hold of that? You don\\'t suppose I came\\nup those steps haphazard and said the first thing that came into\\nmy head?\"\\nTommy was pleased with the concluding words of this speech. His\\nonly regret was that Tuppence was not present to appreciate its\\nfull flavour.\\n\"That is true,\" said the working man suddenly. \"Comrades, we\\nhave been betrayed!\"\\nAn ugly murmur arose. Tommy smiled at them encouragingly.\\n\"That\\'s better. How can you hope to make a success of any job if\\nyou don\\'t use your brains?\"\\n\"You will tell us who has betrayed us,\" said the German. \"But\\nthat shall not save you--oh, no! You shall tell us all that you\\nknow. Boris, here, knows pretty ways of making people speak!\"\\n\"Bah!\" said Tommy scornfully, fighting down a singularly\\nunpleasant feeling in the pit of his stomach. \"You will neither\\ntorture me nor kill me.\"\\n\"And why not?\" asked Boris.\\n\"Because you\\'d kill the goose that lays the golden eggs,\" replied\\nTommy quietly.\\nThere was a momentary pause. It seemed as though Tommy\\'s\\npersistent assurance was at last conquering. They were no longer\\ncompletely sure of themselves. The man in the shabby clothes\\nstared at Tommy searchingly.\\n\"He\\'s bluffing you, Boris,\" he said quietly.\\nTommy hated him. Had the man seen through him?\\nThe German, with an effort, turned roughly to Tommy.\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\"What do you think I mean?\" parried Tommy, searching desperately\\nin his own mind.\\nSuddenly Boris stepped forward, and shook his fist in Tommy\\'s\\nface.\\n\"Speak, you swine of an Englishman--speak!\"\\n\"Don\\'t get so excited, my good fellow,\" said Tommy calmly.\\n\"That\\'s the worst of you foreigners. You can\\'t keep calm. Now, I\\nask you, do I look as though I thought there were the least\\nchance of your killing me?\"\\nHe looked confidently round, and was glad they could not hear the\\npersistent beating of his heart which gave the lie to his words.\\n\"No,\" admitted Boris at last sullenly, \"you do not.\"\\n\"Thank God, he\\'s not a mind reader,\" thought Tommy. Aloud he\\npursued his advantage:\\n\"And why am I so confident? Because I know something that puts\\nme in a position to propose a bargain.\"\\n\"A bargain?\" The bearded man took him up sharply.\\n\"Yes--a bargain. My life and liberty against----\" He paused.\\n\"Against what?\"\\nThe group pressed forward. You could have heard a pin drop.\\nSlowly Tommy spoke.\\n\"The papers that Danvers brought over from America in the\\nLusitania.\"\\nThe effect of his words was electrical. Every one was on his\\nfeet. The German waved them back. He leaned over Tommy, his face\\npurple with excitement.\\n\"Himmel! You have got them, then?\"\\nWith magnificent calm Tommy shook his head.\\n\"You know where they are?\" persisted the German.\\nAgain Tommy shook his head. \"Not in the least.\"\\n\"Then--then----\" angry and baffled, the words failed him.\\nTommy looked round. He saw anger and bewilderment on every face,\\nbut his calm assurance had done its work--no one doubted but that\\nsomething lay behind his words.\\n\"I don\\'t know where the papers are--but I believe that I can find\\nthem. I have a theory----\"\\n\"Pah!\"\\nTommy raised his hand, and silenced the clamours of disgust.\\n\"I call it a theory--but I\\'m pretty sure of my facts--facts that\\nare known to no one but myself. In any case what do you lose? If\\nI can produce the papers--you give me my life and liberty in\\nexchange. Is it a bargain?\"\\n\"And if we refuse?\" said the German quietly.\\nTommy lay back on the couch.\\n\"The 29th,\" he said thoughtfully, \"is less than a fortnight\\nahead----\"\\nFor a moment the German hesitated. Then he made a sign to\\nConrad.\\n\"Take him into the other room.\"\\nFor five minutes, Tommy sat on the bed in the dingy room next\\ndoor. His heart was beating violently. He had risked all on this\\nthrow. How would they decide? And all the while that this\\nagonized questioning went on within him, he talked flippantly to\\nConrad, enraging the cross-grained doorkeeper to the point of\\nhomicidal mania.\\nAt last the door opened, and the German called imperiously to\\nConrad to return.\\n\"Let\\'s hope the judge hasn\\'t put his black cap on,\" remarked\\nTommy frivolously. \"That\\'s right, Conrad, march me in. The\\nprisoner is at the bar, gentlemen.\"\\nThe German was seated once more behind the table. He motioned to\\nTommy to sit down opposite to him.\\n\"We accept,\" he said harshly, \"on terms. The papers must be\\ndelivered to us before you go free.\"\\n\"Idiot!\" said Tommy amiably. \"How do you think I can look for\\nthem if you keep me tied by the leg here?\"\\n\"What do you expect, then?\"\\n\"I must have liberty to go about the business in my own way.\"\\nThe German laughed.\\n\"Do you think we are little children to let you walk out of here\\nleaving us a pretty story full of promises?\"\\n\"No,\" said Tommy thoughtfully. \"Though infinitely simpler for\\nme, I did not really think you would agree to that plan. Very\\nwell, we must arrange a compromise. How would it be if you\\nattached little Conrad here to my person. He\\'s a faithful fellow,\\nand very ready with the fist.\"\\n\"We prefer,\" said the German coldly, \"that you should remain\\nhere. One of our number will carry out your instructions\\nminutely. If the operations are complicated, he will return to\\nyou with a report and you can instruct him further.\"\\n\"You\\'re tying my hands,\" complained Tommy. \"It\\'s a very delicate\\naffair, and the other fellow will muff it up as likely as not,\\nand then where shall I be? I don\\'t believe one of you has got an\\nounce of tact.\"\\nThe German rapped the table.\\n\"Those are our terms. Otherwise, death!\"\\nTommy leaned back wearily.\\n\"I like your style. Curt, but attractive. So be it, then. But\\none thing is essential, I must see the girl.\"\\n\"What girl?\"\\n\"Jane Finn, of course.\"\\nThe other looked at him curiously for some minutes, then he said\\nslowly, and as though choosing his words with care:\\n\"Do you not know that she can tell you nothing?\"\\nTommy\\'s heart beat a little faster. Would he succeed in coming\\nface to face with the girl he was seeking?\\n\"I shall not ask her to tell me anything,\" he said quietly. \"Not\\nin so many words, that is.\"\\n\"Then why see her?\"\\nTommy paused.\\n\"To watch her face when I ask her one question,\" he replied at\\nlast.\\nAgain there was a look in the German\\'s eyes that Tommy did not\\nquite understand.\\n\"She will not be able to answer your question.\"\\n\"That does not matter. I shall have seen her face when I ask it.\"\\n\"And you think that will tell you anything?\" He gave a short\\ndisagreeable laugh. More than ever, Tommy felt that there was a\\nfactor somewhere that he did not understand. The German looked at\\nhim searchingly. \"I wonder whether, after all, you know as much\\nas we think?\" he said softly.\\nTommy felt his ascendancy less sure than a moment before. His\\nhold had slipped a little. But he was puzzled. What had he said\\nwrong? He spoke out on the impulse of the moment.\\n\"There may be things that you know which I do not. I have not\\npretended to be aware of all the details of your show. But\\nequally I\\'ve got something up my sleeve that you don\\'t know\\nabout. And that\\'s where I mean to score. Danvers was a damned\\nclever fellow----\" He broke off as if he had said too much.\\nBut the German\\'s face had lightened a little.\\n\"Danvers,\" he murmured. \"I see----\" He paused a minute, then\\nwaved to Conrad. \"Take him away. Upstairs--you know.\"\\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Tommy. \"What about the girl?\"\\n\"That may perhaps be arranged.\"\\n\"It must be.\"\\n\"We will see about it. Only one person can decide that.\"\\n\"Who?\" asked Tommy. But he knew the answer.\\n\"Mr. Brown----\"\\n\"Shall I see him?\"\\n\"Perhaps.\"\\n\"Come,\" said Conrad harshly.\\nTommy rose obediently. Outside the door his gaoler motioned to\\nhim to mount the stairs. He himself followed close behind. On\\nthe floor above Conrad opened a door and Tommy passed into a\\nsmall room. Conrad lit a hissing gas burner and went out. Tommy\\nheard the sound of the key being turned in the lock.\\nHe set to work to examine his prison. It was a smaller room than\\nthe one downstairs, and there was something peculiarly airless\\nabout the atmosphere of it. Then he realized that there was no\\nwindow. He walked round it. The walls were filthily dirty, as\\neverywhere else. Four pictures hung crookedly on the wall\\nrepresenting scenes from Faust. Marguerite with her box of\\njewels, the church scene, Siebel and his flowers, and Faust and\\nMephistopheles. The latter brought Tommy\\'s mind back to Mr.\\nBrown again. In this sealed and closed chamber, with its\\nclose-fitting heavy door, he felt cut off from the world, and the\\nsinister power of the arch-criminal seemed more real. Shout as\\nhe would, no one could ever hear him. The place was a living\\ntomb....\\nWith an effort Tommy pulled himself together. He sank on to the\\nbed and gave himself up to reflection. His head ached badly;\\nalso, he was hungry. The silence of the place was dispiriting.\\n\"Anyway,\" said Tommy, trying to cheer himself, \"I shall see the\\nchief--the mysterious Mr. Brown and with a bit of luck in\\nbluffing I shall see the mysterious Jane Finn also. After\\nthat----\"\\nAfter that Tommy was forced to admit the prospect looked dreary.\\nCHAPTER XVII\\nANNETTE\\nTHE troubles of the future, however, soon faded before the\\ntroubles of the present. And of these, the most immediate and\\npressing was that of hunger. Tommy had a healthy and vigorous\\nappetite. The steak and chips partaken of for lunch seemed now to\\nbelong to another decade. He regretfully recognized the fact\\nthat he would not make a success of a hunger strike.\\nHe prowled aimlessly about his prison. Once or twice he\\ndiscarded dignity, and pounded on the door. But nobody answered\\nthe summons.\\n\"Hang it all!\" said Tommy indignantly. \"They can\\'t mean to\\nstarve me to death.\" A new-born fear passed through his mind\\nthat this might, perhaps, be one of those \"pretty ways\" of making\\na prisoner speak, which had been attributed to Boris. But on\\nreflection he dismissed the idea.\\n\"It\\'s that sour faced brute Conrad,\" he decided. \"That\\'s a\\nfellow I shall enjoy getting even with one of these days. This is\\njust a bit of spite on his part. I\\'m certain of it.\"\\nFurther meditations induced in him the feeling that it would be\\nextremely pleasant to bring something down with a whack on\\nConrad\\'s egg-shaped head. Tommy stroked his own head tenderly,\\nand gave himself up to the pleasures of imagination. Finally a\\nbright idea flashed across his brain. Why not convert imagination\\ninto reality? Conrad was undoubtedly the tenant of the house.\\nThe others, with the possible exception of the bearded German,\\nmerely used it as a rendezvous. Therefore, why not wait in\\nambush for Conrad behind the door, and when he entered bring down\\na chair, or one of the decrepit pictures, smartly on to his head.\\nOne would, of course, be careful not to hit too hard. And\\nthen--and then, simply walk out! If he met anyone on the way\\ndown, well----Tommy brightened at the thought of an encounter\\nwith his fists. Such an affair was infinitely more in his line\\nthan the verbal encounter of this afternoon. Intoxicated by his\\nplan, Tommy gently unhooked the picture of the Devil and Faust,\\nand settled himself in position. His hopes were high. The plan\\nseemed to him simple but excellent.\\nTime went on, but Conrad did not appear. Night and day were the\\nsame in this prison room, but Tommy\\'s wrist-watch, which enjoyed\\na certain degree of accuracy, informed him that it was nine\\no\\'clock in the evening. Tommy reflected gloomily that if supper\\ndid not arrive soon it would be a question of waiting for\\nbreakfast. At ten o\\'clock hope deserted him, and he flung\\nhimself on the bed to seek consolation in sleep. In five minutes\\nhis woes were forgotten.\\nThe sound of the key turning in the lock awoke him from his\\nslumbers. Not belonging to the type of hero who is famous for\\nawaking in full possession of his faculties, Tommy merely blinked\\nat the ceiling and wondered vaguely where he was. Then he\\nremembered, and looked at his watch. It was eight o\\'clock.\\n\"It\\'s either early morning tea or breakfast,\" deduced the young\\nman, \"and pray God it\\'s the latter!\"\\nThe door swung open. Too late, Tommy remembered his scheme of\\nobliterating the unprepossessing Conrad. A moment later he was\\nglad that he had, for it was not Conrad who entered, but a girl.\\nShe carried a tray which she set down on the table.\\nIn the feeble light of the gas burner Tommy blinked at her. He\\ndecided at once that she was one of the most beautiful girls he\\nhad ever seen. Her hair was a full rich brown, with sudden glints\\nof gold in it as though there were imprisoned sunbeams struggling\\nin its depths. There was a wild-rose quality about her face. Her\\neyes, set wide apart, were hazel, a golden hazel that again\\nrecalled a memory of sunbeams.\\nA delirious thought shot through Tommy\\'s mind.\\n\"Are you Jane Finn?\" he asked breathlessly.\\nThe girl shook her head wonderingly.\\n\"My name is Annette, monsieur.\"\\nShe spoke in a soft, broken English.\\n\"Oh!\" said Tommy, rather taken aback. \"Francaise?\" he hazarded.\\n\"Oui, monsieur. Monsieur parle francais?\"\\n\"Not for any length of time,\" said Tommy. \"What\\'s that?\\nBreakfast?\"\\nThe girl nodded. Tommy dropped off the bed and came and\\ninspected the contents of the tray. It consisted of a loaf, some\\nmargarine, and a jug of coffee.\\n\"The living is not equal to the Ritz,\" he observed with a sigh.\\n\"But for what we are at last about to receive the Lord has made\\nme truly thankful. Amen.\"\\nHe drew up a chair, and the girl turned away to the door.\\n\"Wait a sec,\" cried Tommy. \"There are lots of things I want to\\nask you, Annette. What are you doing in this house? Don\\'t tell\\nme you\\'re Conrad\\'s niece, or daughter, or anything, because I\\ncan\\'t believe it.\"\\n\"I do the SERVICE, monsieur. I am not related to anybody.\"\\n\"I see,\" said Tommy. \"You know what I asked you just now. Have\\nyou ever heard that name?\"\\n\"I have heard people speak of Jane Finn, I think.\"\\n\"You don\\'t know where she is?\"\\nAnnette shook her head.\\n\"She\\'s not in this house, for instance?\"\\n\"Oh no, monsieur. I must go now--they will be waiting for me.\"\\nShe hurried out. The key turned in the lock.\\n\"I wonder who \\'they\\' are,\" mused Tommy, as he continued to make\\ninroads on the loaf. \"With a bit of luck, that girl might help\\nme to get out of here. She doesn\\'t look like one of the gang.\"\\nAt one o\\'clock Annette reappeared with another tray, but this\\ntime Conrad accompanied her.\\n\"Good morning,\" said Tommy amiably. \"You have NOT used Pear\\'s\\nsoap, I see.\"\\nConrad growled threateningly.\\n\"No light repartee, have you, old bean? There, there, we can\\'t\\nalways have brains as well as beauty. What have we for lunch?\\nStew? How did I know? Elementary, my dear Watson--the smell of\\nonions is unmistakable.\"\\n\"Talk away,\" grunted the man. \"It\\'s little enough time you\\'ll\\nhave to talk in, maybe.\"\\nThe remark was unpleasant in its suggestion, but Tommy ignored\\nit. He sat down at the table.\\n\"Retire, varlet,\" he said, with a wave of his hand. \"Prate not to\\nthy betters.\"\\nThat evening Tommy sat on the bed, and cogitated deeply. Would\\nConrad again accompany the girl? If he did not, should he risk\\ntrying to make an ally of her? He decided that he must leave no\\nstone unturned. His position was desperate.\\nAt eight o\\'clock the familiar sound of the key turning made him\\nspring to his feet. The girl was alone.\\n\"Shut the door,\" he commanded. \"I want to speak to you.\" She\\nobeyed.\\n\"Look here, Annette, I want you to help me get out of this.\" She\\nshook her head.\\n\"Impossible. There are three of them on the floor below.\"\\n\"Oh!\" Tommy was secretly grateful for the information. \"But you\\nwould help me if you could?\"\\n\"No, monsieur.\"\\n\"Why not?\"\\nThe girl hesitated.\\n\"I think--they are my own people. You have spied upon them. They\\nare quite right to keep you here.\"\\n\"They\\'re a bad lot, Annette. If you\\'ll help me, I\\'ll take you\\naway from the lot of them. And you\\'d probably get a good whack\\nof money.\"\\nBut the girl merely shook her head.\\n\"I dare not, monsieur; I am afraid of them.\"\\nShe turned away.\\n\"Wouldn\\'t you do anything to help another girl?\" cried Tommy.\\n\"She\\'s about your age too. Won\\'t you save her from their\\nclutches?\"\\n\"You mean Jane Finn?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"It is her you came here to look for? Yes?\"\\n\"That\\'s it.\"\\nThe girl looked at him, then passed her hand across her forehead.\\n\"Jane Finn. Always I hear that name. It is familiar.\"\\nTommy came forward eagerly.\\n\"You must know SOMETHING about her?\"\\nBut the girl turned away abruptly.\\n\"I know nothing--only the name.\" She walked towards the door.\\nSuddenly she uttered a cry. Tommy stared. She had caught sight\\nof the picture he had laid against the wall the night before. For\\na moment he caught a look of terror in her eyes. As inexplicably\\nit changed to relief. Then abruptly she went out of the room.\\nTommy could make nothing of it. Did she fancy that he had meant\\nto attack her with it? Surely not. He rehung the picture on the\\nwall thoughtfully.\\nThree more days went by in dreary inaction. Tommy felt the\\nstrain telling on his nerves. He saw no one but Conrad and\\nAnnette, and the girl had become dumb. She spoke only in\\nmonosyllables. A kind of dark suspicion smouldered in her eyes.\\nTommy felt that if this solitary confinement went on much longer\\nhe would go mad. He gathered from Conrad that they were waiting\\nfor orders from \"Mr. Brown.\" Perhaps, thought Tommy, he was\\nabroad or away, and they were obliged to wait for his return.\\nBut the evening of the third day brought a rude awakening.\\nIt was barely seven o\\'clock when he heard the tramp of footsteps\\noutside in the passage. In another minute the door was flung\\nopen. Conrad entered. With him was the evil-looking Number 14.\\nTommy\\'s heart sank at the sight of them.\\n\"Evenin\\', gov\\'nor,\" said the man with a leer. \"Got those ropes,\\nmate?\"\\nThe silent Conrad produced a length of fine cord. The next\\nminute Number 14\\'s hands, horribly dexterous, were winding the\\ncord round his limbs, while Conrad held him down.\\n\"What the devil----?\" began Tommy.\\nBut the slow, speechless grin of the silent Conrad froze the\\nwords on his lips.\\nNumber 14 proceeded deftly with his task. In another minute\\nTommy was a mere helpless bundle. Then at last Conrad spoke:\\n\"Thought you\\'d bluffed us, did you? With what you knew, and what\\nyou didn\\'t know. Bargained with us! And all the time it was\\nbluff! Bluff! You know less than a kitten. But your number\\'s up\\nnow all right, you b----swine.\"\\nTommy lay silent. There was nothing to say. He had failed.\\nSomehow or other the omnipotent Mr. Brown had seen through his\\npretensions. Suddenly a thought occurred to him.\\n\"A very good speech, Conrad,\" he said approvingly. \"But wherefore\\nthe bonds and fetters? Why not let this kind gentleman here cut\\nmy throat without delay?\"\\n\"Garn,\" said Number 14 unexpectedly. \"Think we\\'re as green as to\\ndo you in here, and have the police nosing round? Not \\'alf!\\nWe\\'ve ordered the carriage for your lordship to-morrow mornin\\',\\nbut in the meantime we\\'re not taking any chances, see!\"\\n\"Nothing,\" said Tommy, \"could be plainer than your words--unless\\nit was your face.\"\\n\"Stow it,\" said Number 14.\\n\"With pleasure,\" replied Tommy. \"You\\'re making a sad\\nmistake--but yours will be the loss.\"\\n\"You don\\'t kid us that way again,\" said Number 14. \"Talking as\\nthough you were still at the blooming Ritz, aren\\'t you?\"\\nTommy made no reply. He was engaged in wondering how Mr. Brown\\nhad discovered his identity. He decided that Tuppence, in the\\nthroes of anxiety, had gone to the police, and that his\\ndisappearance having been made public the gang had not been slow\\nto put two and two together.\\nThe two men departed and the door slammed. Tommy was left to his\\nmeditations. They were not pleasant ones. Already his limbs felt\\ncramped and stiff. He was utterly helpless, and he could see no\\nhope anywhere.\\nAbout an hour had passed when he heard the key softly turned, and\\nthe door opened. It was Annette. Tommy\\'s heart beat a little\\nfaster. He had forgotten the girl. Was it possible that she had\\ncome to his help?\\nSuddenly he heard Conrad\\'s voice:\\n\"Come out of it, Annette. He doesn\\'t want any supper to-night.\"\\n\"Oui, oui, je sais bien. But I must take the other tray. We need\\nthe things on it.\"\\n\"Well, hurry up,\" growled Conrad.\\nWithout looking at Tommy the girl went over to the table, and\\npicked up the tray. She raised a hand and turned out the light.\\n\"Curse you\"--Conrad had come to the door--\"why did you do that?\"\\n\"I always turn it out. You should have told me. Shall I relight\\nit, Monsieur Conrad?\"\\n\"No, come on out of it.\"\\n\"Le beau petit monsieur,\" cried Annette, pausing by the bed in\\nthe darkness. \"You have tied him up well, hein? He is like a\\ntrussed chicken!\" The frank amusement in her tone jarred on the\\nboy; but at that moment, to his amazement, he felt her hand\\nrunning lightly over his bonds, and something small and cold was\\npressed into the palm of his hand.\\n\"Come on, Annette.\"\\n\"Mais me voila.\"\\nThe door shut. Tommy heard Conrad say:\\n\"Lock it and give me the key.\"\\nThe footsteps died away. Tommy lay petrified with amazement. The\\nobject Annette had thrust into his hand was a small penknife, the\\nblade open. From the way she had studiously avoided looking at\\nhim, and her action with the light, he came to the conclusion\\nthat the room was overlooked. There must be a peep-hole somewhere\\nin the walls. Remembering how guarded she had always been in her\\nmanner, he saw that he had probably been under observation all\\nthe time. Had he said anything to give himself away? Hardly. He\\nhad revealed a wish to escape and a desire to find Jane Finn, but\\nnothing that could have given a clue to his own identity. True,\\nhis question to Annette had proved that he was personally\\nunacquainted with Jane Finn, but he had never pretended\\notherwise. The question now was, did Annette really know more?\\nWere her denials intended primarily for the listeners? On that\\npoint he could come to no conclusion.\\nBut there was a more vital question that drove out all others.\\nCould he, bound as he was, manage to cut his bonds? He essayed\\ncautiously to rub the open blade up and down on the cord that\\nbound his two wrists together. It was an awkward business, and\\ndrew a smothered \"Ow\" of pain from him as the knife cut into his\\nwrist. But slowly and doggedly he went on sawing to and fro. He\\ncut the flesh badly, but at last he felt the cord slacken. With\\nhis hands free, the rest was easy. Five minutes later he stood\\nupright with some difficulty, owing to the cramp in his limbs.\\nHis first care was to bind up his bleeding wrist. Then he sat on\\nthe edge of the bed to think. Conrad had taken the key of the\\ndoor, so he could expect little more assistance from Annette.\\nThe only outlet from the room was the door, consequently he would\\nperforce have to wait until the two men returned to fetch him.\\nBut when they did . . . Tommy smiled! Moving with infinite\\ncaution in the dark room, he found and unhooked the famous\\npicture. He felt an economical pleasure that his first plan would\\nnot be wasted. There was now nothing to do but to wait. He\\nwaited.\\nThe night passed slowly. Tommy lived through an eternity of\\nhours, but at last he heard footsteps. He stood upright, drew a\\ndeep breath, and clutched the picture firmly.\\nThe door opened. A faint light streamed in from outside. Conrad\\nwent straight towards the gas to light it. Tommy deeply regretted\\nthat it was he who had entered first. It would have been pleasant\\nto get even with Conrad. Number 14 followed. As he stepped\\nacross the threshold, Tommy brought the picture down with\\nterrific force on his head. Number 14 went down amidst a\\nstupendous crash of broken glass. In a minute Tommy had slipped\\nout and pulled to the door. The key was in the lock. He turned\\nit and withdrew it just as Conrad hurled himself against the door\\nfrom the inside with a volley of curses.\\nFor a moment Tommy hesitated. There was the sound of some one\\nstirring on the floor below. Then the German\\'s voice came up the\\nstairs.\\n\"Gott im Himmel! Conrad, what is it?\"\\nTommy felt a small hand thrust into his. Beside him stood\\nAnnette. She pointed up a rickety ladder that apparently led to\\nsome attics.\\n\"Quick--up here!\" She dragged him after her up the ladder. In\\nanother moment they were standing in a dusty garret littered with\\nlumber. Tommy looked round.\\n\"This won\\'t do. It\\'s a regular trap. There\\'s no way out.\"\\n\"Hush! Wait.\" The girl put her finger to her lips. She crept to\\nthe top of the ladder and listened.\\nThe banging and beating on the door was terrific. The German and\\nanother were trying to force the door in. Annette explained in a\\nwhisper:\\n\"They will think you are still inside. They cannot hear what\\nConrad says. The door is too thick.\"\\n\"I thought you could hear what went on in the room?\"\\n\"There is a peep-hole into the next room. It was clever of you\\nto guess. But they will not think of that--they are only anxious\\nto get in.\"\\n\"Yes--but look here----\"\\n\"Leave it to me.\" She bent down. To his amazement, Tommy saw\\nthat she was fastening the end of a long piece of string to the\\nhandle of a big cracked jug. She arranged it carefully, then\\nturned to Tommy.\\n\"Have you the key of the door?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Give it to me.\"\\nHe handed it to her.\\n\"I am going down. Do you think you can go halfway, and then\\nswing yourself down BEHIND the ladder, so that they will not see\\nyou?\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"There\\'s a big cupboard in the shadow of the landing. Stand\\nbehind it. Take the end of this string in your hand. When I\\'ve\\nlet the others out--PULL!\"\\nBefore he had time to ask her anything more, she had flitted\\nlightly down the ladder and was in the midst of the group with a\\nloud cry:\\n\"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Qu\\'est-ce qu\\'il y a?\"\\nThe German turned on her with an oath.\\n\"Get out of this. Go to your room!\"\\nVery cautiously Tommy swung himself down the back of the ladder.\\nSo long as they did not turn round ... all was well. He crouched\\nbehind the cupboard. They were still between him and the stairs.\\n\"AH!\" Annette appeared to stumble over something. She stooped.\\n\"Mon Dieu, voila la clef!\"\\nThe German snatched it from her. He unlocked the door. Conrad\\nstumbled out, swearing.\\n\"Where is he? Have you got him?\"\\n\"We have seen no one,\" said the German sharply. His face paled.\\n\"Who do you mean?\"\\nConrad gave vent to another oath.\\n\"He\\'s got away.\"\\n\"Impossible. He would have passed us.\"\\nAt that moment, with an ecstatic smile Tommy pulled the string. A\\ncrash of crockery came from the attic above. In a trice the men\\nwere pushing each other up the rickety ladder and had disappeared\\ninto the darkness above.\\nQuick as a flash Tommy leapt from his hiding-place and dashed\\ndown the stairs, pulling the girl with him. There was no one in\\nthe hall. He fumbled over the bolts and chain. At last they\\nyielded, the door swung open. He turned. Annette had\\ndisappeared.\\nTommy stood spell-bound. Had she run upstairs again? What\\nmadness possessed her! He fumed with impatience, but he stood\\nhis ground. He would not go without her.\\nAnd suddenly there was an outcry overhead, an exclamation from\\nthe German, and then Annette\\'s voice, clear and high:\\n\"Ma foi, he has escaped! And quickly! Who would have thought\\nit?\"\\nTommy still stood rooted to the ground. Was that a command to\\nhim to go? He fancied it was.\\nAnd then, louder still, the words floated down to him:\\n\"This is a terrible house. I want to go back to Marguerite. To\\nMarguerite. TO MARGUERITE!\"\\nTommy had run back to the stairs. She wanted him to go and leave\\nher. But why? At all costs he must try and get her away with\\nhim. Then his heart sank. Conrad was leaping down the stairs,\\nuttering a savage cry at the sight of him. After him came the\\nothers.\\nTommy stopped Conrad\\'s rush with a straight blow with his fist.\\nIt caught the other on the point of the jaw and he fell like a\\nlog. The second man tripped over his body and fell. From higher\\nup the staircase there was a flash, and a bullet grazed Tommy\\'s\\near. He realized that it would be good for his health to get out\\nof this house as soon as possible. As regards Annette he could\\ndo nothing. He had got even with Conrad, which was one\\nsatisfaction. The blow had been a good one.\\nHe leapt for the door, slamming it behind him. The square was\\ndeserted. In front of the house was a baker\\'s van. Evidently he\\nwas to have been taken out of London in that, and his body found\\nmany miles from the house in Soho. The driver jumped to the\\npavement and tried to bar Tommy\\'s way. Again Tommy\\'s fist shot\\nout, and the driver sprawled on the pavement.\\nTommy took to his heels and ran--none too soon. The front door\\nopened and a hail of bullets followed him. Fortunately none of\\nthem hit him. He turned the corner of the square.\\n\"There\\'s one thing,\" he thought to himself, \"they can\\'t go on\\nshooting. They\\'ll have the police after them if they do. I\\nwonder they dared to there.\"\\nHe heard the footsteps of his pursuers behind him, and redoubled\\nhis own pace. Once he got out of these by-ways he would be safe.\\nThere would be a policeman about somewhere--not that he really\\nwanted to invoke the aid of the police if he could possibly do\\nwithout it. It meant explanations, and general awkwardness. In\\nanother moment he had reason to bless his luck. He stumbled over\\na prostrate figure, which started up with a yell of alarm and\\ndashed off down the street. Tommy drew back into a doorway. In a\\nminute he had the pleasure of seeing his two pursuers, of whom\\nthe German was one, industriously tracking down the red herring!\\nTommy sat down quietly on the doorstep and allowed a few moments\\nto elapse while he recovered his breath. Then he strolled gently\\nin the opposite direction. He glanced at his watch. It was a\\nlittle after half-past five. It was rapidly growing light. At\\nthe next corner he passed a policeman. The policeman cast a\\nsuspicious eye on him. Tommy felt slightly offended. Then,\\npassing his hand over his face, he laughed. He had not shaved or\\nwashed for three days! What a guy he must look.\\nHe betook himself without more ado to a Turkish Bath\\nestablishment which he knew to be open all night. He emerged into\\nthe busy daylight feeling himself once more, and able to make\\nplans.\\nFirst of all, he must have a square meal. He had eaten nothing\\nsince midday yesterday. He turned into an A.B.C. shop and\\nordered eggs and bacon and coffee. Whilst he ate, he read a\\nmorning paper propped up in front of him. Suddenly he stiffened.\\nThere was a long article on Kramenin, who was described as the\\n\"man behind Bolshevism\" in Russia, and who had just arrived in\\nLondon--some thought as an unofficial envoy. His career was\\nsketched lightly, and it was firmly asserted that he, and not the\\nfigurehead leaders, had been the author of the Russian\\nRevolution.\\nIn the centre of the page was his portrait.\\n\"So that\\'s who Number 1 is,\" said Tommy with his mouth full of\\neggs and bacon. \"Not a doubt about it, I must push on.\"\\nHe paid for his breakfast, and betook himself to Whitehall. There\\nhe sent up his name, and the message that it was urgent. A few\\nminutes later he was in the presence of the man who did not here\\ngo by the name of \"Mr. Carter.\" There was a frown on his face.\\n\"Look here, you\\'ve no business to come asking for me in this way.\\nI thought that was distinctly understood?\"\\n\"It was, sir. But I judged it important to lose no time.\"\\nAnd as briefly and succinctly as possible he detailed the\\nexperiences of the last few days.\\nHalf-way through, Mr. Carter interrupted him to give a few\\ncryptic orders through the telephone. All traces of displeasure\\nhad now left his face. He nodded energetically when Tommy had\\nfinished.\\n\"Quite right. Every moment\\'s of value. Fear we shall be too\\nlate anyway. They wouldn\\'t wait. Would clear out at once.\\nStill, they may have left something behind them that will be a\\nclue. You say you\\'ve recognized Number 1 to be Kramenin? That\\'s\\nimportant. We want something against him badly to prevent the\\nCabinet falling on his neck too freely. What about the others?\\nYou say two faces were familiar to you? One\\'s a Labour man, you\\nthink? Just look through these photos, and see if you can spot\\nhim.\"\\nA minute later, Tommy held one up. Mr. Carter exhibited some\\nsurprise.\\n\"Ah, Westway! Shouldn\\'t have thought it. Poses as being\\nmoderate. As for the other fellow, I think I can give a good\\nguess.\" He handed another photograph to Tommy, and smiled at the\\nother\\'s exclamation. \"I\\'m right, then. Who is he? Irishman.\\nProminent Unionist M.P. All a blind, of course. We\\'ve suspected\\nit--but couldn\\'t get any proof. Yes, you\\'ve done very well, young\\nman. The 29th, you say, is the date. That gives us very little\\ntime--very little time indeed.\"\\n\"But----\" Tommy hesitated.\\nMr. Carter read his thoughts.\\n\"We can deal with the General Strike menace, I think. It\\'s a\\ntoss-up--but we\\'ve got a sporting chance! But if that draft\\ntreaty turns up--we\\'re done. England will be plunged in anarchy.\\nAh, what\\'s that? The car? Come on, Beresford, we\\'ll go and have\\na look at this house of yours.\"\\nTwo constables were on duty in front of the house in Soho. An\\ninspector reported to Mr. Carter in a low voice. The latter\\nturned to Tommy.\\n\"The birds have flown--as we thought. We might as well go over\\nit.\"\\nGoing over the deserted house seemed to Tommy to partake of the\\ncharacter of a dream. Everything was just as it had been. The\\nprison room with the crooked pictures, the broken jug in the\\nattic, the meeting room with its long table. But nowhere was\\nthere a trace of papers. Everything of that kind had either been\\ndestroyed or taken away. And there was no sign of Annette.\\n\"What you tell me about the girl puzzled me,\" said Mr. Carter.\\n\"You believe that she deliberately went back?\"\\n\"It would seem so, sir. She ran upstairs while I was getting.\\nthe door open.\"\\n\"H\\'m, she must belong to the gang, then; but, being a woman,\\ndidn\\'t feel like standing by to see a personable young man\\nkilled. But evidently she\\'s in with them, or she wouldn\\'t have\\ngone back.\"\\n\"I can\\'t believe she\\'s really one of them, sir. She--seemed so\\ndifferent----\"\\n\"Good-looking, I suppose?\" said Mr. Carter with a smile that made\\nTommy flush to the roots of his hair. He admitted Annette\\'s\\nbeauty rather shamefacedly.\\n\"By the way,\" observed Mr. Carter, \"have you shown yourself to\\nMiss Tuppence yet? She\\'s been bombarding me with letters about\\nyou.\"\\n\"Tuppence? I was afraid she might get a bit rattled. Did she go\\nto the police?\"\\nMr. Carter shook his head.\\n\"Then I wonder how they twigged me.\"\\nMr. Carter looked inquiringly at him, and Tommy explained. The\\nother nodded thoughtfully.\\n\"True, that\\'s rather a curious point. Unless the mention of the\\nRitz was an accidental remark?\"\\n\"It might have been, sir. But they must have found out about me\\nsuddenly in some way.\"\\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Carter, looking round him, \"there\\'s nothing more\\nto be done here. What about some lunch with me?\"\\n\"Thanks awfully, sir. But I think I\\'d better get back and rout\\nout Tuppence.\"\\n\"Of course. Give her my kind regards and tell her not to believe\\nyou\\'re killed too readily next time.\"\\nTommy grinned.\\n\"I take a lot of killing, sir.\"\\n\"So I perceive,\" said Mr. Carter dryly. \"Well, good-bye.\\nRemember you\\'re a marked man now, and take reasonable care of\\nyourself.\"\\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\\nHailing a taxi briskly Tommy stepped in, and was swiftly borne to\\nthe Ritz\\' dwelling the while on the pleasurable anticipation of\\nstartling Tuppence.\\n\"Wonder what she\\'s been up to. Dogging \\'Rita\\' most likely. By\\nthe way, I suppose that\\'s who Annette meant by Marguerite. I\\ndidn\\'t get it at the time.\" The thought saddened him a little,\\nfor it seemed to prove that Mrs. Vandemeyer and the girl were on\\nintimate terms.\\nThe taxi drew up at the Ritz. Tommy burst into its sacred\\nportals eagerly, but his enthusiasm received a check. He was\\ninformed that Miss Cowley had gone out a quarter of an hour ago.\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\nTHE TELEGRAM\\nBAFFLED for the moment, Tommy strolled into the restaurant, and\\nordered a meal of surpassing excellence. His four days\\'\\nimprisonment had taught him anew to value good food.\\nHe was in the middle of conveying a particularly choice morsel of\\nSole a la Jeanette to his mouth, when he caught sight of Julius\\nentering the room. Tommy waved a menu cheerfully, and succeeded\\nin attracting the other\\'s attention. At the sight of Tommy,\\nJulius\\'s eyes seemed as though they would pop out of his head.\\nHe strode across, and pump-handled Tommy\\'s hand with what seemed\\nto the latter quite unnecessary vigour.\\n\"Holy snakes!\" he ejaculated. \"Is it really you?\"\\n\"Of course it is. Why shouldn\\'t it be?\"\\n\"Why shouldn\\'t it be? Say, man, don\\'t you know you\\'ve been given\\nup for dead? I guess we\\'d have had a solemn requiem for you in\\nanother few days.\"\\n\"Who thought I was dead?\" demanded Tommy.\\n\"Tuppence.\"\\n\"She remembered the proverb about the good dying young, I\\nsuppose. There must be a certain amount of original sin in me to\\nhave survived. Where is Tuppence, by the way?\"\\n\"Isn\\'t she here?\"\\n\"No, the fellows at the office said she\\'d just gone out.\"\\n\"Gone shopping, I guess. I dropped her here in the car about an\\nhour ago. But, say, can\\'t you shed that British calm of yours,\\nand get down to it? What on God\\'s earth have you been doing all\\nthis time?\"\\n\"If you\\'re feeding here,\" replied Tommy, \"order now. It\\'s going\\nto be a long story.\"\\nJulius drew up a chair to the opposite side of the table,\\nsummoned a hovering waiter, and dictated his wishes. Then he\\nturned to Tommy.\\n\"Fire ahead. I guess you\\'ve had some few adventures.\"\\n\"One or two,\" replied Tommy modestly, and plunged into his\\nrecital.\\nJulius listened spellbound. Half the dishes that were placed\\nbefore him he forgot to eat. At the end he heaved a long sigh.\\n\"Bully for you. Reads like a dime novel!\"\\n\"And now for the home front,\" said Tommy, stretching out his hand\\nfor a peach.\\n\"We-el,\" drawled Julius, \"I don\\'t mind admitting we\\'ve had some\\nadventures too.\"\\nHe, in his turn, assumed the role of narrator. Beginning with his\\nunsuccessful reconnoitring at Bournemouth, he passed on to his\\nreturn to London, the buying of the car, the growing anxieties of\\nTuppence, the call upon Sir James, and the sensational\\noccurrences of the previous night.\\n\"But who killed her?\" asked Tommy. \"I don\\'t quite understand.\"\\n\"The doctor kidded himself she took it herself,\" replied Julius\\ndryly.\\n\"And Sir James? What did he think?\"\\n\"Being a legal luminary, he is likewise a human oyster,\" replied\\nJulius. \"I should say he \\'reserved judgment.\\' \" He went on to\\ndetail the events of the morning.\\n\"Lost her memory, eh?\" said Tommy with interest. \"By Jove, that\\nexplains why they looked at me so queerly when I spoke of\\nquestioning her. Bit of a slip on my part, that! But it wasn\\'t\\nthe sort of thing a fellow would be likely to guess.\"\\n\"They didn\\'t give you any sort of hint as to where Jane was?\"\\nTommy shook his head regretfully.\\n\"Not a word. I\\'m a bit of an ass, as you know. I ought to have\\ngot more out of them somehow.\"\\n\"I guess you\\'re lucky to be here at all. That bluff of yours was\\nthe goods all right. How you ever came to think of it all so pat\\nbeats me to a frazzle!\"\\n\"I was in such a funk I had to think of something,\" said Tommy\\nsimply.\\nThere was a moment\\'s pause, and then Tommy reverted to Mrs.\\nVandemeyer\\'s death.\\n\"There\\'s no doubt it was chloral?\"\\n\"I believe not. At least they call it heart failure induced by\\nan overdose, or some such claptrap. It\\'s all right. We don\\'t\\nwant to be worried with an inquest. But I guess Tuppence and I\\nand even the highbrow Sir James have all got the same idea.\"\\n\"Mr. Brown?\" hazarded Tommy.\\n\"Sure thing.\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"All the same,\" he said thoughtfully, \"Mr. Brown hasn\\'t got\\nwings. I don\\'t see how he got in and out.\"\\n\"How about some high-class thought transference stunt? Some\\nmagnetic influence that irresistibly impelled Mrs. Vandemeyer to\\ncommit suicide?\"\\nTommy looked at him with respect.\\n\"Good, Julius. Distinctly good. Especially the phraseology. But\\nit leaves me cold. I yearn for a real Mr. Brown of flesh and\\nblood. I think the gifted young detectives must get to work,\\nstudy the entrances and exits, and tap the bumps on their\\nforeheads until the solution of the mystery dawns on them. Let\\'s\\ngo round to the scene of the crime. I wish we could get hold of\\nTuppence. The Ritz would enjoy the spectacle of the glad\\nreunion.\"\\nInquiry at the office revealed the fact that Tuppence had not yet\\nreturned.\\n\"All the same, I guess I\\'ll have a look round upstairs,\" said\\nJulius. \"She might be in my sitting-room.\" He disappeared.\\nSuddenly a diminutive boy spoke at Tommy\\'s elbow:\\n\"The young lady--she\\'s gone away by train, I think, sir,\" he\\nmurmured shyly.\\n\"What?\" Tommy wheeled round upon him.\\nThe small boy became pinker than before.\\n\"The taxi, sir. I heard her tell the driver Charing Cross and to\\nlook sharp.\"\\nTommy stared at him, his eyes opening wide in surprise.\\nEmboldened, the small boy proceeded. \"So I thought, having asked\\nfor an A.B.C. and a Bradshaw.\"\\nTommy interrupted him:\\n\"When did she ask for an A.B.C. and a Bradshaw?\"\\n\"When I took her the telegram, sir.\"\\n\"A telegram?\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\"When was that?\"\\n\"About half-past twelve, sir.\"\\n\"Tell me exactly what happened.\"\\nThe small boy drew a long breath.\\n\"I took up a telegram to No. 891--the lady was there. She opened\\nit and gave a gasp, and then she said, very jolly like: \\'Bring me\\nup a Bradshaw, and an A.B.C., and look sharp, Henry.\\' My name\\nisn\\'t Henry, but----\"\\n\"Never mind your name,\" said Tommy impatiently. \"Go on.\"\\n\"Yes, sir. I brought them, and she told me to wait, and looked\\nup something. And then she looks up at the clock, and \\'Hurry up,\\'\\nshe says. \\'Tell them to get me a taxi,\\' and she begins a-shoving\\non of her hat in front of the glass, and she was down in two\\nticks, almost as quick as I was, and I seed her going down the\\nsteps and into the taxi, and I heard her call out what I told\\nyou.\"\\nThe small boy stopped and replenished his lungs. Tommy continued\\nto stare at him. At that moment Julius rejoined him. He held an\\nopen letter in his hand.\\n\"I say, Hersheimmer\"--Tommy turned to him--\"Tuppence has gone off\\nsleuthing on her own.\"\\n\"Shucks!\"\\n\"Yes, she has. She went off in a taxi to Charing Cross in the\\ndeuce of a hurry after getting a telegram.\" His eye fell on the\\nletter in Julius\\'s hand. \"Oh; she left a note for you. That\\'s\\nall right. Where\\'s she off to?\"\\nAlmost unconsciously, he held out his hand for the letter, but\\nJulius folded it up and placed it in his pocket. He seemed a\\ntrifle embarrassed.\\n\"I guess this is nothing to do with it. It\\'s about something\\nelse--something I asked her that she was to let me know about.\"\\n\"Oh!\" Tommy looked puzzled, and seemed waiting for more.\\n\"See here,\" said Julius suddenly, \"I\\'d better put you wise. I\\nasked Miss Tuppence to marry me this morning.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tommy mechanically. He felt dazed. Julius\\'s words\\nwere totally unexpected. For the moment they benumbed his brain.\\n\"I\\'d like to tell you,\" continued Julius, \"that before I\\nsuggested anything of the kind to Miss Tuppence, I made it clear\\nthat I didn\\'t want to butt in in any way between her and you----\"\\nTommy roused himself.\\n\"That\\'s all right,\" he said quickly. \"Tuppence and I have been\\npals for years. Nothing more.\" He lit a cigarette with a hand\\nthat shook ever so little. \"That\\'s quite all right. Tuppence\\nalways said that she was looking out for----\"\\nHe stopped abruptly, his face crimsoning, but Julius was in no\\nway discomposed.\\n\"Oh, I guess it\\'ll be the dollars that\\'ll do the trick. Miss\\nTuppence put me wise to that right away. There\\'s no humbug about\\nher. We ought to gee along together very well.\"\\nTommy looked at him curiously for a minute, as though he were\\nabout to speak, then changed his mind and said nothing. Tuppence\\nand Julius! Well, why not? Had she not lamented the fact that\\nshe knew no rich men? Had she not openly avowed her intention of\\nmarrying for money if she ever had the chance? Her meeting with\\nthe young American millionaire had given her the chance--and it\\nwas unlikely she would be slow to avail herself of it. She was\\nout for money. She had always said so. Why blame her because\\nshe had been true to her creed?\\nNevertheless, Tommy did blame her. He was filled with a\\npassionate and utterly illogical resentment. It was all very\\nwell to SAY things like that--but a REAL girl would never marry\\nfor money. Tuppence was utterly cold-blooded and selfish, and he\\nwould be delighted if he never saw her again! And it was a\\nrotten world!\\nJulius\\'s voice broke in on these meditations.\\n\"Yes, we ought to get along together very well. I\\'ve heard that\\na girl always refuses you once--a sort of convention.\"\\nTommy caught his arm.\\n\"Refuses? Did you say REFUSES?\"\\n\"Sure thing. Didn\\'t I tell you that? She just rapped out a \\'no\\'\\nwithout any kind of reason to it. The eternal feminine, the Huns\\ncall it, I\\'ve heard. But she\\'ll come round right enough. Likely\\nenough, I hustled her some----\"\\nBut Tommy interrupted regardless of decorum.\\n\"What did she say in that note?\" he demanded fiercely.\\nThe obliging Julius handed it to him.\\n\"There\\'s no earthly clue in it as to where she\\'s gone,\" he\\nassured Tommy. \"But you might as well see for yourself if you\\ndon\\'t believe me.\"\\nThe note, in Tuppence\\'s well-known schoolboy writing, ran as\\nfollows:\\n\"DEAR JULIUS,\\n\"It\\'s always better to have things in black and white. I don\\'t\\nfeel I can be bothered to think of marriage until Tommy is found.\\nLet\\'s leave it till then.\\n\"Yours affectionately,\\n\"TUPPENCE.\"\\nTommy handed it back, his eyes shining. His feelings had\\nundergone a sharp reaction. He now felt that Tuppence was all\\nthat was noble and disinterested. Had she not refused Julius\\nwithout hesitation? True, the note betokened signs of weakening,\\nbut he could excuse that. It read almost like a bribe to Julius\\nto spur him on in his efforts to find Tommy, but he supposed she\\nhad not really meant it that way. Darling Tuppence, there was not\\na girl in the world to touch her! When he saw her----His thoughts\\nwere brought up with a sudden jerk.\\n\"As you say,\" he remarked, pulling himself together, \"there\\'s not\\na hint here as to what she\\'s up to. Hi--Henry!\"\\nThe small boy came obediently. Tommy produced five shillings.\\n\"One thing more. Do you remember what the young lady did with\\nthe telegram?\"\\nHenry gasped and spoke.\\n\"She crumpled it up into a ball and threw it into the grate, and\\nmade a sort of noise like \\'Whoop!\\' sir.\"\\n\"Very graphic, Henry,\" said Tommy. \"Here\\'s your five shillings.\\nCome on, Julius. We must find that telegram.\"\\nThey hurried upstairs. Tuppence had left the key in her door.\\nThe room was as she had left it. In the fireplace was a crumpled\\nball of orange and white. Tommy disentangled it and smoothed out\\nthe telegram.\\n\"Come at once, Moat House, Ebury, Yorkshire, great\\ndevelopments--TOMMY.\"\\nThey looked at each other in stupefaction. Julius spoke first:\\n\"You didn\\'t send it?\"\\n\"Of course not. What does it mean?\"\\n\"I guess it means the worst,\" said Julius quietly. \"They\\'ve got\\nher.\"\\n\"WHAT?\"\\n\"Sure thing! They signed your name, and she fell into the trap\\nlike a lamb.\"\\n\"My God! What shall we do?\"\\n\"Get busy, and go after her! Right now! There\\'s no time to\\nwaste. It\\'s almighty luck that she didn\\'t take the wire with her.\\nIf she had we\\'d probably never have traced her. But we\\'ve got to\\nhustle. Where\\'s that Bradshaw?\"\\nThe energy of Julius was infectious. Left to himself, Tommy\\nwould probably have sat down to think things out for a good\\nhalf-hour before he decided on a plan of action. But with Julius\\nHersheimmer about, hustling was inevitable.\\nAfter a few muttered imprecations he handed the Bradshaw to Tommy\\nas being more conversant with its mysteries. Tommy abandoned it\\nin favour of an A.B.C.\\n\"Here we are. Ebury, Yorks. From King\\'s Cross. Or St. Pancras.\\n(Boy must have made a mistake. It was King\\'s Cross, not CHARING\\nCross.) 12.50, that\\'s the train she went by. 2.10, that\\'s gone.\\n3.20 is the next--and a damned slow train too.\"\\n\"What about the car?\"\\nTommy shook his head.\\n\"Send it up if you like, but we\\'d better stick to the train. The\\ngreat thing is to keep calm.\"\\nJulius groaned.\\n\"That\\'s so. But it gets my goat to think of that innocent young\\ngirl in danger!\"\\nTommy nodded abstractedly. He was thinking. In a moment or two,\\nhe said:\\n\"I say, Julius, what do they want her for, anyway?\"\\n\"Eh? I don\\'t get you?\"\\n\"What I mean is that I don\\'t think it\\'s their game to do her any\\nharm,\" explained Tommy, puckering his brow with the strain of his\\nmental processes. \"She\\'s a hostage, that\\'s what she is. She\\'s in\\nno immediate danger, because if we tumble on to anything, she\\'d\\nbe damned useful to them. As long as they\\'ve got her, they\\'ve got\\nthe whip hand of us. See?\"\\n\"Sure thing,\" said Julius thoughtfully. \"That\\'s so.\"\\n\"Besides,\" added Tommy, as an afterthought, \"I\\'ve great faith in\\nTuppence.\"\\nThe journey was wearisome, with many stops, and crowded\\ncarriages. They had to change twice, once at Doncaster, once at a\\nsmall junction. Ebury was a deserted station with a solitary\\nporter, to whom Tommy addressed himself:\\n\"Can you tell me the way to the Moat House?\"\\n\"The Moat House? It\\'s a tidy step from here. The big house near\\nthe sea, you mean?\"\\nTommy assented brazenly. After listening to the porter\\'s\\nmeticulous but perplexing directions, they prepared to leave the\\nstation. It was beginning to rain, and they turned up the collars\\nof their coats as they trudged through the slush of the road.\\nSuddenly Tommy halted.\\n\"Wait a moment.\" He ran back to the station and tackled the\\nporter anew.\\n\"Look here, do you remember a young lady who arrived by an\\nearlier train, the 12.50 from London? She\\'d probably ask you the\\nway to the Moat House.\"\\nHe described Tuppence as well as he could, but the porter shook\\nhis head. Several people had arrived by the train in question.\\nHe could not call to mind one young lady in particular. But he\\nwas quite certain that no one had asked him the way to the Moat\\nHouse.\\nTommy rejoined Julius, and explained. Depression was settling on\\nhim like a leaden weight. He felt convinced that their quest was\\ngoing to be unsuccessful. The enemy had over three hours\\' start.\\nThree hours was more than enough for Mr. Brown. He would not\\nignore the possibility of the telegram having been found.\\nThe way seemed endless. Once they took the wrong turning and\\nwent nearly half a mile out of their direction. It was past seven\\no\\'clock when a small boy told them that \"t\\' Moat House\" was just\\npast the next corner.\\nA rusty iron gate swinging dismally on its hinges! An overgrown\\ndrive thick with leaves. There was something about the place\\nthat struck a chill to both their hearts. They went up the\\ndeserted drive. The leaves deadened their footsteps. The\\ndaylight was almost gone. It was like walking in a world of\\nghosts. Overhead the branches flapped and creaked with a mournful\\nnote. Occasionally a sodden leaf drifted silently down, startling\\nthem with its cold touch on their cheek.\\nA turn of the drive brought them in sight of the house. That,\\ntoo, seemed empty and deserted. The shutters were closed, the\\nsteps up to the door overgrown with moss. Was it indeed to this\\ndesolate spot that Tuppence had been decoyed? It seemed hard to\\nbelieve that a human footstep had passed this way for months.\\nJulius jerked the rusty bell handle. A jangling peal rang\\ndiscordantly, echoing through the emptiness within. No one came.\\nThey rang again and again--but there was no sign of life. Then\\nthey walked completely round the house. Everywhere silence, and\\nshuttered windows. If they could believe the evidence of their\\neyes the place was empty.\\n\"Nothing doing,\" said Julius.\\nThey retraced their steps slowly to the gate.\\n\"There must be a village handy,\" continued the young American.\\n\"We\\'d better make inquiries there. They\\'ll know something about\\nthe place, and whether there\\'s been anyone there lately.\"\\n\"Yes, that\\'s not a bad idea.\"\\nProceeding up the road, they soon came to a little hamlet. On the\\noutskirts of it, they met a workman swinging his bag of tools,\\nand Tommy stopped him with a question.\\n\"The Moat House? It\\'s empty. Been empty for years. Mrs;\\nSweeny\\'s got the key if you want to go over it--next to the post\\noffice.\"\\nTommy thanked him. They soon found the post office, which was\\nalso a sweet and general fancy shop, and knocked at the door of\\nthe cottage next to it. A clean, wholesome-looking woman opened\\nit. She readily produced the key of the Moat House.\\n\"Though I doubt if it\\'s the kind of place to suit you, sir. In a\\nterrible state of repair. Ceilings leaking and all. \\'Twould need\\na lot of money spent on it.\"\\n\"Thanks,\" said Tommy cheerily. \"I dare say it\\'ll be a washout,\\nbut houses are scarce nowadays.\"\\n\"That they are,\" declared the woman heartily. \"My daughter and\\nson-in-law have been looking for a decent cottage for I don\\'t\\nknow how long. It\\'s all the war. Upset things terribly, it has.\\nBut excuse me, sir, it\\'ll be too dark for you to see much of the\\nhouse. Hadn\\'t you better wait until to-morrow?\"\\n\"That\\'s all right. We\\'ll have a look around this evening,\\nanyway. We\\'d have been here before only we lost our way. What\\'s\\nthe best place to stay at for the night round here?\"\\nMrs. Sweeny looked doubtful.\\n\"There\\'s the Yorkshire Arms, but it\\'s not much of a place for\\ngentlemen like you.\"\\n\"Oh, it will do very well. Thanks. By the way, you\\'ve not had a\\nyoung lady here asking for this key to-day?\"\\nThe woman shook her head.\\n\"No one\\'s been over the place for a long time.\"\\n\"Thanks very much.\"\\nThey retraced their steps to the Moat House. As the front door\\nswung back on its hinges, protesting loudly, Julius struck a\\nmatch and examined the floor carefully. Then he shook his head.\\n\"I\\'d swear no one\\'s passed this way. Look at the dust. Thick.\\nNot a sign of a footmark.\"\\nThey wandered round the deserted house. Everywhere the same\\ntale. Thick layers of dust apparently undisturbed.\\n\"This gets me,\" said Julius. \"I don\\'t believe Tuppence was ever\\nin this house.\"\\n\"She must have been.\"\\nJulius shook his head without replying.\\n\"We\\'ll go over it again to-morrow,\" said Tommy. \"Perhaps we\\'ll\\nsee more in the daylight.\"\\nOn the morrow they took up the search once more, and were\\nreluctantly forced to the conclusion that the house had not been\\ninvaded for some considerable time. They might have left the\\nvillage altogether but for a fortunate discovery of Tommy\\'s. As\\nthey were retracing their steps to the gate, he gave a sudden\\ncry, and stooping, picked something up from among the leaves, and\\nheld it out to Julius. It was a small gold brooch.\\n\"That\\'s Tuppence\\'s!\"\\n\"Are you sure?\"\\n\"Absolutely. I\\'ve often seen her wear it.\"\\nJulius drew a deep breath.\\n\"I guess that settles it. She came as far as here, anyway.\\nWe\\'ll make that pub our head-quarters, and raise hell round here\\nuntil we find her. Somebody MUST have seen her.\"\\nForthwith the campaign began. Tommy and Julius worked separately\\nand together, but the result was the same. Nobody answering to\\nTuppence\\'s description had been seen in the vicinity. They were\\nbaffled--but not discouraged. Finally they altered their\\ntactics. Tuppence had certainly not remained long in the\\nneighbourhood of the Moat House. That pointed to her having been\\novercome and carried away in a car. They renewed inquiries. Had\\nanyone seen a car standing somewhere near the Moat House that\\nday? Again they met with no success.\\nJulius wired to town for his own car, and they scoured the\\nneighbourhood daily with unflagging zeal. A grey limousine on\\nwhich they had set high hopes was traced to Harrogate, and turned\\nout to be the property of a highly respectable maiden lady!\\nEach day saw them set out on a new quest. Julius was like a\\nhound on the leash. He followed up the slenderest clue. Every\\ncar that had passed through the village on the fateful day was\\ntracked down. He forced his way into country properties and\\nsubmitted the owners of the motors to a searching\\ncross-examination. His apologies were as thorough as his methods,\\nand seldom failed in disarming the indignation of his victims;\\nbut, as day succeeded day, they were no nearer to discovering\\nTuppence\\'s whereabouts. So well had the abduction been planned\\nthat the girl seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.\\nAnd another preoccupation was weighing on Tommy\\'s mind.\\n\"Do you know how long we\\'ve been here?\" he asked one morning as\\nthey sat facing each other at breakfast. \"A week! We\\'re no\\nnearer to finding Tuppence, and NEXT SUNDAY IS THE 29TH!\"\\n\"Shucks!\" said Julius thoughtfully. \"I\\'d almost forgotten about\\nthe 29th. I\\'ve been thinking of nothing but Tuppence.\"\\n\"So have I. At least, I hadn\\'t forgotten about the 29th, but it\\ndidn\\'t seem to matter a damn in comparison to finding Tuppence.\\nBut to-day\\'s the 23rd, and time\\'s getting short. If we\\'re ever\\ngoing to get hold of her at all, we must do it before the\\n29th--her life won\\'t be worth an hour\\'s purchase afterwards. The\\nhostage game will be played out by then. I\\'m beginning to feel\\nthat we\\'ve made a big mistake in the way we\\'ve set about this.\\nWe\\'ve wasted time and we\\'re no forrader.\"\\n\"I\\'m with you there. We\\'ve been a couple of mutts, who\\'ve bitten\\noff a bigger bit than they can chew. I\\'m going to quit fooling\\nright away!\"\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\"I\\'ll tell you. I\\'m going to do what we ought to have done a\\nweek ago. I\\'m going right back to London to put the case in the\\nhands of your British police. We fancied ourselves as sleuths.\\nSleuths! It was a piece of damn-fool foolishness! I\\'m through!\\nI\\'ve had enough of it. Scotland Yard for me!\"\\n\"You\\'re right,\" said Tommy slowly. \"I wish to God we\\'d gone\\nthere right away.\"\\n\"Better late than never. We\\'ve been like a couple of babes\\nplaying \\'Here we go round the Mulberry Bush.\\' Now I\\'m going\\nright along to Scotland Yard to ask them to take me by the hand\\nand show me the way I should go. I guess the professional always\\nscores over the amateur in the end. Are you coming along with\\nme?\"\\nTommy shook his head.\\n\"What\\'s the good? One of us is enough. I might as well stay\\nhere and nose round a bit longer. Something MIGHT turn up. One\\nnever knows.\"\\n\"Sure thing. Well, so long. I\\'ll be back in a couple of shakes\\nwith a few inspectors along. I shall tell them to pick out their\\nbrightest and best.\"\\nBut the course of events was not to follow the plan Julius had\\nlaid down. Later in the day Tommy received a wire:\\n\"Join me Manchester Midland Hotel. Important news--JULIUS.\"\\nAt 7:30 that night Tommy alighted from a slow cross-country\\ntrain. Julius was on the platform.\\n\"Thought you\\'d come by this train if you weren\\'t out when my wire\\narrived.\"\\nTommy grasped him by the arm.\\n\"What is it? Is Tuppence found?\"\\nJulius shook his head.\\n\"No. But I found this waiting in London. Just arrived.\"\\nHe handed the telegraph form to the other. Tommy\\'s eyes opened\\nas he read:\\n\"Jane Finn found. Come Manchester Midland Hotel\\nimmediately--PEEL EDGERTON.\"\\nJulius took the form back and folded it up.\\n\"Queer,\" he said thoughtfully. \"I thought that lawyer chap had\\nquit!\"\\nCHAPTER XIX\\nJANE FINN\\n\"MY train got in half an hour ago,\" explained Julius, as he led\\nthe way out of the station. \"I reckoned you\\'d come by this\\nbefore I left London, and wired accordingly to Sir James. He\\'s\\nbooked rooms for us, and will be round to dine at eight.\"\\n\"What made you think he\\'d ceased to take any interest in the\\ncase?\" asked Tommy curiously.\\n\"What he said,\" replied Julius dryly. \"The old bird\\'s as close\\nas an oyster! Like all the darned lot of them, he wasn\\'t going to\\ncommit himself till he was sure he could deliver the goods.\"\\n\"I wonder,\" said Tommy thoughtfully.\\nJulius turned on him.\\n\"You wonder what?\"\\n\"Whether that was his real reason.\"\\n\"Sure. You bet your life it was.\"\\nTommy shook his head unconvinced.\\nSir James arrived punctually at eight o\\'clock, and Julius\\nintroduced Tommy. Sir James shook hands with him warmly.\\n\"I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Mr. Beresford. I have\\nheard so much about you from Miss Tuppence\"--he smiled\\ninvoluntarily--\"that it really seems as though I already know you\\nquite well.\"\\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Tommy with his cheerful grin. He scanned\\nthe great lawyer eagerly. Like Tuppence, he felt the magnetism\\nof the other\\'s personality. He was reminded of Mr. Carter. The\\ntwo men, totally unlike so far as physical resemblance went,\\nproduced a similar effect. Beneath the weary manner of the one\\nand the professional reserve of the other, lay the same quality\\nof mind, keen-edged like a rapier.\\nIn the meantime he was conscious of Sir James\\'s close scrutiny.\\nWhen the lawyer dropped his eyes the young man had the feeling\\nthat the other had read him through and through like an open\\nbook. He could not but wonder what the final judgment was, but\\nthere was little chance of learning that. Sir James took in\\neverything, but gave out only what he chose. A proof of that\\noccurred almost at once.\\nImmediately the first greetings were over Julius broke out into a\\nflood of eager questions. How had Sir James managed to track the\\ngirl? Why had he not let them know that he was still working on\\nthe case? And so on.\\nSir James stroked his chin and smiled. At last he said:\\n\"Just so, just so. Well, she\\'s found. And that\\'s the great\\nthing, isn\\'t it? Eh! Come now, that\\'s the great thing?\"\\n\"Sure it is. But just how did you strike her trail? Miss\\nTuppence and I thought you\\'d quit for good and all.\"\\n\"Ah!\" The lawyer shot a lightning glance at him, then resumed\\noperations on his chin. \"You thought that, did you? Did you\\nreally? H\\'m, dear me.\"\\n\"But I guess I can take it we were wrong,\" pursued Julius.\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know that I should go so far as to say that. But\\nit\\'s certainly fortunate for all parties that we\\'ve managed to\\nfind the young lady.\"\\n\"But where is she?\" demanded Julius, his thoughts flying off on\\nanother tack. \"I thought you\\'d be sure to bring her along?\"\\n\"That would hardly be possible,\" said Sir James gravely.\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Because the young lady was knocked down in a street accident,\\nand has sustained slight injuries to the head. She was taken to\\nthe infirmary, and on recovering consciousness gave her name as\\nJane Finn. When--ah!--I heard that, I arranged for her to be\\nremoved to the house of a doctor--a friend of mine, and wired at\\nonce for you. She relapsed into unconsciousness and has not\\nspoken since.\"\\n\"She\\'s not seriously hurt?\"\\n\"Oh, a bruise and a cut or two; really, from a medical point of\\nview, absurdly slight injuries to have produced such a condition.\\nHer state is probably to be attributed to the mental shock\\nconsequent on recovering her memory.\"\\n\"It\\'s come back?\" cried Julius excitedly.\\nSir James tapped the table rather impatiently.\\n\"Undoubtedly, Mr. Hersheimmer, since she was able to give her\\nreal name. I thought you had appreciated that point.\"\\n\"And you just happened to be on the spot,\" said Tommy. \"Seems\\nquite like a fairy tale.\"\\nBut Sir James was far too wary to be drawn.\\n\"Coincidences are curious things,\" he said dryly.\\nNevertheless Tommy was now certain of what he had before only\\nsuspected. Sir James\\'s presence in Manchester was not accidental.\\nFar from abandoning the case, as Julius supposed, he had by some\\nmeans of his own successfully run the missing girl to earth. The\\nonly thing that puzzled Tommy was the reason for all this\\nsecrecy. He concluded that it was a foible of the legal mind.\\nJulius was speaking.\\n\"After dinner,\" he announced, \"I shall go right away and see\\nJane.\"\\n\"That will be impossible, I fear,\" said Sir James. \"It is very\\nunlikely they would allow her to see visitors at this time of\\nnight. I should suggest to-morrow morning about ten o\\'clock.\"\\nJulius flushed. There was something in Sir James which always\\nstirred him to antagonism. It was a conflict of two masterful\\npersonalities.\\n\"All the same, I reckon I\\'ll go round there to-night and see if I\\ncan\\'t ginger them up to break through their silly rules.\"\\n\"It will be quite useless, Mr. Hersheimmer.\"\\nThe words came out like the crack of a pistol, and Tommy looked\\nup with a start. Julius was nervous and excited. The hand with\\nwhich he raised his glass to his lips shook slightly, but his\\neyes held Sir James\\'s defiantly. For a moment the hostility\\nbetween the two seemed likely to burst into flame, but in the end\\nJulius lowered his eyes, defeated.\\n\"For the moment, I reckon you\\'re the boss.\"\\n\"Thank you,\" said the other. \"We will say ten o\\'clock then?\"\\nWith consummate ease of manner he turned to Tommy. \"I must\\nconfess, Mr. Beresford, that it was something of a surprise to me\\nto see you here this evening. The last I heard of you was that\\nyour friends were in grave anxiety on your behalf. Nothing had\\nbeen heard of you for some days, and Miss Tuppence was inclined\\nto think you had got into difficulties.\"\\n\"I had, sir!\" Tommy grinned reminiscently. \"I was never in a\\ntighter place in my life.\"\\nHelped out by questions from Sir James, he gave an abbreviated\\naccount of his adventures. The lawyer looked at him with renewed\\ninterest as he brought the tale to a close.\\n\"You got yourself out of a tight place very well,\" he said\\ngravely. \"I congratulate you. You displayed a great deal of\\ningenuity and carried your part through well.\"\\nTommy blushed, his face assuming a prawnlike hue at the praise.\\n\"I couldn\\'t have got away but for the girl, sir.\"\\n\"No.\" Sir James smiled a little. \"It was lucky for you she\\nhappened to--er--take a fancy to you.\" Tommy appeared about to\\nprotest, but Sir James went on. \"There\\'s no doubt about her being\\none of the gang, I suppose?\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid not, sir. I thought perhaps they were keeping her\\nthere by force, but the way she acted didn\\'t fit in with that.\\nYou see, she went back to them when she could have got away.\"\\nSir James nodded thoughtfully.\\n\"What did she say? Something about wanting to be taken to\\nMarguerite?\"\\n\"Yes, sir. I suppose she meant Mrs. Vandemeyer.\"\\n\"She always signed herself Rita Vandemeyer. All her friends\\nspoke of her as Rita. Still, I suppose the girl must have been\\nin the habit of calling her by her full name. And, at the moment\\nshe was crying out to her, Mrs. Vandemeyer was either dead or\\ndying! Curious! There are one or two points that strike me as\\nbeing obscure--their sudden change of attitude towards yourself,\\nfor instance. By the way, the house was raided, of course?\"\\n\"Yes, sir, but they\\'d all cleared out.\"\\n\"Naturally,\" said Sir James dryly.\\n\"And not a clue left behind.\"\\n\"I wonder----\" The lawyer tapped the table thoughtfully.\\nSomething in his voice made Tommy look up. Would this man\\'s eyes\\nhave seen something where theirs had been blind? He spoke\\nimpulsively:\\n\"I wish you\\'d been there, sir, to go over the house!\"\\n\"I wish I had,\" said Sir James quietly. He sat for a moment in\\nsilence. Then he looked up. \"And since then? What have you been\\ndoing?\"\\nFor a moment, Tommy stared at him. Then it dawned on him that of\\ncourse the lawyer did not know.\\n\"I forgot that you didn\\'t know about Tuppence,\" he said slowly.\\nThe sickening anxiety, forgotten for a while in the excitement of\\nknowing Jane Finn was found at last, swept over him again.\\nThe lawyer laid down his knife and fork sharply.\\n\"Has anything happened to Miss Tuppence?\" His voice was\\nkeen-edged.\\n\"She\\'s disappeared,\" said Julius.\\n\"When?\"\\n\"A week ago.\"\\n\"How?\"\\nSir James\\'s questions fairly shot out. Between them Tommy and\\nJulius gave the history of the last week and their futile search.\\nSir James went at once to the root of the matter.\\n\"A wire signed with your name? They knew enough of you both for\\nthat. They weren\\'t sure of how much you had learnt in that house.\\nTheir kidnapping of Miss Tuppence is the counter-move to your\\nescape. If necessary they could seal your lips with a threat of\\nwhat might happen to her.\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"That\\'s just what I thought, sir.\"\\nSir James looked at him keenly. \"You had worked that out, had\\nyou? Not bad--not at all bad. The curious thing is that they\\ncertainly did not know anything about you when they first held\\nyou prisoner. You are sure that you did not in any way disclose\\nyour identity?\"\\nTommy shook his head.\\n\"That\\'s so,\" said Julius with a nod. \"Therefore I reckon some\\none put them wise--and not earlier than Sunday afternoon.\"\\n\"Yes, but who?\"\\n\"That almighty omniscient Mr. Brown, of course!\"\\nThere was a faint note of derision in the American\\'s voice which\\nmade Sir James look up sharply.\\n\"You don\\'t believe in Mr. Brown, Mr. Hersheimmer?\"\\n\"No, sir, I do not,\" returned the young American with emphasis.\\n\"Not as such, that is to say. I reckon it out that he\\'s a\\nfigurehead--just a bogy name to frighten the children with. The\\nreal head of this business is that Russian chap Kramenin. I\\nguess he\\'s quite capable of running revolutions in three\\ncountries at once if he chose! The man Whittington is probably\\nthe head of the English branch.\"\\n\"I disagree with you,\" said Sir James shortly. \"Mr. Brown\\nexists.\" He turned to Tommy. \"Did you happen to notice where\\nthat wire was handed in?\"\\n\"No, sir, I\\'m afraid I didn\\'t.\"\\n\"H\\'m. Got it with you?\"\\n\"It\\'s upstairs, sir, in my kit.\"\\n\"I\\'d like to have a look at it sometime. No hurry. You\\'ve\\nwasted a week\"--Tommy hung his head--\"a day or so more is\\nimmaterial. We\\'ll deal with Miss Jane Finn first. Afterwards,\\nwe\\'ll set to work to rescue Miss Tuppence from bondage. I don\\'t\\nthink she\\'s in any immediate danger. That is, so long as they\\ndon\\'t know that we\\'ve got Jane Finn, and that her memory has\\nreturned. We must keep that dark at all costs. You understand?\"\\nThe other two assented, and, after making arrangements for\\nmeeting on the morrow, the great lawyer took his leave.\\nAt ten o\\'clock, the two young men were at the appointed spot. Sir\\nJames had joined them on the doorstep. He alone appeared\\nunexcited. He introduced them to the doctor.\\n\"Mr. Hersheimmer--Mr. Beresford--Dr. Roylance. How\\'s the\\npatient?\"\\n\"Going on well. Evidently no idea of the flight of time. Asked\\nthis morning how many had been saved from the Lusitania. Was it\\nin the papers yet? That, of course, was only what was to be\\nexpected. She seems to have something on her mind, though.\"\\n\"I think we can relieve her anxiety. May we go up?\"\\n\"Certainly.\"\\nTommy\\'s heart beat sensibly faster as they followed the doctor\\nupstairs. Jane Finn at last! The long-sought, the mysterious,\\nthe elusive Jane Finn! How wildly improbable success had seemed!\\nAnd here in this house, her memory almost miraculously restored,\\nlay the girl who held the future of England in her hands. A half\\ngroan broke from Tommy\\'s lips. If only Tuppence could have been\\nat his side to share in the triumphant conclusion of their joint\\nventure! Then he put the thought of Tuppence resolutely aside.\\nHis confidence in Sir James was growing. There was a man who\\nwould unerringly ferret out Tuppence\\'s whereabouts. In the\\nmeantime Jane Finn! And suddenly a dread clutched at his heart.\\nIt seemed too easy.... Suppose they should find her dead ...\\nstricken down by the hand of Mr. Brown?\\nIn another minute he was laughing at these melodramatic fancies.\\nThe doctor held open the door of a room and they passed in. On\\nthe white bed, bandages round her head, lay the girl. Somehow the\\nwhole scene seemed unreal. It was so exactly what one expected\\nthat it gave the effect of being beautifully staged.\\nThe girl looked from one to the other of them with large\\nwondering eyes. Sir James spoke first.\\n\"Miss Finn,\" he said, \"this is your cousin, Mr. Julius P.\\nHersheimmer.\"\\nA faint flush flitted over the girl\\'s face, as Julius stepped\\nforward and took her hand.\\n\"How do, Cousin Jane?\" he said lightly.\\nBut Tommy caught the tremor in his voice.\\n\"Are you really Uncle Hiram\\'s son?\" she asked wonderingly.\\nHer voice, with the slight warmth of the Western accent, had an\\nalmost thrilling quality. It seemed vaguely familiar to Tommy,\\nbut he thrust the impression aside as impossible.\\n\"Sure thing.\"\\n\"We used to read about Uncle Hiram in the papers,\" continued the\\ngirl, in her low soft tones. \"But I never thought I\\'d meet you\\none day. Mother figured it out that Uncle Hiram would never get\\nover being mad with her.\"\\n\"The old man was like that,\" admitted Julius. \"But I guess the\\nnew generation\\'s sort of different. Got no use for the family\\nfeud business. First thing I thought about, soon as the war was\\nover, was to come along and hunt you up.\"\\nA shadow passed over the girl\\'s face.\\n\"They\\'ve been telling me things--dreadful things--that my memory\\nwent, and that there are years I shall never know about--years\\nlost out of my life.\"\\n\"You didn\\'t realize that yourself?\"\\nThe girl\\'s eyes opened wide.\\n\"Why, no. It seems to me as though it were no time since we were\\nbeing hustled into those boats. I can see it all now.\" She\\nclosed her eyes with a shudder.\\nJulius looked across at Sir James, who nodded.\\n\"Don\\'t worry any. It isn\\'t worth it. Now, see here, Jane,\\nthere\\'s something we want to know about. There was a man aboard\\nthat boat with some mighty important papers on him, and the big\\nguns in this country have got a notion that he passed on the\\ngoods to you. Is that so?\"\\nThe girl hesitated, her glance shifting to the other two. Julius\\nunderstood.\\n\"Mr. Beresford is commissioned by the British Government to get\\nthose papers back. Sir James Peel Edgerton is an English Member\\nof Parliament, and might be a big gun in the Cabinet if he liked.\\nIt\\'s owing to him that we\\'ve ferreted you out at last. So you can\\ngo right ahead and tell us the whole story. Did Danvers give you\\nthe papers?\"\\n\"Yes. He said they\\'d have a better chance with me, because they\\nwould save the women and children first.\"\\n\"Just as we thought,\" said Sir James.\\n\"He said they were very important--that they might make all the\\ndifference to the Allies. But, if it\\'s all so long ago, and the\\nwar\\'s over, what does it matter now?\"\\n\"I guess history repeats itself, Jane. First there was a great\\nhue and cry over those papers, then it all died down, and now the\\nwhole caboodle\\'s started all over again--for rather different\\nreasons. Then you can hand them over to us right away?\"\\n\"But I can\\'t.\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"I haven\\'t got them.\"\\n\"You--haven\\'t--got them?\" Julius punctuated the words with\\nlittle pauses.\\n\"No--I hid them.\"\\n\"You hid them?\"\\n\"Yes. I got uneasy. People seemed to be watching me. It scared\\nme--badly.\" She put her hand to her head. \"It\\'s almost the last\\nthing I remember before waking up in the hospital....\"\\n\"Go on,\" said Sir James, in his quiet penetrating tones. \"What do\\nyou remember?\"\\nShe turned to him obediently.\\n\"It was at Holyhead. I came that way--I don\\'t remember why....\"\\n\"That doesn\\'t matter. Go on.\"\\n\"In the confusion on the quay I slipped away. Nobody saw me. I\\ntook a car. Told the man to drive me out of the town. I watched\\nwhen we got on the open road. No other car was following us. I\\nsaw a path at the side of the road. I told the man to wait.\"\\nShe paused, then went on. \"The path led to the cliff, and down\\nto the sea between big yellow gorse bushes--they were like golden\\nflames. I looked round. There wasn\\'t a soul in sight. But just\\nlevel with my head there was a hole in the rock. It was quite\\nsmall--I could only just get my hand in, but it went a long way\\nback. I took the oilskin packet from round my neck and shoved it\\nright in as far as I could. Then I tore off a bit of gorse--My!\\nbut it did prick--and plugged the hole with it so that you\\'d\\nnever guess there was a crevice of any kind there. Then I marked\\nthe place carefully in my own mind, so that I\\'d find it again.\\nThere was a queer boulder in the path just there--for all the\\nworld like a dog sitting up begging. Then I went back to the\\nroad. The car was waiting, and I drove back. I just caught the\\ntrain. I was a bit ashamed of myself for fancying things maybe,\\nbut, by and by, I saw the man opposite me wink at a woman who was\\nsitting next to me, and I felt scared again, and was glad the\\npapers were safe. I went out in the corridor to get a little air.\\nI thought I\\'d slip into another carriage. But the woman called\\nme back, said I\\'d dropped something, and when I stooped to look,\\nsomething seemed to hit me--here.\" She placed her hand to the\\nback of her head. \"I don\\'t remember anything more until I woke up\\nin the hospital.\"\\nThere was a pause.\\n\"Thank you, Miss Finn.\" It was Sir James who spoke. \"I hope we\\nhave not tired you?\"\\n\"Oh, that\\'s all right. My head aches a little, but otherwise I\\nfeel fine.\"\\nJulius stepped forward and took her hand again.\\n\"So long, Cousin Jane. I\\'m going to get busy after those papers,\\nbut I\\'ll be back in two shakes of a dog\\'s tail, and I\\'ll tote you\\nup to London and give you the time of your young life before we\\ngo back to the States! I mean it--so hurry up and get well.\"\\nCHAPTER XX\\nTOO LATE\\nIN the street they held an informal council of war. Sir James had\\ndrawn a watch from his pocket. \"The boat train to Holyhead stops\\nat Chester at 12.14. If you start at once I think you can catch\\nthe connection.\"\\nTommy looked up, puzzled.\\n\"Is there any need to hurry, sir? To-day is only the 24th.\"\\n\"I guess it\\'s always well to get up early in the morning,\" said\\nJulius, before the lawyer had time to reply. \"We\\'ll make tracks\\nfor the depot right away.\"\\nA little frown had settled on Sir James\\'s brow.\\n\"I wish I could come with you. I am due to speak at a meeting at\\ntwo o\\'clock. It is unfortunate.\"\\nThe reluctance in his tone was very evident. It was clear, on\\nthe other hand, that Julius was easily disposed to put up with\\nthe loss of the other\\'s company.\\n\"I guess there\\'s nothing complicated about this deal,\" he\\nremarked. \"Just a game of hide-and-seek, that\\'s all.\"\\n\"I hope so,\" said Sir James.\\n\"Sure thing. What else could it be?\"\\n\"You are still young, Mr. Hersheimmer. At my age you will\\nprobably have learnt one lesson. \\'Never underestimate your\\nadversary.\\' \"\\nThe gravity of his tone impressed Tommy, but had little effect\\nupon Julius.\\n\"You think Mr. Brown might come along and take a hand? If he\\ndoes, I\\'m ready for him.\" He slapped his pocket. \"I carry a gun.\\nLittle Willie here travels round with me everywhere.\" He\\nproduced a murderous-looking automatic, and tapped it\\naffectionately before returning it to its home. \"But he won\\'t be\\nneeded this trip. There\\'s nobody to put Mr. Brown wise.\"\\nThe lawyer shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"There was nobody to put Mr. Brown wise to the fact that Mrs.\\nVandemeyer meant to betray him. Nevertheless, MRS. VANDEMEYER\\nDIED WITHOUT SPEAKING.\"\\nJulius was silenced for once, and Sir James added on a lighter\\nnote:\\n\"I only want to put you on your guard. Good-bye, and good luck.\\nTake no unnecessary risks once the papers are in your hands. If\\nthere is any reason to believe that you have been shadowed,\\ndestroy them at once. Good luck to you. The game is in your\\nhands now.\" He shook hands with them both.\\nTen minutes later the two young men were seated in a first-class\\ncarriage en route for Chester.\\nFor a long time neither of them spoke. When at length Julius\\nbroke the silence, it was with a totally unexpected remark.\\n\"Say,\" he observed thoughtfully, \"did you ever make a darned fool\\nof yourself over a girl\\'s face?\"\\nTommy, after a moment\\'s astonishment, searched his mind.\\n\"Can\\'t say I have,\" he replied at last. \"Not that I can\\nrecollect, anyhow. Why?\"\\n\"Because for the last two months I\\'ve been making a sentimental\\nidiot of myself over Jane! First moment I clapped eyes on her\\nphotograph my heart did all the usual stunts you read about in\\nnovels. I guess I\\'m ashamed to admit it, but I came over here\\ndetermined to find her and fix it all up, and take her back as\\nMrs. Julius P. Hersheimmer!\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tommy, amazed.\\nJulius uncrossed his legs brusquely and continued:\\n\"Just shows what an almighty fool a man can make of himself! One\\nlook at the girl in the flesh, and I was cured!\"\\nFeeling more tongue-tied than ever, Tommy ejaculated \"Oh!\" again.\\n\"No disparagement to Jane, mind you,\" continued the other. \"She\\'s\\na real nice girl, and some fellow will fall in love with her\\nright away.\"\\n\"I thought her a very good-looking girl,\" said Tommy, finding his\\ntongue.\\n\"Sure she is. But she\\'s not like her photo one bit. At least I\\nsuppose she is in a way--must be--because I recognized her right\\noff. If I\\'d seen her in a crowd I\\'d have said \\'There\\'s a girl\\nwhose face I know\\' right away without any hesitation. But there\\nwas something about that photo\"--Julius shook his head, and\\nheaved a sigh--\"I guess romance is a mighty queer thing!\"\\n\"It must be,\" said Tommy coldly, \"if you can come over here in\\nlove with one girl, and propose to another within a fortnight.\"\\nJulius had the grace to look discomposed.\\n\"Well, you see, I\\'d got a sort of tired feeling that I\\'d never\\nfind Jane--and that it was all plumb foolishness anyway. And\\nthen--oh, well, the French, for instance, are much more sensible\\nin the way they look at things. They keep romance and marriage\\napart----\"\\nTommy flushed.\\n\"Well, I\\'m damned! If that\\'s----\"\\nJulius hastened to interrupt.\\n\"Say now, don\\'t be hasty. I don\\'t mean what you mean. I take it\\nAmericans have a higher opinion of morality than you have even.\\nWhat I meant was that the French set about marriage in a\\nbusinesslike way--find two people who are suited to one another,\\nlook after the money affairs, and see the whole thing\\npractically, and in a businesslike spirit.\"\\n\"If you ask me,\" said Tommy, \"we\\'re all too damned businesslike\\nnowadays. We\\'re always saying, \\'Will it pay?\\' The men are bad\\nenough, and the girls are worse!\"\\n\"Cool down, son. Don\\'t get so heated.\"\\n\"I feel heated,\" said Tommy.\\nJulius looked at him and judged it wise to say no more.\\nHowever, Tommy had plenty of time to cool down before they\\nreached Holyhead, and the cheerful grin had returned to his\\ncountenance as they alighted at their destination.\\nAfter consultation, and with the aid of a road map, they were\\nfairly well agreed as to direction, so were able to hire a taxi\\nwithout more ado and drive out on the road leading to Treaddur\\nBay. They instructed the man to go slowly, and watched narrowly\\nso as not to miss the path. They came to it not long after\\nleaving the town, and Tommy stopped the car promptly, asked in a\\ncasual tone whether the path led down to the sea, and hearing it\\ndid paid off the man in handsome style.\\nA moment later the taxi was slowly chugging back to Holyhead.\\nTommy and Julius watched it out of sight, and then turned to the\\nnarrow path.\\n\"It\\'s the right one, I suppose?\" asked Tommy doubtfully. \"There\\nmust be simply heaps along here.\"\\n\"Sure it is. Look at the gorse. Remember what Jane said?\"\\nTommy looked at the swelling hedges of golden blossom which\\nbordered the path on either side, and was convinced.\\nThey went down in single file, Julius leading. Twice Tommy\\nturned his head uneasily. Julius looked back.\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know. I\\'ve got the wind up somehow. Keep fancying\\nthere\\'s some one following us.\"\\n\"Can\\'t be,\" said Julius positively. \"We\\'d see him.\"\\nTommy had to admit that this was true. Nevertheless, his sense\\nof uneasiness deepened. In spite of himself he believed in the\\nomniscience of the enemy.\\n\"I rather wish that fellow would come along,\" said Julius. He\\npatted his pocket. \"Little William here is just aching for\\nexercise!\"\\n\"Do you always carry it--him--with you?\" inquired Tommy with\\nburning curiosity.\\n\"Most always. I guess you never know what might turn up.\"\\nTommy kept a respectful silence. He was impressed by little\\nWilliam. It seemed to remove the menace of Mr. Brown farther\\naway.\\nThe path was now running along the side of the cliff, parallel to\\nthe sea. Suddenly Julius came to such an abrupt halt that Tommy\\ncannoned into him.\\n\"What\\'s up?\" he inquired.\\n\"Look there. If that doesn\\'t beat the band!\"\\nTommy looked. Standing out half obstructing the path was a huge\\nboulder which certainly bore a fanciful resemblance to a\\n\"begging\" terrier.\\n\"Well,\" said Tommy, refusing to share Julius\\'s emotion, \"it\\'s\\nwhat we expected to see, isn\\'t it?\"\\nJulius looked at him sadly and shook his head.\\n\"British phlegm! Sure we expected it--but it kind of rattles me,\\nall the same, to see it sitting there just where we expected to\\nfind it!\"\\nTommy, whose calm was, perhaps, more assumed than natural, moved\\nhis feet impatiently.\\n\"Push on. What about the hole?\"\\nThey scanned the cliff-side narrowly. Tommy heard himself saying\\nidiotically:\\n\"The gorse won\\'t be there after all these years.\"\\nAnd Julius replied solemnly:\\n\"I guess you\\'re right.\"\\nTommy suddenly pointed with a shaking hand.\\n\"What about that crevice there?\"\\nJulius replied in an awestricken voice:\\n\"That\\'s it--for sure.\"\\nThey looked at each other.\\n\"When I was in France,\" said Tommy reminiscently, \"whenever my\\nbatman failed to call me, he always said that he had come over\\nqueer. I never believed it. But whether he felt it or not,\\nthere IS such a sensation. I\\'ve got it now! Badly!\"\\nHe looked at the rock with a kind of agonized passion.\\n\"Damn it!\" he cried. \"It\\'s impossible! Five years! Think of\\nit! Bird\\'s-nesting boys, picnic parties, thousands of people\\npassing! It can\\'t be there! It\\'s a hundred to one against its\\nbeing there! It\\'s against all reason!\"\\nIndeed, he felt it to be impossible--more, perhaps, because he\\ncould not believe in his own success where so many others had\\nfailed. The thing was too easy, therefore it could not be. The\\nhole would be empty.\\nJulius looked at him with a widening smile.\\n\"I guess you\\'re rattled now all right,\" he drawled with some\\nenjoyment. \"Well, here goes!\" He thrust his hand into the\\ncrevice, and made a slight grimace. \"It\\'s a tight fit. Jane\\'s\\nhand must be a few sizes smaller than mine. I don\\'t feel\\nanything--no--say, what\\'s this? Gee whiz!\" And with a flourish\\nhe waved aloft a small discoloured packet. \"It\\'s the goods all\\nright. Sewn up in oilskin. Hold it while I get my penknife.\"\\nThe unbelievable had happened. Tommy held the precious packet\\ntenderly between his hands. They had succeeded!\\n\"It\\'s queer,\" he murmured idly, \"you\\'d think the stitches would\\nhave rotted. They look just as good as new.\"\\nThey cut them carefully and ripped away the oilskin. Inside was\\na small folded sheet of paper. With trembling fingers they\\nunfolded it. The sheet was blank! They stared at each other,\\npuzzled.\\n\"A dummy?\" hazarded Julius. \"Was Danvers just a decoy?\"\\nTommy shook his head. That solution did not satisfy him.\\nSuddenly his face cleared.\\n\"I\\'ve got it! SYMPATHETIC INK!\"\\n\"You think so?\"\\n\"Worth trying anyhow. Heat usually does the trick. Get some\\nsticks. We\\'ll make a fire.\"\\nIn a few minutes the little fire of twigs and leaves was blazing\\nmerrily. Tommy held the sheet of paper near the glow. The paper\\ncurled a little with the heat. Nothing more.\\nSuddenly Julius grasped his arm, and pointed to where characters\\nwere appearing in a faint brown colour.\\n\"Gee whiz! You\\'ve got it! Say, that idea of yours was great. It\\nnever occurred to me.\"\\nTommy held the paper in position some minutes longer until he\\njudged the heat had done its work. Then he withdrew it. A moment\\nlater he uttered a cry.\\nAcross the sheet in neat brown printing ran the words: WITH THE\\nCOMPLIMENTS OF MR. BROWN.\\nCHAPTER XXI\\nTOMMY MAKES A DISCOVERY\\nFOR a moment or two they stood staring at each other stupidly,\\ndazed with the shock. Somehow, inexplicably, Mr. Brown had\\nforestalled them. Tommy accepted defeat quietly. Not so Julius.\\n\"How in tarnation did he get ahead of us? That\\'s what beats me!\"\\nhe ended up.\\nTommy shook his head, and said dully:\\n\"It accounts for the stitches being new. We might have\\nguessed....\"\\n\"Never mind the darned stitches. How did he get ahead of us? We\\nhustled all we knew. It\\'s downright impossible for anyone to get\\nhere quicker than we did. And, anyway, how did he know? Do you\\nreckon there was a dictaphone in Jane\\'s room? I guess there must\\nhave been.\"\\nBut Tommy\\'s common sense pointed out objections.\\n\"No one could have known beforehand that she was going to be in\\nthat house--much less that particular room.\"\\n\"That\\'s so,\" admitted Julius. \"Then one of the nurses was a\\ncrook and listened at the door. How\\'s that?\"\\n\"I don\\'t see that it matters anyway,\" said Tommy wearily. \"He may\\nhave found out some months ago, and removed the papers,\\nthen----No, by Jove, that won\\'t wash! They\\'d have been published\\nat once.\"\\n\"Sure thing they would! No, some one\\'s got ahead of us to-day by\\nan hour or so. But how they did it gets my goat.\"\\n\"I wish that chap Peel Edgerton had been with us,\" said Tommy\\nthoughtfully.\\n\"Why?\" Julius stared. \"The mischief was done when we came.\"\\n\"Yes----\" Tommy hesitated. He could not explain his own\\nfeeling--the illogical idea that the K.C.\\'s presence would\\nsomehow have averted the catastrophe. He reverted to his former\\npoint of view. \"It\\'s no good arguing about how it was done. The\\ngame\\'s up. We\\'ve failed. There\\'s only one thing for me to do.\"\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\n\"Get back to London as soon as possible. Mr. Carter must be\\nwarned. It\\'s only a matter of hours now before the blow falls.\\nBut, at any rate, he ought to know the worst.\"\\nThe duty was an unpleasant one, but Tommy had no intention of\\nshirking it. He must report his failure to Mr. Carter. After\\nthat his work was done. He took the midnight mail to London.\\nJulius elected to stay the night at Holyhead.\\nHalf an hour after arrival, haggard and pale, Tommy stood before\\nhis chief.\\n\"I\\'ve come to report, sir. I\\'ve failed--failed badly.\"\\nMr. Carter eyed him sharply.\\n\"You mean that the treaty----\"\\n\"Is in the hands of Mr. Brown, sir.\"\\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Carter quietly. The expression on his face did\\nnot change, but Tommy caught the flicker of despair in his eyes.\\nIt convinced him as nothing else had done that the outlook was\\nhopeless.\\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Carter after a minute or two, \"we mustn\\'t sag at\\nthe knees, I suppose. I\\'m glad to know definitely. We must do\\nwhat we can.\"\\nThrough Tommy\\'s mind flashed the assurance: \"It\\'s hopeless, and\\nhe knows it\\'s hopeless!\"\\nThe other looked up at him.\\n\"Don\\'t take it to heart, lad,\" he said kindly. \"You did your\\nbest. You were up against one of the biggest brains of the\\ncentury. And you came very near success. Remember that.\"\\n\"Thank you, sir. It\\'s awfully decent of you.\"\\n\"I blame myself. I have been blaming myself ever since I heard\\nthis other news.\"\\nSomething in his tone attracted Tommy\\'s attention. A new fear\\ngripped at his heart.\\n\"Is there--something more, sir?\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid so,\" said Mr. Carter gravely. He stretched out his\\nhand to a sheet on the table.\\n\"Tuppence----?\" faltered Tommy.\\n\"Read for yourself.\"\\nThe typewritten words danced before his eyes. The description of\\na green toque, a coat with a handkerchief in the pocket marked\\nP.L.C. He looked an agonized question at Mr. Carter. The latter\\nreplied to it:\\n\"Washed up on the Yorkshire coast--near Ebury. I\\'m afraid--it\\nlooks very much like foul play.\"\\n\"My God!\" gasped Tommy. \"TUPPENCE! Those devils--I\\'ll never\\nrest till I\\'ve got even with them! I\\'ll hunt them down!\\nI\\'ll----\"\\nThe pity on Mr. Carter\\'s face stopped him.\\n\"I know what you feel like, my poor boy. But it\\'s no good.\\nYou\\'ll waste your strength uselessly. It may sound harsh, but my\\nadvice to you is: Cut your losses. Time\\'s merciful. You\\'ll\\nforget.\"\\n\"Forget Tuppence? Never!\"\\nMr. Carter shook his head.\\n\"So you think now. Well, it won\\'t bear thinking of--that brave\\nlittle girl! I\\'m sorry about the whole business--confoundedly\\nsorry.\"\\nTommy came to himself with a start.\\n\"I\\'m taking up your time, sir,\" he said with an effort. \"There\\'s\\nno need for you to blame yourself. I dare say we were a couple\\nof young fools to take on such a job. You warned us all right.\\nBut I wish to God I\\'d been the one to get it in the neck.\\nGood-bye, sir.\"\\nBack at the Ritz, Tommy packed up his few belongings\\nmechanically, his thoughts far away. He was still bewildered by\\nthe introduction of tragedy into his cheerful commonplace\\nexistence. What fun they had had together, he and Tuppence! And\\nnow--oh, he couldn\\'t believe it--it couldn\\'t be true!\\nTUPPENCE--DEAD! Little Tuppence, brimming over with life! It was\\na dream, a horrible dream. Nothing more.\\nThey brought him a note, a few kind words of sympathy from Peel\\nEdgerton, who had read the news in the paper. (There had been a\\nlarge headline: EX-V.A.D. FEARED DROWNED.) The letter ended with\\nthe offer of a post on a ranch in the Argentine, where Sir James\\nhad considerable interests.\\n\"Kind old beggar,\" muttered Tommy, as he flung it aside.\\nThe door opened, and Julius burst in with his usual violence. He\\nheld an open newspaper in his hand.\\n\"Say, what\\'s all this? They seem to have got some fool idea\\nabout Tuppence.\"\\n\"It\\'s true,\" said Tommy quietly.\\n\"You mean they\\'ve done her in?\"\\nTommy nodded.\\n\"I suppose when they got the treaty she--wasn\\'t any good to them\\nany longer, and they were afraid to let her go.\"\\n\"Well, I\\'m darned!\" said Julius. \"Little Tuppence. She sure was\\nthe pluckiest little girl----\"\\nBut suddenly something seemed to crack in Tommy\\'s brain. He rose\\nto his feet.\\n\"Oh, get out! You don\\'t really care, damn you! You asked her to\\nmarry you in your rotten cold-blooded way, but I LOVED her. I\\'d\\nhave given the soul out of my body to save her from harm. I\\'d\\nhave stood by without a word and let her marry you, because you\\ncould have given her the sort of time she ought to have had, and\\nI was only a poor devil without a penny to bless himself with.\\nBut it wouldn\\'t have been because I didn\\'t care!\"\\n\"See here,\" began Julius temperately.\\n\"Oh, go to the devil! I can\\'t stand your coming here and talking\\nabout \\'little Tuppence.\\' Go and look after your cousin.\\nTuppence is my girl! I\\'ve always loved her, from the time we\\nplayed together as kids. We grew up and it was just the same. I\\nshall never forget when I was in hospital, and she came in in\\nthat ridiculous cap and apron! It was like a miracle to see the\\ngirl I loved turn up in a nurse\\'s kit----\"\\nBut Julius interrupted him.\\n\"A nurse\\'s kit! Gee whiz! I must be going to Colney Hatch! I\\ncould swear I\\'ve seen Jane in a nurse\\'s cap too. And that\\'s\\nplumb impossible! No, by gum, I\\'ve got it! It was her I saw\\ntalking to Whittington at that nursing home in Bournemouth. She\\nwasn\\'t a patient there! She was a nurse!\"\\n\"I dare say,\" said Tommy angrily, \"she\\'s probably been in with\\nthem from the start. I shouldn\\'t wonder if she stole those\\npapers from Danvers to begin with.\"\\n\"I\\'m darned if she did!\" shouted Julius. \"She\\'s my cousin, and\\nas patriotic a girl as ever stepped.\"\\n\"I don\\'t care a damn what she is, but get out of here!\" retorted\\nTommy also at the top of his voice.\\nThe young men were on the point of coming to blows. But\\nsuddenly, with an almost magical abruptness, Julius\\'s anger\\nabated.\\n\"All right, son,\" he said quietly, \"I\\'m going. I don\\'t blame you\\nany for what you\\'ve been saying. It\\'s mighty lucky you did say\\nit. I\\'ve been the most almighty blithering darned idiot that\\nit\\'s possible to imagine. Calm down\"--Tommy had made an impatient\\ngesture--\"I\\'m going right away now--going to the London and North\\nWestern Railway depot, if you want to know.\"\\n\"I don\\'t care a damn where you\\'re going,\" growled Tommy.\\nAs the door closed behind Julius, he returned to his suit-case.\\n\"That\\'s the lot,\" he murmured, and rang the bell.\\n\"Take my luggage down.\"\\n\"Yes, sir. Going away, sir?\"\\n\"I\\'m going to the devil,\" said Tommy, regardless of the menial\\'s\\nfeelings.\\nThat functionary, however, merely replied respectfully:\\n\"Yes, sir. Shall I call a taxi?\"\\nTommy nodded.\\nWhere was he going? He hadn\\'t the faintest idea. Beyond a fixed\\ndetermination to get even with Mr. Brown he had no plans. He\\nre-read Sir James\\'s letter, and shook his head. Tuppence must be\\navenged. Still, it was kind of the old fellow.\\n\"Better answer it, I suppose.\" He went across to the\\nwriting-table. With the usual perversity of bedroom stationery,\\nthere were innumerable envelopes and no paper. He rang. No one\\ncame. Tommy fumed at the delay. Then he remembered that there\\nwas a good supply in Julius\\'s sitting-room. The American had\\nannounced his immediate departure, there would be no fear of\\nrunning up against him. Besides, he wouldn\\'t mind if he did. He\\nwas beginning to be rather ashamed of the things he had said. Old\\nJulius had taken them jolly well. He\\'d apologize if he found him\\nthere.\\nBut the room was deserted. Tommy walked across to the\\nwriting-table, and opened the middle drawer. A photograph,\\ncarelessly thrust in face upwards, caught his eye. For a moment\\nhe stood rooted to the ground. Then he took it out, shut the\\ndrawer, walked slowly over to an arm-chair, and sat down still\\nstaring at the photograph in his hand.\\nWhat on earth was a photograph of the French girl Annette doing\\nin Julius Hersheimmer\\'s writing-table?\\nCHAPTER XXII\\nIN DOWNING STREET\\nTHE Prime Minister tapped the desk in front of him with nervous\\nfingers. His face was worn and harassed. He took up his\\nconversation with Mr. Carter at the point it had broken off. \"I\\ndon\\'t understand,\" he said. \"Do you really mean that things are\\nnot so desperate after all?\"\\n\"So this lad seems to think.\"\\n\"Let\\'s have a look at his letter again.\"\\nMr. Carter handed it over. It was written in a sprawling boyish\\nhand.\\n\"DEAR MR. CARTER,\\n\"Something\\'s turned up that has given me a jar. Of course I may\\nbe simply making an awful ass of myself, but I don\\'t think so. If\\nmy conclusions are right, that girl at Manchester was just a\\nplant. The whole thing was prearranged, sham packet and all, with\\nthe object of making us think the game was up--therefore I fancy\\nthat we must have been pretty hot on the scent.\\n\"I think I know who the real Jane Finn is, and I\\'ve even got an\\nidea where the papers are. That last\\'s only a guess, of course,\\nbut I\\'ve a sort of feeling it\\'ll turn out right. Anyhow, I\\nenclose it in a sealed envelope for what it\\'s worth. I\\'m going to\\nask you not to open it until the very last moment, midnight on\\nthe 28th, in fact. You\\'ll understand why in a minute. You see,\\nI\\'ve figured it out that those things of Tuppence\\'s are a plant\\ntoo, and she\\'s no more drowned than I am. The way I reason is\\nthis: as a last chance they\\'ll let Jane Finn escape in the hope\\nthat she\\'s been shamming this memory stunt, and that once she\\nthinks she\\'s free she\\'ll go right away to the cache. Of course\\nit\\'s an awful risk for them to take, because she knows all about\\nthem--but they\\'re pretty desperate to get hold of that treaty.\\nBUT IF THEY KNOW THAT THE PAPERS HAVE BEEN RECOVERED BY US,\\nneither of those two girls\\' lives will be worth an hour\\'s\\npurchase. I must try and get hold of Tuppence before Jane\\nescapes.\\n\"I want a repeat of that telegram that was sent to Tuppence at\\nthe Ritz. Sir James Peel Edgerton said you would be able to\\nmanage that for me. He\\'s frightfully clever.\\n\"One last thing--please have that house in Soho watched day and\\nnight.\\n\"Yours, etc.,\\n\"THOMAS BERESFORD.\"\\nThe Prime Minister looked up.\\n\"The enclosure?\"\\nMr. Carter smiled dryly.\\n\"In the vaults of the Bank. I am taking no chances.\"\\n\"You don\\'t think\"--the Prime Minister hesitated a minute--\"that\\nit would be better to open it now? Surely we ought to secure the\\ndocument, that is, provided the young man\\'s guess turns out to be\\ncorrect, at once. We can keep the fact of having done so quite\\nsecret.\"\\n\"Can we? I\\'m not so sure. There are spies all round us. Once\\nit\\'s known I wouldn\\'t give that\"--he snapped his fingers--\"for\\nthe life of those two girls. No, the boy trusted me, and I\\nshan\\'t let him down.\"\\n\"Well, well, we must leave it at that, then. What\\'s he like,\\nthis lad?\"\\n\"Outwardly, he\\'s an ordinary clean-limbed, rather block-headed\\nyoung Englishman. Slow in his mental processes. On the other\\nhand, it\\'s quite impossible to lead him astray through his\\nimagination. He hasn\\'t got any--so he\\'s difficult to deceive. He\\nworries things out slowly, and once he\\'s got hold of anything he\\ndoesn\\'t let go. The little lady\\'s quite different. More\\nintuition and less common sense. They make a pretty pair working\\ntogether. Pace and stamina.\"\\n\"He seems confident,\" mused the Prime Minister.\\n\"Yes, and that\\'s what gives me hope. He\\'s the kind of diffident\\nyouth who would have to be VERY sure before he ventured an\\nopinion at all.\"\\nA half smile came to the other\\'s lips.\\n\"And it is this--boy who will defeat the master criminal of our\\ntime?\"\\n\"This--boy, as you say! But I sometimes fancy I see a shadow\\nbehind.\"\\n\"You mean?\"\\n\"Peel Edgerton.\"\\n\"Peel Edgerton?\" said the Prime Minister in astonishment.\\n\"Yes. I see his hand in THIS.\" He struck the open letter. \"He\\'s\\nthere--working in the dark, silently, unobtrusively. I\\'ve always\\nfelt that if anyone was to run Mr. Brown to earth, Peel Edgerton\\nwould be the man. I tell you he\\'s on the case now, but doesn\\'t\\nwant it known. By the way, I got rather an odd request from him\\nthe other day.\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"He sent me a cutting from some American paper. It referred to a\\nman\\'s body found near the docks in New York about three weeks\\nago. He asked me to collect any information on the subject I\\ncould.\"\\n\"Well?\"\\nCarter shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"I couldn\\'t get much. Young fellow about thirty-five--poorly\\ndressed--face very badly disfigured. He was never identified.\"\\n\"And you fancy that the two matters are connected in some way?\"\\n\"Somehow I do. I may be wrong, of course.\"\\nThere was a pause, then Mr. Carter continued:\\n\"I asked him to come round here. Not that we\\'ll get anything out\\nof him he doesn\\'t want to tell. His legal instincts are too\\nstrong. But there\\'s no doubt he can throw light on one or two\\nobscure points in young Beresford\\'s letter. Ah, here he is!\"\\nThe two men rose to greet the new-comer. A half whimsical thought\\nflashed across the Premier\\'s mind. \"My successor, perhaps!\"\\n\"We\\'ve had a letter from young Beresford,\" said Mr. Carter,\\ncoming to the point at once. \"You\\'ve seen him, I suppose?\"\\n\"You suppose wrong,\" said the lawyer.\\n\"Oh!\" Mr. Carter was a little nonplussed.\\nSir James smiled, and stroked his chin.\\n\"He rang me up,\" he volunteered.\\n\"Would you have any objection to telling us exactly what passed\\nbetween you?\"\\n\"Not at all. He thanked me for a certain letter which I had\\nwritten to him--as a matter of fact, I had offered him a job.\\nThen he reminded me of something I had said to him at Manchester\\nrespecting that bogus telegram which lured Miss Cowley away. I\\nasked him if anything untoward had occurred. He said it\\nhad--that in a drawer in Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s room he had discovered\\na photograph.\" The laywer{sic} paused, then continued: \"I asked\\nhim if the photograph bore the name and address of a Californian\\nphotographer. He replied: \\'You\\'re on to it, sir. It had.\\' Then\\nhe went on to tell me something I DIDN\\'T know. The original of\\nthat photograph was the French girl, Annette, who saved his\\nlife.\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"Exactly. I asked the young man with some curiosity what he had\\ndone with the photograph. He replied that he had put it back\\nwhere he found it.\" The lawyer paused again. \"That was good, you\\nknow--distinctly good. He can use his brains, that young fellow.\\nI congratulated him. The discovery was a providential one. Of\\ncourse, from the moment that the girl in Manchester was proved to\\nbe a plant everything was altered. Young Beresford saw that for\\nhimself without my having to tell it him. But he felt he couldn\\'t\\ntrust his judgment on the subject of Miss Cowley. Did I think\\nshe was alive? I told him, duly weighing the evidence, that\\nthere was a very decided chance in favour of it. That brought us\\nback to the telegram.\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"I advised him to apply to you for a copy of the original wire.\\nIt had occurred to me as probable that, after Miss Cowley flung\\nit on the floor, certain words might have been erased and altered\\nwith the express intention of setting searchers on a false\\ntrail.\"\\nCarter nodded. He took a sheet from his pocket, and read aloud:\\n\"Come at once, Astley Priors, Gatehouse, Kent. Great\\ndevelopments--TOMMY.\\n\"Very simple,\" said Sir James, \"and very ingenious. Just a few\\nwords to alter, and the thing was done. And the one important\\nclue they overlooked.\"\\n\"What was that?\"\\n\"The page-boy\\'s statement that Miss Cowley drove to Charing\\nCross. They were so sure of themselves that they took it for\\ngranted he had made a mistake.\"\\n\"Then young Beresford is now?\"\\n\"At Gatehouse, Kent, unless I am much mistaken.\"\\nMr. Carter looked at him curiously.\\n\"I rather wonder you\\'re not there too, Peel Edgerton?\"\\n\"Ah, I\\'m busy on a case.\"\\n\"I thought you were on your holiday?\"\\n\"Oh, I\\'ve not been briefed. Perhaps it would be more correct to\\nsay I\\'m preparing a case. Any more facts about that American\\nchap for me?\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid not. Is it important to find out who he was?\"\\n\"Oh, I know who he was,\" said Sir James easily. \"I can\\'t prove\\nit yet--but I know.\"\\nThe other two asked no questions. They had an instinct that it\\nwould be mere waste of breath.\\n\"But what I don\\'t understand,\" said the Prime-Minister suddenly,\\n\"is how that photograph came to be in Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s drawer?\"\\n\"Perhaps it never left it,\" suggested the lawyer gently.\\n\"But the bogus inspector? Inspector Brown?\"\\n\"Ah!\" said Sir James thoughtfully. He rose to his feet. \"I\\nmustn\\'t keep you. Go on with the affairs of the nation. I must\\nget back to--my case.\"\\nTwo days later Julius Hersheimmer returned from Manchester. A\\nnote from Tommy lay on his table:\\n\"DEAR HERSHEIMMER,\\n\"Sorry I lost my temper. In case I don\\'t see you again,\\ngood-bye. I\\'ve been offered a job in the Argentine, and might as\\nwell take it. \"Yours,\\n\"TOMMY BERESFORD.\"\\nA peculiar smile lingered for a moment on Julius\\'s face. He threw\\nthe letter into the waste-paper basket.\\n\"The darned fool!\" he murmured.\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\nA RACE AGAINST TIME\\nAFTER ringing up Sir James, Tommy\\'s next procedure was to make a\\ncall at South Audley Mansions. He found Albert discharging his\\nprofessional duties, and introduced himself without more ado as a\\nfriend of Tuppence\\'s. Albert unbent immediately.\\n\"Things has been very quiet here lately,\" he said wistfully.\\n\"Hope the young lady\\'s keeping well, sir?\"\\n\"That\\'s just the point, Albert. She\\'s disappeared.\" You don\\'t\\nmean as the crooks have got her?\"\\n\"In the Underworld?\"\\n\"No, dash it all, in this world!\"\\n\"It\\'s a h\\'expression, sir,\" explained Albert. \"At the pictures\\nthe crooks always have a restoorant in the Underworld. But do\\nyou think as they\\'ve done her in, sir?\"\\n\"I hope not. By the way, have you by any chance an aunt, a\\ncousin, a grandmother, or any other suitable female relation who\\nmight be represented as being likely to kick the bucket?\"\\nA delighted grin spread slowly over Albert\\'s countenance.\\n\"I\\'m on, sir. My poor aunt what lives in the country has been\\nmortal bad for a long time, and she\\'s asking for me with her\\ndying breath.\"\\nTommy nodded approval.\\n\"Can you report this in the proper quarter and meet me at Charing\\nCross in an hour\\'s time?\"\\n\"I\\'ll be there, sir. You can count on me.\"\\nAs Tommy had judged, the faithful Albert proved an invaluable\\nally. The two took up their quarters at the inn in Gatehouse. To\\nAlbert fell the task of collecting information There was no\\ndifficulty about it.\\nAstley Priors was the property of a Dr. Adams. The doctor no\\nlonger practiced, had retired, the landlord believed, but he took\\na few private patients--here the good fellow tapped his forehead\\nknowingly--\"balmy ones! You understand!\" The doctor was a\\npopular figure in the village, subscribed freely to all the local\\nsports--\"a very pleasant, affable gentleman.\" Been there long?\\nOh, a matter of ten years or so--might be longer. Scientific\\ngentleman, he was. Professors and people often came down from\\ntown to see him. Anyway, it was a gay house, always visitors.\\nIn the face of all this volubility, Tommy felt doubts. Was it\\npossible that this genial, well-known figure could be in reality\\na dangerous criminal? His life seemed so open and aboveboard. No\\nhint of sinister doings. Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake?\\nTommy felt a cold chill at the thought.\\nThen he remembered the private patients--\"balmy ones.\" He\\ninquired carefully if there was a young lady amongst them,\\ndescribing Tuppence. But nothing much seemed to be known about\\nthe patients--they were seldom seen outside the grounds. A\\nguarded description of Annette also failed to provoke\\nrecognition.\\nAstley Priors was a pleasant red-brick edifice, surrounded by\\nwell-wooded grounds which effectually shielded the house from\\nobservation from the road.\\nOn the first evening Tommy, accompanied by Albert, explored the\\ngrounds. Owing to Albert\\'s insistence they dragged themselves\\nalong painfully on their stomachs, thereby producing a great deal\\nmore noise than if they had stood upright. In any case, these\\nprecautions were totally unnecessary. The grounds, like those of\\nany other private house after nightfall, seemed untenanted.\\nTommy had imagined a possible fierce watchdog. Albert\\'s fancy ran\\nto a puma, or a tame cobra. But they reached a shrubbery near\\nthe house quite unmolested.\\nThe blinds of the dining-room window were up. There was a large\\ncompany assembled round the table. The port was passing from\\nhand to hand. It seemed a normal, pleasant company. Through the\\nopen window scraps of conversation floated out disjointedly on\\nthe night air. It was a heated discussion on county cricket!\\nAgain Tommy felt that cold chill of uncertainty. It seemed\\nimpossible to believe that these people were other than they\\nseemed. Had he been fooled once more? The fair-bearded,\\nspectacled gentleman who sat at the head of the table looked\\nsingularly honest and normal.\\nTommy slept badly that night. The following morning the\\nindefatigable Albert, having cemented an alliance with the\\ngreengrocer\\'s boy, took the latter\\'s place and ingratiated\\nhimself with the cook at Malthouse. He returned with the\\ninformation that she was undoubtedly \"one of the crooks,\" but\\nTommy mistrusted the vividness of his imagination. Questioned,\\nhe could adduce nothing in support of his statement except his\\nown opinion that she wasn\\'t the usual kind. You could see that\\nat a glance.\\nThe substitution being repeated (much to the pecuniary advantage\\nof the real greengrocer\\'s boy) on the following day, Albert\\nbrought back the first piece of hopeful news. There WAS a French\\nyoung lady staying in the house. Tommy put his doubts aside.\\nHere was confirmation of his theory. But time pressed. To-day\\nwas the 27th. The 29th was the much-talked-of \"Labour Day,\"\\nabout which all sorts of rumours were running riot. Newspapers\\nwere getting agitated. Sensational hints of a Labour coup d\\'etat\\nwere freely reported. The Government said nothing. It knew and\\nwas prepared. There were rumours of dissension among the Labour\\nleaders. They were not of one mind. The more far-seeing among\\nthem realized that what they proposed might well be a death-blow\\nto the England that at heart they loved. They shrank from the\\nstarvation and misery a general strike would entail, and were\\nwilling to meet the Government half-way. But behind them were\\nsubtle, insistent forces at work, urging the memories of old\\nwrongs, deprecating the weakness of half-and-half measures,\\nfomenting misunderstandings.\\nTommy felt that, thanks to Mr. Carter, he understood the position\\nfairly accurately. With the fatal document in the hands of Mr.\\nBrown, public opinion would swing to the side of the Labour\\nextremists and revolutionists. Failing that, the battle was an\\neven chance. The Government with a loyal army and police force\\nbehind them might win--but at a cost of great suffering. But\\nTommy nourished another and a preposterous dream. With Mr. Brown\\nunmasked and captured he believed, rightly or wrongly, that the\\nwhole organization would crumble ignominiously and\\ninstantaneously. The strange permeating influence of the unseen\\nchief held it together. Without him, Tommy believed an instant\\npanic would set in; and, the honest men left to themselves, an\\neleventh-hour reconciliation would be possible.\\n\"This is a one-man show,\" said Tommy to himself. \"The thing to do\\nis to get hold of the man.\"\\nIt was partly in furtherance of this ambitious design that he had\\nrequested Mr. Carter not to open the sealed envelope. The draft\\ntreaty was Tommy\\'s bait. Every now and then he was aghast at his\\nown presumption. How dared he think that he had discovered what\\nso many wiser and clever men had overlooked? Nevertheless, he\\nstuck tenaciously to his idea.\\nThat evening he and Albert once more penetrated the grounds of\\nAstley Priors. Tommy\\'s ambition was somehow or other to gain\\nadmission to the house itself. As they approached cautiously,\\nTommy gave a sudden gasp.\\nOn the second floor window some one standing between the window\\nand the light in the room threw a silhouette on the blind. It was\\none Tommy would have recognized anywhere! Tuppence was in that\\nhouse!\\nHe clutched Albert by the shoulder.\\n\"Stay here! When I begin to sing, watch that window.\"\\nHe retreated hastily to a position on the main drive, and began\\nin a deep roar, coupled with an unsteady gait, the following\\nditty:\\nI am a Soldier A jolly British Soldier;\\nYou can see that I\\'m a Soldier by my feet . . .\\nIt had been a favourite on the gramophone in Tuppence\\'s hospital\\ndays. He did not doubt but that she would recognize it and draw\\nher own conclusions. Tommy had not a note of music in his voice,\\nbut his lungs were excellent. The noise he produced was terrific.\\nPresently an unimpeachable butler, accompanied by an equally\\nunimpeachable footman, issued from the front door. The butler\\nremonstrated with him. Tommy continued to sing, addressing the\\nbutler affectionately as \"dear old whiskers.\" The footman took\\nhim by one arm, the butler by the other. They ran him down the\\ndrive, and neatly out of the gate. The butler threatened him with\\nthe police if he intruded again. It was beautifully done--soberly\\nand with perfect decorum. Anyone would have sworn that the butler\\nwas a real butler, the footman a real footman--only, as it\\nhappened, the butler was Whittington!\\nTommy retired to the inn and waited for Albert\\'s return. At last\\nthat worthy made his appearance.\\n\"Well?\" cried Tommy eagerly.\\n\"It\\'s all right. While they was a-running of you out the window\\nopened, and something was chucked out.\" He handed a scrap of\\npaper to Tommy. \"It was wrapped round a letterweight.\"\\nOn the paper were scrawled three words: \"To-morrow--same time.\"\\n\"Good egg!\" cried Tommy. \"We\\'re getting going.\"\\n\"I wrote a message on a piece of paper, wrapped it round a stone,\\nand chucked it through the window,\" continued Albert\\nbreathlessly.\\nTommy groaned.\\n\"Your zeal will be the undoing of us, Albert. What did you say?\"\\n\"Said we was a-staying at the inn. If she could get away, to\\ncome there and croak like a frog.\"\\n\"She\\'ll know that\\'s you,\" said Tommy with a sigh of relief. \"Your\\nimagination runs away with you, you know, Albert. Why, you\\nwouldn\\'t recognize a frog croaking if you heard it.\"\\nAlbert looked rather crest-fallen.\\n\"Cheer up,\" said Tommy. \"No harm done. That butler\\'s an old\\nfriend of mine--I bet he knew who I was, though he didn\\'t let on.\\nIt\\'s not their game to show suspicion. That\\'s why we\\'ve found it\\nfairly plain sailing. They don\\'t want to discourage me\\naltogether. On the other hand, they don\\'t want to make it too\\neasy. I\\'m a pawn in their game, Albert, that\\'s what I am. You\\nsee, if the spider lets the fly walk out too easily, the fly\\nmight suspect it was a put-up job. Hence the usefulness of that\\npromising youth, Mr. T. Beresford, who\\'s blundered in just at the\\nright moment for them. But later, Mr. T. Beresford had better\\nlook out!\"\\nTommy retired for the night in a state of some elation. He had\\nelaborated a careful plan for the following evening. He felt sure\\nthat the inhabitants of Astley Priors would not interfere with\\nhim up to a certain point. It was after that that Tommy proposed\\nto give them a surprise.\\nAbout twelve o\\'clock, however, his calm was rudely shaken. He was\\ntold that some one was demanding him in the bar. The applicant\\nproved to be a rude-looking carter well coated with mud.\\n\"Well, my good fellow, what is it?\" asked Tommy.\\n\"Might this be for you, sir?\" The carter held out a very dirty\\nfolded note, on the outside of which was written: \"Take this to\\nthe gentleman at the inn near Astley Priors. He will give you\\nten shillings.\"\\nThe handwriting was Tuppence\\'s. Tommy appreciated her\\nquick-wittedness in realizing that he might be staying at the inn\\nunder an assumed name. He snatched at it.\\n\"That\\'s all right.\"\\nThe man withheld it.\\n\"What about my ten shillings?\"\\nTommy hastily produced a ten-shilling note, and the man\\nrelinquished his find. Tommy unfastened it.\\n\"DEAR TOMMY,\\n\"I knew it was you last night. Don\\'t go this evening. They\\'ll be\\nlying in wait for you. They\\'re taking us away this morning. I\\nheard something about Wales--Holyhead, I think. I\\'ll drop this on\\nthe road if I get a chance. Annette told me how you\\'d escaped.\\nBuck up.\\n\"Yours,\\n\"TWOPENCE.\"\\nTommy raised a shout for Albert before he had even finished\\nperusing this characteristic epistle.\\n\"Pack my bag! We\\'re off!\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\" The boots of Albert could be heard racing upstairs.\\nHolyhead? Did that mean that, after all----Tommy was puzzled. He\\nread on slowly.\\nThe boots of Albert continued to be active on the floor above.\\nSuddenly a second shout came from below.\\n\"Albert! I\\'m a damned fool! Unpack that bag!\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\nTommy smoothed out the note thoughtfully.\\n\"Yes, a damned fool,\" he said softly. \"But so\\'s some one else!\\nAnd at last I know who it is!\"\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\nJULIUS TAKES A HAND\\nIN his suite at Claridge\\'s, Kramenin reclined on a couch and\\ndictated to his secretary in sibilant Russian.\\nPresently the telephone at the secretary\\'s elbow purred, and he\\ntook up the receiver, spoke for a minute or two, then turned to\\nhis employer.\\n\"Some one below is asking for you.\"\\n\"Who is it?\"\\n\"He gives the name of Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer.\"\\n\"Hersheimmer,\" repeated Kramenin thoughtfully. \"I have heard\\nthat name before.\"\\n\"His father was one of the steel kings of America,\" explained the\\nsecretary, whose business it was to know everything. \"This young\\nman must be a millionaire several times over.\"\\nThe other\\'s eyes narrowed appreciatively.\\n\"You had better go down and see him, Ivan. Find out what he\\nwants.\"\\nThe secretary obeyed, closing the door noiselessly behind him. In\\na few minutes he returned.\\n\"He declines to state his business--says it is entirely private\\nand personal, and that he must see you.\"\\n\"A millionaire several times over,\" murmured Kramenin. \"Bring\\nhim up, my dear Ivan.\"\\nThe secretary left the room once more, and returned escorting\\nJulius.\\n\"Monsieur Kramenin?\" said the latter abruptly.\\nThe Russian, studying him attentively with his pale venomous\\neyes, bowed.\\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" said the American. \"I\\'ve got some very\\nimportant business I\\'d like to talk over with you, if I can see\\nyou alone.\" He looked pointedly at the other.\\n\"My secretary, Monsieur Grieber, from whom I have no secrets.\"\\n\"That may be so--but I have,\" said Julius dryly. \"So I\\'d be\\nobliged if you\\'d tell him to scoot.\"\\n\"Ivan,\" said the Russian softly, \"perhaps you would not mind\\nretiring into the next room----\"\\n\"The next room won\\'t do,\" interrupted Julius. \"I know these\\nducal suites--and I want this one plumb empty except for you and\\nme. Send him round to a store to buy a penn\\'orth of peanuts.\"\\nThough not particularly enjoying the American\\'s free and easy\\nmanner of speech, Kramenin was devoured by curiosity. \"Will your\\nbusiness take long to state?\"\\n\"Might be an all night job if you caught on.\"\\n\"Very good, Ivan. I shall not require you again this evening. Go\\nto the theatre--take a night off.\"\\n\"Thank you, your excellency.\"\\nThe secretary bowed and departed.\\nJulius stood at the door watching his retreat. Finally, with a\\nsatisfied sigh, he closed it, and came back to his position in\\nthe centre of the room.\\n\"Now, Mr. Hersheimmer, perhaps you will be so kind as to come to\\nthe point?\"\\n\"I guess that won\\'t take a minute,\" drawled Julius. Then, with\\nan abrupt change of manner: \"Hands up--or I shoot!\"\\nFor a moment Kramenin stared blindly into the big automatic,\\nthen, with almost comical haste, he flung up his hands above his\\nhead. In that instant Julius had taken his measure. The man he\\nhad to deal with was an abject physical coward--the rest would be\\neasy.\\n\"This is an outrage,\" cried the Russian in a high hysterical\\nvoice. \"An outrage! Do you mean to kill me?\"\\n\"Not if you keep your voice down. Don\\'t go edging sideways\\ntowards that bell. That\\'s better.\"\\n\"What do you want? Do nothing rashly. Remember my life is of\\nthe utmost value to my country. I may have been maligned----\"\\n\"I reckon,\" said Julius, \"that the man who let daylight into you\\nwould be doing humanity a good turn. But you needn\\'t worry any.\\nI\\'m not proposing to kill you this trip--that is, if you\\'re\\nreasonable.\"\\nThe Russian quailed before the stern menace in the other\\'s eyes.\\nHe passed his tongue over his dry lips.\\n\"What do you want? Money?\"\\n\"No. I want Jane Finn.\"\\n\"Jane Finn? I--never heard of her!\"\\n\"You\\'re a darned liar! You know perfectly who I mean.\"\\n\"I tell you I\\'ve never heard of the girl.\"\\n\"And I tell you,\" retorted Julius, \"that Little Willie here is\\njust hopping mad to go off!\"\\nThe Russian wilted visibly.\\n\"You wouldn\\'t dare----\"\\n\"Oh, yes, I would, son!\"\\nKramenin must have recognized something in the voice that carried\\nconviction, for he said sullenly:\\n\"Well? Granted I do know who you mean--what of it?\"\\n\"You will tell me now--right here--where she is to be found.\"\\nKramenin shook his head.\\n\"I daren\\'t.\"\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\"I daren\\'t. You ask an impossibility.\"\\n\"Afraid, eh? Of whom? Mr. Brown? Ah, that tickles you up!\\nThere is such a person, then? I doubted it. And the mere\\nmention of him scares you stiff!\"\\n\"I have seen him,\" said the Russian slowly. \"Spoken to him face\\nto face. I did not know it until afterwards. He was one of a\\ncrowd. I should not know him again. Who is he really? I do not\\nknow. But I know this--he is a man to fear.\"\\n\"He\\'ll never know,\" said Julius.\\n\"He knows everything--and his vengeance is swift. Even\\nI--Kramenin!--would not be exempt!\"\\n\"Then you won\\'t do as I ask you?\"\\n\"You ask an impossibility.\"\\n\"Sure that\\'s a pity for you,\" said Julius cheerfully. \"But the\\nworld in general will benefit.\" He raised the revolver.\\n\"Stop,\" shrieked the Russian. \"You cannot mean to shoot me?\"\\n\"Of course I do. I\\'ve always heard you Revolutionists held life\\ncheap, but it seems there\\'s a difference when it\\'s your own life\\nin question. I gave you just one chance of saving your dirty\\nskin, and that you wouldn\\'t take!\"\\n\"They would kill me!\"\\n\"Well,\" said Julius pleasantly, \"it\\'s up to you. But I\\'ll just\\nsay this. Little Willie here is a dead cert, and if I was you I\\'d\\ntake a sporting chance with Mr. Brown!\"\\n\"You will hang if you shoot me,\" muttered the Russian\\nirresolutely.\\n\"No, stranger, that\\'s where you\\'re wrong. You forget the\\ndollars. A big crowd of solicitors will get busy, and they\\'ll get\\nsome high-brow doctors on the job, and the end of it all will be\\nthat they\\'ll say my brain was unhinged. I shall spend a few\\nmonths in a quiet sanatorium, my mental health will improve, the\\ndoctors will declare me sane again, and all will end happily for\\nlittle Julius. I guess I can bear a few months\\' retirement in\\norder to rid the world of you, but don\\'t you kid yourself I\\'ll\\nhang for it!\"\\nThe Russian believed him. Corrupt himself, he believed\\nimplicitly in the power of money. He had read of American murder\\ntrials running much on the lines indicated by Julius. He had\\nbought and sold justice himself. This virile young American, with\\nthe significant drawling voice, had the whip hand of him.\\n\"I\\'m going to count five,\" continued Julius, \"and I guess, if you\\nlet me get past four, you needn\\'t worry any about Mr. Brown.\\nMaybe he\\'ll send some flowers to the funeral, but YOU won\\'t smell\\nthem! Are you ready? I\\'ll begin. One--two three--four----\"\\nThe Russian interrupted with a shriek:\\n\"Do not shoot. I will do all you wish.\"\\nJulius lowered the revolver.\\n\"I thought you\\'d hear sense. Where is the girl?\"\\n\"At Gatehouse, in Kent. Astley Priors, the place is called.\"\\n\"Is she a prisoner there?\"\\n\"She\\'s not allowed to leave the house--though it\\'s safe enough\\nreally. The little fool has lost her memory, curse her!\"\\n\"That\\'s been annoying for you and your friends, I reckon. What\\nabout the other girl, the one you decoyed away over a week ago?\"\\n\"She\\'s there too,\" said the Russian sullenly.\\n\"That\\'s good,\" said Julius. \"Isn\\'t it all panning out\\nbeautifully? And a lovely night for the run!\"\\n\"What run?\" demanded Kramenin, with a stare.\\n\"Down to Gatehouse, sure. I hope you\\'re fond of motoring?\"\\n\"What do you mean? I refuse to go.\"\\n\"Now don\\'t get mad. You must see I\\'m not such a kid as to leave\\nyou here. You\\'d ring up your friends on that telephone first\\nthing! Ah!\" He observed the fall on the other\\'s face. \"You\\nsee, you\\'d got it all fixed. No, sir, you\\'re coming along with\\nme. This your bedroom next door here? Walk right in. Little\\nWillie and I will come behind. Put on a thick coat, that\\'s\\nright. Fur lined? And you a Socialist! Now we\\'re ready. We\\nwalk downstairs and out through the hall to where my car\\'s\\nwaiting. And don\\'t you forget I\\'ve got you covered every inch of\\nthe way. I can shoot just as well through my coat pocket. One\\nword, or a glance even, at one of those liveried menials, and\\nthere\\'ll sure be a strange face in the Sulphur and Brimstone\\nWorks!\"\\nTogether they descended the stairs, and passed out to the waiting\\ncar. The Russian was shaking with rage. The hotel servants\\nsurrounded them. A cry hovered on his lips, but at the last\\nminute his nerve failed him. The American was a man of his word.\\nWhen they reached the car, Julius breathed a sigh of relief. The\\ndanger-zone was passed. Fear had successfully hypnotized the man\\nby his side.\\n\"Get in,\" he ordered. Then as he caught the other\\'s sidelong\\nglance, \"No, the chauffeur won\\'t help you any. Naval man. Was on\\na submarine in Russia when the Revolution broke out. A brother of\\nhis was murdered by your people. George!\"\\n\"Yes, sir?\" The chauffeur turned his head.\\n\"This gentleman is a Russian Bolshevik. We don\\'t want to shoot\\nhim, but it may be necessary. You understand?\"\\n\"Perfectly, sir.\"\\n\"I want to go to Gatehouse in Kent. Know the road at all?\"\\n\"Yes, sir, it will be about an hour and a half\\'s run.\"\\n\"Make it an hour. I\\'m in a hurry.\"\\n\"I\\'ll do my best, sir.\" The car shot forward through the\\ntraffic.\\nJulius ensconced himself comfortably by the side of his victim.\\nHe kept his hand in the pocket of his coat, but his manner was\\nurbane to the last degree.\\n\"There was a man I shot once in Arizona----\" he began cheerfully.\\nAt the end of the hour\\'s run the unfortunate Kramenin was more\\ndead than alive. In succession to the anecdote of the Arizona\\nman, there had been a tough from \\'Frisco, and an episode in the\\nRockies. Julius\\'s narrative style, if not strictly accurate, was\\npicturesque!\\nSlowing down, the chauffeur called over his shoulder that they\\nwere just coming into Gatehouse. Julius bade the Russian direct\\nthem. His plan was to drive straight up to the house. There\\nKramenin was to ask for the two girls. Julius explained to him\\nthat Little Willie would not be tolerant of failure. Kramenin, by\\nthis time, was as putty in the other\\'s hands. The terrific pace\\nthey had come had still further unmanned him. He had given\\nhimself up for dead at every corner.\\nThe car swept up the drive, and stopped before the porch. The\\nchauffeur looked round for orders.\\n\"Turn the car first, George. Then ring the bell, and get back to\\nyour place. Keep the engine going, and be ready to scoot like\\nhell when I give the word.\"\\n\"Very good, sir.\"\\nThe front door was opened by the butler. Kramenin felt the\\nmuzzle of the revolver pressed against his ribs.\\n\"Now,\" hissed Julius. \"And be careful.\"\\nThe Russian beckoned. His lips were white, and his voice was not\\nvery steady:\\n\"It is I--Kramenin! Bring down the girl at once! There is no\\ntime to lose!\"\\nWhittington had come down the steps. He uttered an exclamation\\nof astonishment at seeing the other.\\n\"You! What\\'s up? Surely you know the plan----\"\\nKramenin interrupted him, using the words that have created many\\nunnecessary panics:\\n\"We have been betrayed! Plans must be abandoned. We must save\\nour own skins. The girl! And at once! It\\'s our only chance.\"\\nWhittington hesitated, but for hardly a moment.\\n\"You have orders--from HIM?\"\\n\"Naturally! Should I be here otherwise? Hurry! There is no\\ntime to be lost. The other little fool had better come too.\"\\nWhittington turned and ran back into the house. The agonizing\\nminutes went by. Then--two figures hastily huddled in cloaks\\nappeared on the steps and were hustled into the car. The smaller\\nof the two was inclined to resist and Whittington shoved her in\\nunceremoniously. Julius leaned forward, and in doing so the\\nlight from the open door lit up his face. Another man on the\\nsteps behind Whittington gave a startled exclamation. Concealment\\nwas at an end.\\n\"Get a move on, George,\" shouted Julius.\\nThe chauffeur slipped in his clutch, and with a bound the car\\nstarted.\\nThe man on the steps uttered an oath. His hand went to his\\npocket. There was a flash and a report. The bullet just missed\\nthe taller girl by an inch.\\n\"Get down, Jane,\" cried Julius. \"Flat on the bottom of the car.\"\\nHe thrust her sharply forward, then standing up, he took careful\\naim and fired.\\n\"Have you hit him?\" cried Tuppence eagerly.\\n\"Sure,\" replied Julius. \"He isn\\'t killed, though. Skunks like\\nthat take a lot of killing. Are you all right, Tuppence?\"\\n\"Of course I am. Where\\'s Tommy? And who\\'s this?\" She indicated\\nthe shivering Kramenin.\\n\"Tommy\\'s making tracks for the Argentine. I guess he thought\\nyou\\'d turned up your toes. Steady through the gate, George!\\nThat\\'s right. It\\'ll take \\'em at least five minutes to get busy\\nafter us. They\\'ll use the telephone, I guess, so look out for\\nsnares ahead--and don\\'t take the direct route. Who\\'s this, did\\nyou say, Tuppence? Let me present Monsieur Kramenin. I\\npersuaded him to come on the trip for his health.\"\\nThe Russian remained mute, still livid with terror.\\n\"But what made them let us go?\" demanded Tuppence suspiciously.\\n\"I reckon Monsieur Kramenin here asked them so prettily they just\\ncouldn\\'t refuse!\"\\nThis was too much for the Russian. He burst out vehemently:\\n\"Curse you--curse you! They know now that I betrayed them. My\\nlife won\\'t be safe for an hour in this country.\"\\n\"That\\'s so,\" assented Julius. \"I\\'d advise you to make tracks for\\nRussia right away.\"\\n\"Let me go, then,\" cried the other. \"I have done what you asked.\\nWhy do you still keep me with you?\"\\n\"Not for the pleasure of your company. I guess you can get right\\noff now if you want to. I thought you\\'d rather I tooled you back\\nto London.\"\\n\"You may never reach London,\" snarled the other. \"Let me go here\\nand now.\"\\n\"Sure thing. Pull up, George. The gentleman\\'s not making the\\nreturn trip. If I ever come to Russia, Monsieur Kramenin, I shall\\nexpect a rousing welcome, and----\"\\nBut before Julius had finished his speech, and before the car had\\nfinally halted, the Russian had swung himself out and disappeared\\ninto the night.\\n\"Just a mite impatient to leave us,\" commented Julius, as the car\\ngathered way again. \"And no idea of saying good-bye politely to\\nthe ladies. Say, Jane, you can get up on the seat now.\"\\nFor the first time the girl spoke.\\n\"How did you \\'persuade\\' him?\" she asked.\\nJulius tapped his revolver.\\n\"Little Willie here takes the credit!\"\\n\"Splendid!\" cried the girl. The colour surged into her face, her\\neyes looked admiringly at Julius.\\n\"Annette and I didn\\'t know what was going to happen to us,\" said\\nTuppence. \"Old Whittington hurried us off. We thought it was\\nlambs to the slaughter.\"\\n\"Annette,\" said Julius. \"Is that what you call her?\"\\nHis mind seemed to be trying to adjust itself to a new idea.\\n\"It\\'s her name,\" said Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide.\\n\"Shucks!\" retorted Julius. \"She may think it\\'s her name, because\\nher memory\\'s gone, poor kid. But it\\'s the one real and original\\nJane Finn we\\'ve got here.\"\\n\"What?\" cried Tuppence.\\nBut she was interrupted. With an angry spurt, a bullet embedded\\nitself in the upholstery of the car just behind her head.\\n\"Down with you,\" cried Julius. \"It\\'s an ambush. These guys have\\ngot busy pretty quickly. Push her a bit, George.\"\\nThe car fairly leapt forward. Three more shots rang out, but\\nwent happily wide. Julius, upright, leant over the back of the\\ncar.\\n\"Nothing to shoot at,\" he announced gloomily. \"But I guess\\nthere\\'ll be another little picnic soon. Ah!\"\\nHe raised his hand to his cheek.\\n\"You are hurt?\" said Annette quickly.\\n\"Only a scratch.\"\\nThe girl sprang to her feet.\\n\"Let me out! Let me out, I say! Stop the car. It is me they\\'re\\nafter. I\\'m the one they want. You shall not lose your lives\\nbecause of me. Let me go.\" She was fumbling with the fastenings\\nof the door.\\nJulius took her by both arms, and looked at her. She had spoken\\nwith no trace of foreign accent.\\n\"Sit down, kid,\" he said gently. \"I guess there\\'s nothing wrong\\nwith your memory. Been fooling them all the time, eh?\"\\nThe girl looked at him, nodded, and then suddenly burst into\\ntears. Julius patted her on the shoulder.\\n\"There, there--just you sit tight. We\\'re not going to let you\\nquit.\"\\nThrough her sobs the girl said indistinctly:\\n\"You\\'re from home. I can tell by your voice. It makes me\\nhome-sick.\"\\n\"Sure I\\'m from home. I\\'m your cousin--Julius Hersheimmer. I\\ncame over to Europe on purpose to find you--and a pretty dance\\nyou\\'ve led me.\"\\nThe car slackened speed. George spoke over his shoulder:\\n\"Cross-roads here, sir. I\\'m not sure of the way.\"\\nThe car slowed down till it hardly moved. As it did so a figure\\nclimbed suddenly over the back, and plunged head first into the\\nmidst of them.\\n\"Sorry,\" said Tommy, extricating himself.\\nA mass of confused exclamations greeted him. He replied to them\\nseverally:\\n\"Was in the bushes by the drive. Hung on behind. Couldn\\'t let\\nyou know before at the pace you were going. It was all I could\\ndo to hang on. Now then, you girls, get out!\"\\n\"Get out?\"\\n\"Yes. There\\'s a station just up that road. Train due in three\\nminutes. You\\'ll catch it if you hurry.\"\\n\"What the devil are you driving at?\" demanded Julius. \"Do you\\nthink you can fool them by leaving the car?\"\\n\"You and I aren\\'t going to leave the car. Only the girls.\"\\n\"You\\'re crazed, Beresford. Stark staring mad! You can\\'t let\\nthose girls go off alone. It\\'ll be the end of it if you do.\"\\nTommy turned to Tuppence.\\n\"Get out at once, Tuppence. Take her with you, and do just as I\\nsay. No one will do you any harm. You\\'re safe. Take the train\\nto London. Go straight to Sir James Peel Edgerton. Mr. Carter\\nlives out of town, but you\\'ll be safe with him.\"\\n\"Darn you!\" cried Julius. \"You\\'re mad. Jane, you stay where you\\nare.\"\\nWith a sudden swift movement, Tommy snatched the revolver from\\nJulius\\'s hand, and levelled it at him.\\n\"Now will you believe I\\'m in earnest? Get out, both of you, and\\ndo as I say--or I\\'ll shoot!\"\\nTuppence sprang out, dragging the unwilling Jane after her.\\n\"Come on, it\\'s all right. If Tommy\\'s sure--he\\'s sure. Be quick.\\nWe\\'ll miss the train.\"\\nThey started running.\\nJulius\\'s pent-up rage burst forth.\\n\"What the hell----\"\\nTommy interrupted him.\\n\"Dry up! I want a few words with you, Mr. Julius Hersheimmer.\"\\nCHAPTER\\nXXV\\nJANE\\'S STORY\\nHER arm through Jane\\'s, dragging her along, Tuppence reached the\\nstation. Her quick ears caught the sound of the approaching\\ntrain.\\n\"Hurry up,\" she panted, \"or we\\'ll miss it.\"\\nThey arrived on the platform just as the train came to a\\nstandstill. Tuppence opened the door of an empty first-class\\ncompartment, and the two girls sank down breathless on the padded\\nseats.\\nA man looked in, then passed on to the next carriage. Jane\\nstarted nervously. Her eyes dilated with terror. She looked\\nquestioningly at Tuppence.\\n\"Is he one of them, do you think?\" she breathed.\\nTuppence shook her head.\\n\"No, no. It\\'s all right.\" She took Jane\\'s hand in hers. \"Tommy\\nwouldn\\'t have told us to do this unless he was sure we\\'d be all\\nright.\"\\n\"But he doesn\\'t know them as I do!\" The girl shivered. \"You\\ncan\\'t understand. Five years! Five long years! Sometimes I\\nthought I should go mad.\"\\n\"Never mind. It\\'s all over.\"\\n\"Is it?\"\\nThe train was moving now, speeding through the night at a\\ngradually increasing rate. Suddenly Jane Finn started up.\\n\"What was that? I thought I saw a face--looking in through the\\nwindow.\"\\n\"No, there\\'s nothing. See.\" Tuppence went to the window, and\\nlifting the strap let the pane down.\\n\"You\\'re sure?\"\\n\"Quite sure.\"\\nThe other seemed to feel some excuse was necessary:\\n\"I guess I\\'m acting like a frightened rabbit, but I can\\'t help\\nit. If they caught me now they\\'d----\" Her eyes opened wide and\\nstaring.\\n\"DON\\'T!\" implored Tuppence. \"Lie back, and DON\\'T THINK. You can\\nbe quite sure that Tommy wouldn\\'t have said it was safe if it\\nwasn\\'t.\"\\n\"My cousin didn\\'t think so. He didn\\'t want us to do this.\"\\n\"No,\" said Tuppence, rather embarrassed.\\n\"What are you thinking of?\" said Jane sharply.\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Your voice was so--queer!\"\\n\"I WAS thinking of something,\" confessed Tuppence. \"But I don\\'t\\nwant to tell you--not now. I may be wrong, but I don\\'t think so.\\nIt\\'s just an idea that came into my head a long time ago. Tommy\\'s\\ngot it too--I\\'m almost sure he has. But don\\'t YOU\\nworry--there\\'ll be time enough for that later. And it mayn\\'t be\\nso at all! Do what I tell you--lie back and don\\'t think of\\nanything.\"\\n\"I\\'ll try.\" The long lashes drooped over the hazel eyes.\\nTuppence, for her part, sat bolt upright--much in the attitude of\\na watchful terrier on guard. In spite of herself she was\\nnervous. Her eyes flashed continually from one window to the\\nother. She noted the exact position of the communication cord.\\nWhat it was that she feared, she would have been hard put to it\\nto say. But in her own mind she was far from feeling the\\nconfidence displayed in her words. Not that she disbelieved in\\nTommy, but occasionally she was shaken with doubts as to whether\\nanyone so simple and honest as he was could ever be a match for\\nthe fiendish subtlety of the arch-criminal.\\nIf they once reached Sir James Peel Edgerton in safety, all would\\nbe well. But would they reach him? Would not the silent forces\\nof Mr. Brown already be assembling against them? Even that last\\npicture of Tommy, revolver in hand, failed to comfort her. By\\nnow he might be overpowered, borne down by sheer force of\\nnumbers.... Tuppence mapped out her plan of campaign.\\nAs the train at length drew slowly into Charing Cross, Jane Finn\\nsat up with a start.\\n\"Have we arrived? I never thought we should!\"\\n\"Oh, I thought we\\'d get to London all right. If there\\'s going to\\nbe any fun, now is when it will begin. Quick, get out. We\\'ll nip\\ninto a taxi.\"\\nIn another minute they were passing the barrier, had paid the\\nnecessary fares, and were stepping into a taxi.\\n\"King\\'s Cross,\" directed Tuppence. Then she gave a jump. A man\\nlooked in at the window, just as they started. She was almost\\ncertain it was the same man who had got into the carriage next to\\nthem. She had a horrible feeling of being slowly hemmed in on\\nevery side.\\n\"You see,\" she explained to Jane, \"if they think we\\'re going to\\nSir James, this will put them off the scent. Now they\\'ll imagine\\nwe\\'re going to Mr. Carter. His country place is north of London\\nsomewhere.\"\\nCrossing Holborn there was a block, and the taxi was held up.\\nThis was what Tuppence had been waiting for.\\n\"Quick,\" she whispered. \"Open the right-hand door!\"\\nThe two girls stepped out into the traffic. Two minutes later\\nthey were seated in another taxi and were retracing their steps,\\nthis time direct to Carlton House Terrace.\\n\"There,\" said Tuppence, with great satisfaction, \"this ought to\\ndo them. I can\\'t help thinking that I\\'m really rather clever!\\nHow that other taxi man will swear! But I took his number, and\\nI\\'ll send him a postal order to-morrow, so that he won\\'t lose by\\nit if he happens to be genuine. What\\'s this thing\\nswerving----Oh!\"\\nThere was a grinding noise and a bump. Another taxi had collided\\nwith them.\\nIn a flash Tuppence was out on the pavement. A policeman was\\napproaching. Before he arrived Tuppence had handed the driver\\nfive shillings, and she and Jane had merged themselves in the\\ncrowd.\\n\"It\\'s only a step or two now,\" said Tuppence breathlessly. The\\naccident had taken place in Trafalgar Square.\\n\"Do you think the collision was an accident, or done\\ndeliberately?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know. It might have been either.\"\\nHand-in-hand, the two girls hurried along.\\n\"It may be my fancy,\" said Tuppence suddenly, \"but I feel as\\nthough there was some one behind us.\"\\n\"Hurry!\" murmured the other. \"Oh, hurry!\"\\nThey were now at the corner of Carlton House Terrace, and their\\nspirits lightened. Suddenly a large and apparently intoxicated\\nman barred their way.\\n\"Good evening, ladies,\" he hiccupped. \"Whither away so fast?\"\\n\"Let us pass, please,\" said Tuppence imperiously.\\n\"Just a word with your pretty friend here.\" He stretched out an\\nunsteady hand, and clutched Jane by the shoulder. Tuppence heard\\nother footsteps behind. She did not pause to ascertain whether\\nthey were friends or foes. Lowering her head, she repeated a\\nmanoeuvre of childish days, and butted their aggressor full in\\nthe capacious middle. The success of these unsportsmanlike\\ntactics was immediate. The man sat down abruptly on the pavement.\\nTuppence and Jane took to their heels. The house they sought was\\nsome way down. Other footsteps echoed behind them. Their breath\\nwas coming in choking gasps as they reached Sir James\\'s door.\\nTuppence seized the bell and Jane the knocker.\\nThe man who had stopped them reached the foot of the steps. For a\\nmoment he hesitated, and as he did so the door opened. They fell\\ninto the hall together. Sir James came forward from the library\\ndoor.\\n\"Hullo! What\\'s this?\"\\nHe stepped forward, and put his arm round Jane as she swayed\\nuncertainly. He half carried her into the library, and laid her\\non the leather couch. From a tantalus on the table he poured out\\na few drops of brandy, and forced her to drink them. With a sigh\\nshe sat up, her eyes still wild and frightened.\\n\"It\\'s all right. Don\\'t be afraid, my child. You\\'re quite safe.\"\\nHer breath came more normally, and the colour was returning to\\nher cheeks. Sir James looked at Tuppence quizzically.\\n\"So you\\'re not dead, Miss Tuppence, any more than that Tommy boy\\nof yours was!\"\\n\"The Young Adventurers take a lot of killing,\" boasted Tuppence.\\n\"So it seems,\" said Sir James dryly. \"Am I right in thinking\\nthat the joint venture has ended in success, and that this\"--he\\nturned to the girl on the couch--\"is Miss Jane Finn?\"\\nJane sat up.\\n\"Yes,\" she said quietly, \"I am Jane Finn. I have a lot to tell\\nyou.\"\\n\"When you are stronger----\"\\n\"No--now!\" Her voice rose a little. \"I shall feel safer when I\\nhave told everything.\"\\n\"As you please,\" said the lawyer.\\nHe sat down in one of the big arm-chairs facing the couch. In a\\nlow voice Jane began her story.\\n\"I came over on the Lusitania to take up a post in Paris. I was\\nfearfully keen about the war, and just dying to help somehow or\\nother. I had been studying French, and my teacher said they were\\nwanting help in a hospital in Paris, so I wrote and offered my\\nservices, and they were accepted. I hadn\\'t got any folk of my\\nown, so it made it easy to arrange things.\\n\"When the Lusitania was torpedoed, a man came up to me. I\\'d\\nnoticed him more than once--and I\\'d figured it out in my own mind\\nthat he was afraid of somebody or something. He asked me if I\\nwas a patriotic American, and told me he was carrying papers\\nwhich were just life or death to the Allies. He asked me to take\\ncharge of them. I was to watch for an advertisement in the Times.\\nIf it didn\\'t appear, I was to take them to the American\\nAmbassador.\\n\"Most of what followed seems like a nightmare still. I see it in\\nmy dreams sometimes.... I\\'ll hurry over that part. Mr. Danvers\\nhad told me to watch out. He might have been shadowed from New\\nYork, but he didn\\'t think so. At first I had no suspicions, but\\non the boat to Holyhead I began to get uneasy. There was one\\nwoman who had been very keen to look after me, and chum up with\\nme generally--a Mrs. Vandemeyer. At first I\\'d been only grateful\\nto her for being so kind to me; but all the time I felt there was\\nsomething about her I didn\\'t like, and on the Irish boat I saw\\nher talking to some queer-looking men, and from the way they\\nlooked I saw that they were talking about me. I remembered that\\nshe\\'d been quite near me on the Lusitania when Mr. Danvers gave\\nme the packet, and before that she\\'d tried to talk to him once or\\ntwice. I began to get scared, but I didn\\'t quite see what to do.\\n\"I had a wild idea of stopping at Holyhead, and not going on to\\nLondon that day, but I soon saw that that would be plumb\\nfoolishness. The only thing was to act as though I\\'d noticed\\nnothing, and hope for the best. I couldn\\'t see how they could\\nget me if I was on my guard. One thing I\\'d done already as a\\nprecaution--ripped open the oilskin packet and substituted blank\\npaper, and then sewn it up again. So, if anyone did manage to rob\\nme of it, it wouldn\\'t matter.\\n\"What to do with the real thing worried me no end. Finally I\\nopened it out flat--there were only two sheets--and laid it\\nbetween two of the advertisement pages of a magazine. I stuck the\\ntwo pages together round the edge with some gum off an envelope.\\nI carried the magazine carelessly stuffed into the pocket of my\\nulster.\\n\"At Holyhead I tried to get into a carriage with people that\\nlooked all right, but in a queer way there seemed always to be a\\ncrowd round me shoving and pushing me just the way I didn\\'t want\\nto go. There was something uncanny and frightening about it. In\\nthe end I found myself in a carriage with Mrs. Vandemeyer after\\nall. I went out into the corridor, but all the other carriages\\nwere full, so I had to go back and sit down. I consoled myself\\nwith the thought that there were other people in the\\ncarriage--there was quite a nice-looking man and his wife sitting\\njust opposite. So I felt almost happy about it until just outside\\nLondon. I had leaned back and closed my eyes. I guess they\\nthought I was asleep, but my eyes weren\\'t quite shut, and\\nsuddenly I saw the nice-looking man get something out of his bag\\nand hand it to Mrs. Vandemeyer, and as he did so he WINKED....\\n\"I can\\'t tell you how that wink sort of froze me through and\\nthrough. My only thought was to get out in the corridor as quick\\nas ever I could. I got up, trying to look natural and easy.\\nPerhaps they saw something--I don\\'t know--but suddenly Mrs.\\nVandemeyer said \\'Now,\\' and flung something over my nose and mouth\\nas I tried to scream. At the same moment I felt a terrific blow\\non the back of my head....\"\\nShe shuddered. Sir James murmured something sympathetically. In\\na minute she resumed:\\n\"I don\\'t know how long it was before I came back to\\nconsciousness. I felt very ill and sick. I was lying on a dirty\\nbed. There was a screen round it, but I could hear two people\\ntalking in the room. Mrs. Vandemeyer was one of them. I tried to\\nlisten, but at first I couldn\\'t take much in. When at last I did\\nbegin to grasp what was going on--I was just terrified! I wonder\\nI didn\\'t scream right out there and then.\\n\"They hadn\\'t found the papers. They\\'d got the oilskin packet\\nwith the blanks, and they were just mad! They didn\\'t know\\nwhether I\\'d changed the papers, or whether Danvers had been\\ncarrying a dummy message, while the real one was sent another\\nway. They spoke of\"--she closed her eyes--\"torturing me to find\\nout!\\n\"I\\'d never known what fear--really sickening fear--was before!\\nOnce they came to look at me. I shut my eyes and pretended to be\\nstill unconscious, but I was afraid they\\'d hear the beating of my\\nheart. However, they went away again. I began thinking madly.\\nWhat could I do? I knew I wouldn\\'t be able to stand up against\\ntorture very long.\\n\"Suddenly something put the thought of loss of memory into my\\nhead. The subject had always interested me, and I\\'d read an awful\\nlot about it. I had the whole thing at my finger-tips. If only I\\ncould succeed in carrying the bluff through, it might save me. I\\nsaid a prayer, and drew a long breath. Then I opened my eyes and\\nstarted babbling in FRENCH!\\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer came round the screen at once. Her face was so\\nwicked I nearly died, but I smiled up at her doubtfully, and\\nasked her in French where I was.\\n\"It puzzled her, I could see. She called the man she had been\\ntalking to. He stood by the screen with his face in shadow. He\\nspoke to me in French. His voice was very ordinary and quiet,\\nbut somehow, I don\\'t know why, he scared me worse than the woman.\\nI felt he\\'d seen right through me, but I went on playing my part.\\nI asked again where I was, and then went on that there was\\nsomething I MUST remember--MUST remember--only for the moment it\\nwas all gone. I worked myself up to be more and more distressed.\\nHe asked me my name. I said I didn\\'t know--that I couldn\\'t\\nremember anything at all.\\n\"Suddenly he caught my wrist, and began twisting it. The pain\\nwas awful. I screamed. He went on. I screamed and screamed, but\\nI managed to shriek out things in French. I don\\'t know how long\\nI could have gone on, but luckily I fainted. The last thing I\\nheard was his voice saying: \\'That\\'s not bluff! Anyway, a kid of\\nher age wouldn\\'t know enough.\\' I guess he forgot American girls\\nare older for their age than English ones, and take more interest\\nin scientific subjects.\\n\"When I came to, Mrs. Vandemeyer was sweet as honey to me. She\\'d\\nhad her orders, I guess. She spoke to me in French--told me I\\'d\\nhad a shock and been very ill. I should be better soon. I\\npretended to be rather dazed--murmured something about the\\n\\'doctor\\' having hurt my wrist. She looked relieved when I said\\nthat.\\n\"By and by she went out of the room altogether. I was suspicious\\nstill, and lay quite quiet for some time. In the end, however, I\\ngot up and walked round the room, examining it. I thought that\\neven if anyone WAS watching me from somewhere, it would seem\\nnatural enough under the circumstances. It was a squalid, dirty\\nplace. There were no windows, which seemed queer. I guessed the\\ndoor would be locked, but I didn\\'t try it. There were some\\nbattered old pictures on the walls, representing scenes from\\nFaust.\"\\nJane\\'s two listeners gave a simultaneous \"Ah!\" The girl nodded.\\n\"Yes--it was the place in Soho where Mr. Beresford was\\nimprisoned. Of course, at the time I didn\\'t even know if I was in\\nLondon. One thing was worrying me dreadfully, but my heart gave\\na great throb of relief when I saw my ulster lying carelessly\\nover the back of a chair. AND THE MAGAZINE WAS STILL ROLLED UP IN\\nTHE POCKET!\\n\"If only I could be certain that I was not being overlooked! I\\nlooked carefully round the walls. There didn\\'t seem to be a\\npeep-hole of any kind--nevertheless I felt kind of sure there\\nmust be. All of a sudden I sat down on the edge of the table, and\\nput my face in my hands, sobbing out a \\'Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!\\'\\nI\\'ve got very sharp ears. I distinctly heard the rustle of a\\ndress, and slight creak. That was enough for me. I was being\\nwatched!\\n\"I lay down on the bed again, and by and by Mrs. Vandemeyer\\nbrought me some supper. She was still sweet as they make them. I\\nguess she\\'d been told to win my confidence. Presently she\\nproduced the oilskin packet, and asked me if I recognized it,\\nwatching me like a lynx all the time.\\n\"I took it and turned it over in a puzzled sort of way. Then I\\nshook my head. I said that I felt I OUGHT to remember something\\nabout it, that it was just as though it was all coming back, and\\nthen, before I could get hold of it, it went again. Then she told\\nme that I was her niece, and that I was to call her \\'Aunt Rita.\\'\\nI did obediently, and she told me not to worry--my memory would\\nsoon come back.\\n\"That was an awful night. I\\'d made my plan whilst I was waiting\\nfor her. The papers were safe so far, but I couldn\\'t take the\\nrisk of leaving them there any longer. They might throw that\\nmagazine away any minute. I lay awake waiting until I judged it\\nmust be about two o\\'clock in the morning. Then I got up as\\nsoftly as I could, and felt in the dark along the left-hand wall.\\nVery gently, I unhooked one of the pictures from its\\nnail--Marguerite with her casket of jewels. I crept over to my\\ncoat and took out the magazine, and an odd envelope or two that I\\nhad shoved in. Then I went to the washstand, and damped the\\nbrown paper at the back of the picture all round. Presently I was\\nable to pull it away. I had already torn out the two\\nstuck-together pages from the magazine, and now I slipped them\\nwith their precious enclosure between the picture and its brown\\npaper backing. A little gum from the envelopes helped me to stick\\nthe latter up again. No one would dream the picture had ever been\\ntampered with. I rehung it on the wall, put the magazine back in\\nmy coat pocket, and crept back to bed. I was pleased with my\\nhiding-place. They\\'d never think of pulling to pieces one of\\ntheir own pictures. I hoped that they\\'d come to the conclusion\\nthat Danvers had been carrying a dummy all along, and that, in\\nthe end, they\\'d let me go.\\n\"As a matter of fact, I guess that\\'s what they did think at\\nfirst, and, in a way, it was dangerous for me. I learnt\\nafterwards that they nearly did away with me then and\\nthere--there was never much chance of their \\'letting me go\\'--but\\nthe first man, who was the boss, preferred to keep me alive on\\nthe chance of my having hidden them, and being able to tell where\\nif I recovered my memory. They watched me constantly for weeks.\\nSometimes they\\'d ask me questions by the hour--I guess there was\\nnothing they didn\\'t know about the third degree!--but somehow I\\nmanaged to hold my own. The strain of it was awful, though . . .\\n\"They took me back to Ireland, and over every step of the Journey\\nagain, in case I\\'d hidden it somewhere en route. Mrs. Vandemeyer\\nand another woman never left me for a moment. They spoke of me as\\na young relative of Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s whose mind was affected by\\nthe shock of the Lusitania. There was no one I could appeal to\\nfor help without giving myself away to THEM, and if I risked it\\nand failed--and Mrs. Vandemeyer looked so rich, and so\\nbeautifully dressed, that I felt convinced they\\'d take her word\\nagainst mine, and think it was part of my mental trouble to think\\nmyself \\'persecuted\\'--I felt that the horrors in store for me\\nwould be too awful once they knew I\\'d been only shamming.\"\\nSir James nodded comprehendingly.\\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer was a woman of great personality. With that and\\nher social position she would have had little difficulty in\\nimposing her point of view in preference to yours. Your\\nsensational accusations against her would not easily have found\\ncredence.\"\\n\"That\\'s what I thought. It ended in my being sent to a\\nsanatorium at Bournemouth. I couldn\\'t make up my mind at first\\nwhether it was a sham affair or genuine. A hospital nurse had\\ncharge of me. I was a special patient. She seemed so nice and\\nnormal that at last I determined to confide in her. A merciful\\nprovidence just saved me in time from falling into the trap. My\\ndoor happened to be ajar, and I heard her talking to some one in\\nthe passage. SHE WAS ONE OF THEM! They still fancied it might be\\na bluff on my part, and she was put in charge of me to make sure!\\nAfter that, my nerve went completely. I dared trust nobody.\\n\"I think I almost hypnotized myself. After a while, I almost\\nforgot that I was really Jane Finn. I was so bent on playing the\\npart of Janet Vandemeyer that my nerves began to play me tricks.\\nI became really ill--for months I sank into a sort of stupor. I\\nfelt sure I should die soon, and that nothing really mattered. A\\nsane person shut up in a lunatic asylum often ends by becoming\\ninsane, they say. I guess I was like that. Playing my part had\\nbecome second nature to me. I wasn\\'t even unhappy in the\\nend--just apathetic. Nothing seemed to matter. And the years\\nwent on.\\n\"And then suddenly things seemed to change. Mrs. Vandemeyer came\\ndown from London. She and the doctor asked me questions,\\nexperimented with various treatments. There was some talk of\\nsending me to a specialist in Paris. In the end, they did not\\ndare risk it. I overheard something that seemed to show that\\nother people--friends--were looking for me. I learnt later that\\nthe nurse who had looked after me went to Paris, and consulted a\\nspecialist, representing herself to be me. He put her through\\nsome searching tests, and exposed her loss of memory to be\\nfraudulent; but she had taken a note of his methods and\\nreproduced them on me. I dare say I couldn\\'t have deceived the\\nspecialist for a minute--a man who has made a lifelong study of a\\nthing is unique--but I managed once again to hold my own with\\nthem. The fact that I\\'d not thought of myself as Jane Finn for so\\nlong made it easier.\\n\"One night I was whisked off to London at a moment\\'s notice. They\\ntook me back to the house in Soho. Once I got away from the\\nsanatorium I felt different--as though something in me that had\\nbeen buried for a long time was waking up again.\\n\"They sent me in to wait on Mr. Beresford. (Of course I didn\\'t\\nknow his name then.) I was suspicious--I thought it was another\\ntrap. But he looked so honest, I could hardly believe it.\\nHowever, I was careful in all I said, for I knew we could be\\noverheard. There\\'s a small hole, high up in the wall.\\n\"But on the Sunday afternoon a message was brought to the house.\\nThey were all very disturbed. Without their knowing, I listened.\\nWord had come that he was to be killed. I needn\\'t tell the next\\npart, because you know it. I thought I\\'d have time to rush up\\nand get the papers from their hiding-place, but I was caught. So\\nI screamed out that he was escaping, and I said I wanted to go\\nback to Marguerite. I shouted the name three times very loud. I\\nknew the others would think I meant Mrs. Vandemeyer, but I hoped\\nit might make Mr. Beresford think of the picture. He\\'d unhooked\\none the first day--that\\'s what made me hesitate to trust him.\"\\nShe paused.\\n\"Then the papers,\" said Sir James slowly, \"are still at the back\\nof the picture in that room.\"\\n\"Yes.\" The girl had sunk back on the sofa exhausted with the\\nstrain of the long story.\\nSir James rose to his feet. He looked at his watch.\\n\"Come,\" he said, \"we must go at once.\"\\n\"To-night?\" queried Tuppence, surprised.\\n\"To-morrow may be too late,\" said Sir James gravely. \"Besides, by\\ngoing to-night we have the chance of capturing that great man and\\nsuper-criminal--Mr. Brown!\"\\nThere was dead silence, and Sir James continued:\\n\"You have been followed here--not a doubt of it. When we leave\\nthe house we shall be followed again, but not molested, FOR IT IS\\nMR. BROWN\\'S PLAN THAT WE ARE TO LEAD HIM. But the Soho house is\\nunder police supervision night and day. There are several men\\nwatching it. When we enter that house, Mr. Brown will not draw\\nback--he will risk all, on the chance of obtaining the spark to\\nfire his mine. And he fancies the risk not great--since he will\\nenter in the guise of a friend!\"\\nTuppence flushed, then opened her mouth impulsively.\\n\"But there\\'s something you don\\'t know--that we haven\\'t told you.\"\\nHer eyes dwelt on Jane in perplexity.\\n\"What is that?\" asked the other sharply. \"No hesitations, Miss\\nTuppence. We need to be sure of our going.\"\\nBut Tuppence, for once, seemed tongue-tied.\\n\"It\\'s so difficult--you see, if I\\'m wrong--oh, it would be\\ndreadful.\" She made a grimace at the unconscious Jane. \"Never\\nforgive me,\" she observed cryptically.\\n\"You want me to help you out, eh?\"\\n\"Yes, please. YOU know who Mr. Brown is, don\\'t you?\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Sir James gravely. \"At last I do.\"\\n\"At last?\" queried Tuppence doubtfully. \"Oh, but I thought----\"\\nShe paused.\\n\"You thought correctly, Miss Tuppence. I have been morally\\ncertain of his identity for some time--ever since the night of\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s mysterious death.\"\\n\"Ah!\" breathed Tuppence.\\n\"For there we are up against the logic of facts. There are only\\ntwo solutions. Either the chloral was administered by her own\\nhand, which theory I reject utterly, or else----\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"Or else it was administered in the brandy you gave her. Only\\nthree people touched that brandy--you, Miss Tuppence, I myself,\\nand one other--Mr. Julius Hersheimmer!\"\\nJane Finn stirred and sat up, regarding the speaker with wide\\nastonished eyes.\\n\"At first, the thing seemed utterly impossible. Mr. Hersheimmer,\\nas the son of a prominent millionaire, was a well-known figure in\\nAmerica. It seemed utterly impossible that he and Mr. Brown\\ncould be one and the same. But you cannot escape from the logic\\nof facts. Since the thing was so--it must be accepted. Remember\\nMrs. Vandemeyer\\'s sudden and inexplicable agitation. Another\\nproof, if proof was needed.\\n\"I took an early opportunity of giving you a hint. From some\\nwords of Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s at Manchester, I gathered that you had\\nunderstood and acted on that hint. Then I set to work to prove\\nthe impossible possible. Mr. Beresford rang me up and told me,\\nwhat I had already suspected, that the photograph of Miss Jane\\nFinn had never really been out of Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s\\npossession----\"\\nBut the girl interrupted. Springing to her feet, she cried out\\nangrily:\\n\"What do you mean? What are you trying to suggest? That Mr.\\nBrown is JULIUS? Julius--my own cousin!\"\\n\"No, Miss Finn,\" said Sir James unexpectedly. \"Not your cousin.\\nThe man who calls himself Julius Hersheimmer is no relation to\\nyou whatsoever.\"\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\nMR. BROWN\\nSIR James\\'s words came like a bomb-shell. Both girls looked\\nequally puzzled. The lawyer went across to his desk, and returned\\nwith a small newspaper cutting, which he handed to Jane.\\nTuppence read it over her shoulder. Mr. Carter would have\\nrecognized it. It referred to the mysterious man found dead in\\nNew York.\\n\"As I was saying to Miss Tuppence,\" resumed the lawyer, \"I set to\\nwork to prove the impossible possible. The great stumbling-block\\nwas the undeniable fact that Julius Hersheimmer was not an\\nassumed name. When I came across this paragraph my problem was\\nsolved. Julius Hersheimmer set out to discover what had become of\\nhis cousin. He went out West, where he obtained news of her and\\nher photograph to aid him in his search. On the eve of his\\ndeparture from New York he was set upon and murdered. His body\\nwas dressed in shabby clothes, and the face disfigured to prevent\\nidentification. Mr. Brown took his place. He sailed immediately\\nfor England. None of the real Hersheimmer\\'s friends or intimates\\nsaw him before he sailed--though indeed it would hardly have\\nmattered if they had, the impersonation was so perfect. Since\\nthen he had been hand and glove with those sworn to hunt him\\ndown. Every secret of theirs has been known to him. Only once\\ndid he come near disaster. Mrs. Vandemeyer knew his secret. It\\nwas no part of his plan that that huge bribe should ever be\\noffered to her. But for Miss Tuppence\\'s fortunate change of\\nplan, she would have been far away from the flat when we arrived\\nthere. Exposure stared him in the face. He took a desperate\\nstep, trusting in his assumed character to avert suspicion. He\\nnearly succeeded--but not quite.\"\\n\"I can\\'t believe it,\" murmured Jane. \"He seemed so splendid.\"\\n\"The real Julius Hersheimmer WAS a splendid fellow! And Mr. Brown\\nis a consummate actor. But ask Miss Tuppence if she also has not\\nhad her suspicions.\"\\nJane turned mutely to Tuppence. The latter nodded.\\n\"I didn\\'t want to say it, Jane--I knew it would hurt you. And,\\nafter all, I couldn\\'t be sure. I still don\\'t understand why, if\\nhe\\'s Mr. Brown, he rescued us.\"\\n\"Was it Julius Hersheimmer who helped you to escape?\"\\nTuppence recounted to Sir James the exciting events of the\\nevening, ending up: \"But I can\\'t see WHY!\"\\n\"Can\\'t you? I can. So can young Beresford, by his actions. As a\\nlast hope Jane Finn was to be allowed to escape--and the escape\\nmust be managed so that she harbours no suspicions of its being a\\nput-up job. They\\'re not averse to young Beresford\\'s being in the\\nneighbourhood, and, if necessary, communicating with you. They\\'ll\\ntake care to get him out of the way at the right minute. Then\\nJulius Hersheimmer dashes up and rescues you in true melodramatic\\nstyle. Bullets fly--but don\\'t hit anybody. What would have\\nhappened next? You would have driven straight to the house in\\nSoho and secured the document which Miss Finn would probably have\\nentrusted to her cousin\\'s keeping. Or, if he conducted the\\nsearch, he would have pretended to find the hiding-place already\\nrifled. He would have had a dozen ways of dealing with the\\nsituation, but the result would have been the same. And I rather\\nfancy some accident would have happened to both of you. You see,\\nyou know rather an inconvenient amount. That\\'s a rough outline.\\nI admit I was caught napping; but somebody else wasn\\'t.\"\\n\"Tommy,\" said Tuppence softly.\\n\"Yes. Evidently when the right moment came to get rid of him--he\\nwas too sharp for them. All the same, I\\'m not too easy in my\\nmind about him.\"\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Because Julius Hersheimmer is Mr. Brown,\" said Sir James dryly.\\n\"And it takes more than one man and a revolver to hold up Mr.\\nBrown....\"\\nTuppence paled a little.\\n\"What can we do?\"\\n\"Nothing until we\\'ve been to the house in Soho. If Beresford has\\nstill got the upper hand, there\\'s nothing to fear. If otherwise,\\nour enemy will come to find us, and he will not find us\\nunprepared!\" From a drawer in the desk, he took a service\\nrevolver, and placed it in his coat pocket.\\n\"Now we\\'re ready. I know better than even to suggest going\\nwithout you, Miss Tuppence----\"\\n\"I should think so indeed!\"\\n\"But I do suggest that Miss Finn should remain here. She will be\\nperfectly safe, and I am afraid she is absolutely worn out with\\nall she has been through.\"\\nBut to Tuppence\\'s surprise Jane shook her head.\\n\"No. I guess I\\'m going too. Those papers were my trust. I must\\ngo through with this business to the end. I\\'m heaps better now\\nanyway.\"\\nSir James\\'s car was ordered round. During the short drive\\nTuppence\\'s heart beat tumultuously. In spite of momentary qualms\\nof uneasiness respecting Tommy, she could not but feel\\nexultation. They were going to win!\\nThe car drew up at the corner of the square and they got out. Sir\\nJames went up to a plain-clothes man who was on duty with several\\nothers, and spoke to him. Then he rejoined the girls.\\n\"No one has gone into the house so far. It is being watched at\\nthe back as well, so they are quite sure of that. Anyone who\\nattempts to enter after we have done so will be arrested\\nimmediately. Shall we go in?\"\\nA policeman produced a key. They all knew Sir James well. They\\nhad also had orders respecting Tuppence. Only the third member\\nof the party was unknown to them. The three entered the house,\\npulling the door to behind them. Slowly they mounted the rickety\\nstairs. At the top was the ragged curtain hiding the recess where\\nTommy had hidden that day. Tuppence had heard the story from\\nJane in her character of \"Annette.\" She looked at the tattered\\nvelvet with interest. Even now she could almost swear it\\nmoved--as though some one was behind it. So strong was the\\nillusion that she almost fancied she could make out the outline\\nof a form.... Supposing Mr. Brown--Julius--was there waiting....\\nImpossible of course! Yet she almost went back to put the\\ncurtain aside and make sure....\\nNow they were entering the prison room. No place for anyone to\\nhide here, thought Tuppence, with a sigh of relief, then chided\\nherself indignantly. She must not give way to this foolish\\nfancying--this curious insistent feeling that MR. BROWN WAS IN\\nTHE HOUSE.... Hark! what was that? A stealthy footstep on the\\nstairs? There WAS some one in the house! Absurd! She was\\nbecoming hysterical.\\nJane had gone straight to the picture of Marguerite. She\\nunhooked it with a steady hand. The dust lay thick upon it, and\\nfestoons of cobwebs lay between it and the wall. Sir James\\nhanded her a pocket-knife, and she ripped away the brown paper\\nfrom the back.... The advertisement page of a magazine fell out.\\nJane picked it up. Holding apart the frayed inner edges she\\nextracted two thin sheets covered with writing!\\nNo dummy this time! The real thing!\\n\"We\\'ve got it,\" said Tuppence. \"At last....\"\\nThe moment was almost breathless in its emotion. Forgotten the\\nfaint creakings, the imagined noises of a minute ago. None of\\nthem had eyes for anything but what Jane held in her hand.\\nSir James took it, and scrutinized it attentively.\\n\"Yes,\" he said quietly, \"this is the ill-fated draft treaty!\"\\n\"We\\'ve succeeded,\" said Tuppence. There was awe and an almost\\nwondering unbelief in her voice.\\nSir James echoed her words as he folded the paper carefully and\\nput it away in his pocket-book, then he looked curiously round\\nthe dingy room.\\n\"It was here that our young friend was confined for so long, was\\nit not?\" he said. \"A truly sinister room. You notice the\\nabsence of windows, and the thickness of the close-fitting door.\\nWhatever took place here would never be heard by the outside\\nworld.\"\\nTuppence shivered. His words woke a vague alarm in her. What if\\nthere WAS some one concealed in the house? Some one who might bar\\nthat door on them, and leave them to die like rats in a trap?\\nThen she realized the absurdity of her thought. The house was\\nsurrounded by police who, if they failed to reappear, would not\\nhesitate to break in and make a thorough search. She smiled at\\nher own foolishness--then looked up with a start to find Sir\\nJames watching her. He gave her an emphatic little nod.\\n\"Quite right, Miss Tuppence. You scent danger. So do I. So does\\nMiss Finn.\"\\n\"Yes,\" admitted Jane. \"It\\'s absurd--but I can\\'t help it.\"\\nSir James nodded again.\\n\"You feel--as we all feel--THE PRESENCE OF MR. BROWN. Yes\"--as\\nTuppence made a movement--\"not a doubt of it--MR. BROWN IS\\nHERE....\"\\n\"In this house?\"\\n\"In this room.... You don\\'t understand? I AM MR. BROWN....\"\\nStupefied, unbelieving, they stared at him. The very lines of\\nhis face had changed. It was a different man who stood before\\nthem. He smiled a slow cruel smile.\\n\"Neither of you will leave this room alive! You said just now we\\nhad succeeded. I have succeeded! The draft treaty is mine.\" His\\nsmile grew wider as he looked at Tuppence. \"Shall I tell you how\\nit will be? Sooner or later the police will break in, and they\\nwill find three victims of Mr. Brown--three, not two, you\\nunderstand, but fortunately the third will not be dead, only\\nwounded, and will be able to describe the attack with a wealth of\\ndetail! The treaty? It is in the hands of Mr. Brown. So no one\\nwill think of searching the pockets of Sir James Peel Edgerton!\"\\nHe turned to Jane.\\n\"You outwitted me. I make my acknowledgments. But you will not\\ndo it again.\"\\nThere was a faint sound behind him, but, intoxicated with\\nsuccess, he did not turn his head.\\nHe slipped his hand into his pocket.\\n\"Checkmate to the Young Adventurers,\" he said, and slowly raised\\nthe big automatic.\\nBut, even as he did so, he felt himself seized from behind in a\\ngrip of iron. The revolver was wrenched from his hand, and the\\nvoice of Julius Hersheimmer said drawlingly:\\n\"I guess you\\'re caught redhanded with the goods upon you.\"\\nThe blood rushed to the K.C.\\'s face, but his self-control was\\nmarvellous, as he looked from one to the other of his two\\ncaptors. He looked longest at Tommy.\\n\"You,\" he said beneath his breath. \"YOU! I might have known.\"\\nSeeing that he was disposed to offer no resistance, their grip\\nslackened. Quick as a flash his left hand, the hand which bore\\nthe big signet ring, was raised to his lips....\\n\" \\'Ave, Caesar! te morituri salutant,\\' \" he said, still looking\\nat Tommy.\\nThen his face changed, and with a long convulsive shudder he fell\\nforward in a crumpled heap, whilst an odour of bitter almonds\\nfilled the air.\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\nA SUPPER PARTY AT THE SAVOY\\nTHE supper party given by Mr. Julius Hersheimmer to a few friends\\non the evening of the 30th will long be remembered in catering\\ncircles. It took place in a private room, and Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s\\norders were brief and forcible. He gave carte blanche--and when\\na millionaire gives carte blanche he usually gets it!\\nEvery delicacy out of season was duly provided. Waiters carried\\nbottles of ancient and royal vintage with loving care. The floral\\ndecorations defied the seasons, and fruits of the earth as far\\napart as May and November found themselves miraculously side by\\nside. The list of guests was small and select. The American\\nAmbassador, Mr. Carter, who had taken the liberty, he said, of\\nbringing an old friend, Sir William Beresford, with him,\\nArchdeacon Cowley, Dr. Hall, those two youthful adventurers, Miss\\nPrudence Cowley and Mr. Thomas Beresford, and last, but not\\nleast, as guest of honour, Miss Jane Finn.\\nJulius had spared no pains to make Jane\\'s appearance a success. A\\nmysterious knock had brought Tuppence to the door of the\\napartment she was sharing with the American girl. It was Julius.\\nIn his hand he held a cheque.\\n\"Say, Tuppence,\" he began, \"will you do me a good turn? Take\\nthis, and get Jane regularly togged up for this evening. You\\'re\\nall coming to supper with me at the Savoy. See? Spare no\\nexpense. You get me?\"\\n\"Sure thing,\" mimicked Tuppence. \"We shall enjoy ourselves. It\\nwill be a pleasure dressing Jane. She\\'s the loveliest thing I\\'ve\\never seen.\"\\n\"That\\'s so,\" agreed Mr. Hersheimmer fervently.\\nHis fervour brought a momentary twinkle to Tuppence\\'s eye.\\n\"By the way, Julius,\" she remarked demurely, \"I--haven\\'t given\\nyou my answer yet.\"\\n\"Answer?\" said Julius. His face paled.\\n\"You know--when you asked me to--marry you,\" faltered Tuppence,\\nher eyes downcast in the true manner of the early Victorian\\nheroine, \"and wouldn\\'t take no for an answer. I\\'ve thought it\\nwell over----\"\\n\"Yes?\" said Julius. The perspiration stood on his forehead.\\nTuppence relented suddenly.\\n\"You great idiot!\" she said. \"What on earth induced you to do\\nit? I could see at the time you didn\\'t care a twopenny dip for\\nme!\"\\n\"Not at all. I had--and still have--the highest sentiments of\\nesteem and respect--and admiration for you----\"\\n\"H\\'m!\" said Tuppence. \"Those are the kind of sentiments that\\nvery soon go to the wall when the other sentiment comes along!\\nDon\\'t they, old thing?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know what you mean,\" said Julius stiffly, but a large\\nand burning blush overspread his countenance.\\n\"Shucks!\" retorted Tuppence. She laughed, and closed the door,\\nreopening it to add with dignity: \"Morally, I shall always\\nconsider I have been jilted!\"\\n\"What was it?\" asked Jane as Tuppence rejoined her.\\n\"Julius.\"\\n\"What did he want?\"\\n\"Really, I think, he wanted to see you, but I wasn\\'t going to let\\nhim. Not until to-night, when you\\'re going to burst upon every\\none like King Solomon in his glory! Come on! WE\\'RE GOING TO\\nSHOP!\"\\nTo most people the 29th, the much-heralded \"Labour Day,\" had\\npassed much as any other day. Speeches were made in the Park and\\nTrafalgar Square. Straggling processions, singing the Red Flag,\\nwandered through the streets in a more or less aimless manner.\\nNewspapers which had hinted at a general strike, and the\\ninauguration of a reign of terror, were forced to hide their\\ndiminished heads. The bolder and more astute among them sought to\\nprove that peace had been effected by following their counsels.\\nIn the Sunday papers a brief notice of the sudden death of Sir\\nJames Peel Edgerton, the famous K.C., had appeared. Monday\\'s\\npaper dealt appreciatively with the dead man\\'s career. The exact\\nmanner of his sudden death was never made public.\\nTommy had been right in his forecast of the situation. It had\\nbeen a one-man show. Deprived of their chief, the organization\\nfell to pieces. Kramenin had made a precipitate return to Russia,\\nleaving England early on Sunday morning. The gang had fled from\\nAstley Priors in a panic, leaving behind, in their haste, various\\ndamaging documents which compromised them hopelessly. With these\\nproofs of conspiracy in their hands, aided further by a small\\nbrown diary taken from the pocket of the dead man which had\\ncontained a full and damning resume of the whole plot, the\\nGovernment had called an eleventh-hour conference. The Labour\\nleaders were forced to recognize that they had been used as a\\ncat\\'s paw. Certain concessions were made by the Government, and\\nwere eagerly accepted. It was to be Peace, not War!\\nBut the Cabinet knew by how narrow a margin they had escaped\\nutter disaster. And burnt in on Mr. Carter\\'s brain was the\\nstrange scene which had taken place in the house in Soho the\\nnight before.\\nHe had entered the squalid room to find that great man, the\\nfriend of a lifetime, dead--betrayed out of his own mouth. From\\nthe dead man\\'s pocket-book he had retrieved the ill-omened draft\\ntreaty, and then and there, in the presence of the other three,\\nit had been reduced to ashes.... England was saved!\\nAnd now, on the evening of the 30th, in a private room at the\\nSavoy, Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was receiving his guests.\\nMr. Carter was the first to arrive. With him was a\\ncholeric-looking old gentleman, at sight of whom Tommy flushed up\\nto the roots of his hair. He came forward.\\n\"Ha!\" said the old gentleman, surveying him apoplectically. \"So\\nyou\\'re my nephew, are you? Not much to look at--but you\\'ve done\\ngood work, it seems. Your mother must have brought you up well\\nafter all. Shall we let bygones be bygones, eh? You\\'re my heir,\\nyou know; and in future I propose to make you an allowance--and\\nyou can look upon Chalmers Park as your home.\"\\n\"Thank you, sir, it\\'s awfully decent of you.\"\\n\"Where\\'s this young lady I\\'ve been hearing such a lot about?\"\\nTommy introduced Tuppence.\\n\"Ha!\" said Sir William, eyeing her. \"Girls aren\\'t what they used\\nto be in my young days.\"\\n\"Yes, they are,\" said Tuppence. \"Their clothes are different,\\nperhaps, but they themselves are just the same.\"\\n\"Well, perhaps you\\'re right. Minxes then--minxes now!\"\\n\"That\\'s it,\" said Tuppence. \"I\\'m a frightful minx myself.\"\\n\"I believe you,\" said the old gentleman, chuckling, and pinched\\nher ear in high good-humour. Most young women were terrified of\\nthe \"old bear,\" as they termed him. Tuppence\\'s pertness\\ndelighted the old misogynist.\\nThen came the timid archdeacon, a little bewildered by the\\ncompany in which he found himself, glad that his daughter was\\nconsidered to have distinguished herself, but unable to help\\nglancing at her from time to time with nervous apprehension. But\\nTuppence behaved admirably. She forbore to cross her legs, set a\\nguard upon her tongue, and steadfastly refused to smoke.\\nDr. Hall came next, and he was followed by the American\\nAmbassador.\\n\"We might as well sit down,\" said Julius, when he had introduced\\nall his guests to each other. \"Tuppence, will you \"\\nHe indicated the place of honour with a wave of his hand.\\nBut Tuppence shook her head.\\n\"No--that\\'s Jane\\'s place! When one thinks of how she\\'s held out\\nall these years, she ought to be made the queen of the feast\\nto-night.\"\\nJulius flung her a grateful glance, and Jane came forward shyly\\nto the allotted seat. Beautiful as she had seemed before, it was\\nas nothing to the loveliness that now went fully adorned.\\nTuppence had performed her part faithfully. The model gown\\nsupplied by a famous dressmaker had been entitled \"A tiger lily.\"\\nIt was all golds and reds and browns, and out of it rose the pure\\ncolumn of the girl\\'s white throat, and the bronze masses of hair\\nthat crowned her lovely head. There was admiration in every eye,\\nas she took her seat.\\nSoon the supper party was in full swing, and with one accord\\nTommy was called upon for a full and complete explanation.\\n\"You\\'ve been too darned close about the whole business,\" Julius\\naccused him. \"You let on to me that you were off to the\\nArgentine--though I guess you had your reasons for that. The idea\\nof both you and Tuppence casting me for the part of Mr. Brown\\njust tickles me to death!\"\\n\"The idea was not original to them,\" said Mr. Carter gravely. \"It\\nwas suggested, and the poison very carefully instilled, by a\\npast-master in the art. The paragraph in the New York paper\\nsuggested the plan to him, and by means of it he wove a web that\\nnearly enmeshed you fatally.\"\\n\"I never liked him,\" said Julius. \"I felt from the first that\\nthere was something wrong about him, and I always suspected that\\nit was he who silenced Mrs. Vandemeyer so appositely. But it\\nwasn\\'t till I heard that the order for Tommy\\'s execution came\\nright on the heels of our interview with him that Sunday that I\\nbegan to tumble to the fact that he was the big bug himself.\"\\n\"I never suspected it at all,\" lamented Tuppence. \"I\\'ve always\\nthought I was so much cleverer than Tommy--but he\\'s undoubtedly\\nscored over me handsomely.\"\\nJulius agreed.\\n\"Tommy\\'s been the goods this trip! And, instead of sitting there\\nas dumb as a fish, let him banish his blushes, and tell us all\\nabout it.\"\\n\"Hear! hear!\"\\n\"There\\'s nothing to tell,\" said Tommy, acutely uncomfortable. \"I\\nwas an awful mug--right up to the time I found that photograph of\\nAnnette, and realized that she was Jane Finn. Then I remembered\\nhow persistently she had shouted out that word \\'Marguerite\\'--and\\nI thought of the pictures, and--well, that\\'s that. Then of course\\nI went over the whole thing to see where I\\'d made an ass of\\nmyself.\"\\n\"Go on,\" said Mr. Carter, as Tommy showed signs of taking refuge\\nin silence once more.\\n\"That business about Mrs. Vandemeyer had worried me when Julius\\ntold me about it. On the face of it, it seemed that he or Sir\\nJames must have done the trick. But I didn\\'t know which.\\nFinding that photograph in the drawer, after that story of how it\\nhad been got from him by Inspector Brown, made me suspect Julius.\\nThen I remembered that it was Sir James who had discovered the\\nfalse Jane Finn. In the end, I couldn\\'t make up my mind--and\\njust decided to take no chances either way. I left a note for\\nJulius, in case he was Mr. Brown, saying I was off to the\\nArgentine, and I dropped Sir James\\'s letter with the offer of the\\njob by the desk so that he would see it was a genuine stunt.\\nThen I wrote my letter to Mr. Carter and rang up Sir James.\\nTaking him into my confidence would be the best thing either way,\\nso I told him everything except where I believed the papers to be\\nhidden. The way he helped me to get on the track of Tuppence and\\nAnnette almost disarmed me, but not quite. I kept my mind open\\nbetween the two of them. And then I got a bogus note from\\nTuppence--and I knew!\"\\n\"But how?\"\\nTommy took the note in question from his pocket and passed it\\nround the table.\\n\"It\\'s her handwriting all right, but I knew it wasn\\'t from her\\nbecause of the signature. She\\'d never spell her name \\'Twopence,\\'\\nbut anyone who\\'d never seen it written might quite easily do so.\\nJulius HAD seen it--he showed me a note of hers to him once--but\\nSIR JAMES HADN\\'T! After that everything was plain sailing. I sent\\noff Albert post-haste to Mr. Carter. I pretended to go away, but\\ndoubled back again. When Julius came bursting up in his car, I\\nfelt it wasn\\'t part of Mr. Brown\\'s plan--and that there would\\nprobably be trouble. Unless Sir James was actually caught in the\\nact, so to speak, I knew Mr. Carter would never believe it of him\\non my bare word----\"\\n\"I didn\\'t,\" interposed Mr. Carter ruefully.\\n\"That\\'s why I sent the girls off to Sir James. I was sure they\\'d\\nfetch up at the house in Soho sooner or later. I threatened\\nJulius with the revolver, because I wanted Tuppence to repeat\\nthat to Sir James, so that he wouldn\\'t worry about us. The moment\\nthe girls were out of sight I told Julius to drive like hell for\\nLondon, and as we went along I told him the whole story. We got\\nto the Soho house in plenty of time and met Mr. Carter outside.\\nAfter arranging things with him we went in and hid behind the\\ncurtain in the recess. The policemen had orders to say, if they\\nwere asked, that no one had gone into the house. That\\'s all.\"\\nAnd Tommy came to an abrupt halt.\\nThere was silence for a moment.\\n\"By the way,\" said Julius suddenly, \"you\\'re all wrong about that\\nphotograph of Jane. It WAS taken from me, but I found it again.\"\\n\"Where?\" cried Tuppence.\\n\"In that little safe on the wall in Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s bedroom.\"\\n\"I knew you found something,\" said Tuppence reproachfully. \"To\\ntell you the truth, that\\'s what started me off suspecting you.\\nWhy didn\\'t you say?\"\\n\"I guess I was a mite suspicious too. It had been got away from\\nme once, and I determined I wouldn\\'t let on I\\'d got it until a\\nphotographer had made a dozen copies of it!\"\\n\"We all kept back something or other,\" said Tuppence\\nthoughtfully. \"I suppose secret service work makes you like\\nthat!\"\\nIn the pause that ensued, Mr. Carter took from his pocket a small\\nshabby brown book.\\n\"Beresford has just said that I would not have believed Sir James\\nPeel Edgerton to be guilty unless, so to speak, he was caught in\\nthe act. That is so. Indeed, not until I read the entries in\\nthis little book could I bring myself fully to credit the amazing\\ntruth. This book will pass into the possession of Scotland Yard,\\nbut it will never be publicly exhibited. Sir James\\'s long\\nassociation with the law would make it undesirable. But to you,\\nwho know the truth, I propose to read certain passages which will\\nthrow some light on the extraordinary mentality of this great\\nman.\"\\nHe opened the book, and turned the thin pages.\\n\". . . It is madness to keep this book. I know that. It is\\ndocumentary evidence against me. But I have never shrunk from\\ntaking risks. And I feel an urgent need for self-expression....\\nThe book will only be taken from my dead body....\\n\". . . From an early age I realized that I had exceptional\\nabilities. Only a fool underestimates his capabilities. My brain\\npower was greatly above the average. I know that I was born to\\nsucceed. My appearance was the only thing against me. I was\\nquiet and insignificant--utterly nondescript....\\n\". . . When I was a boy I heard a famous murder trial. I was\\ndeeply impressed by the power and eloquence of the counsel for\\nthe defence. For the first time I entertained the idea of taking\\nmy talents to that particular market.... Then I studied the\\ncriminal in the dock.... The man was a fool--he had been\\nincredibly, unbelievably stupid. Even the eloquence of his\\ncounsel was hardly likely to save him. I felt an immeasurable\\ncontempt for him.... Then it occurred to me that the criminal\\nstandard was a low one. It was the wastrels, the failures, the\\ngeneral riff-raff of civilization who drifted into crime....\\nStrange that men of brains had never realized its extraordinary\\nopportunities.... I played with the idea.... What a magnificent\\nfield--what unlimited possibilities! It made my brain reel....\\n\". . . I read standard works on crime and criminals. They all\\nconfirmed my opinion. Degeneracy, disease--never the deliberate\\nembracing of a career by a far-seeing man. Then I considered.\\nSupposing my utmost ambitions were realized--that I was called to\\nthe bar, and rose to the height of my profession? That I entered\\npolitics--say, even, that I became Prime Minister of England?\\nWhat then? Was that power? Hampered at every turn by my\\ncolleagues, fettered by the democratic system of which I should\\nbe the mere figurehead! No--the power I dreamed of was absolute!\\nAn autocrat! A dictator! And such power could only be obtained\\nby working outside the law. To play on the weaknesses of human\\nnature, then on the weaknesses of nations--to get together and\\ncontrol a vast organization, and finally to overthrow the\\nexisting order, and rule! The thought intoxicated me....\\n\". . . I saw that I must lead two lives. A man like myself is\\nbound to attract notice. I must have a successful career which\\nwould mask my true activities.... Also I must cultivate a\\npersonality. I modelled myself upon famous K.C.\\'s. I reproduced\\ntheir mannerisms, their magnetism. If I had chosen to be an\\nactor, I should have been the greatest actor living! No\\ndisguises--no grease paint--no false beards! Personality! I put\\nit on like a glove! When I shed it, I was myself, quiet,\\nunobtrusive, a man like every other man. I called myself Mr.\\nBrown. There are hundreds of men called Brown--there are\\nhundreds of men looking just like me....\\n\". . . I succeeded in my false career. I was bound to succeed. I\\nshall succeed in the other. A man like me cannot fail....\\n\". . . I have been reading a life of Napoleon. He and I have\\nmuch in common....\\n\". . . I make a practice of defending criminals. A man should\\nlook after his own people....\\n\". . . Once or twice I have felt afraid. The first time was in\\nItaly. There was a dinner given. Professor D----, the great\\nalienist, was present. The talk fell on insanity. He said, \\'A\\ngreat many men are mad, and no one knows it. They do not know it\\nthemselves.\\' I do not understand why he looked at me when he\\nsaid that. His glance was strange.... I did not like it....\\n\". . . The war has disturbed me.... I thought it would further my\\nplans. The Germans are so efficient. Their spy system, too, was\\nexcellent. The streets are full of these boys in khaki. All\\nempty-headed young fools.... Yet I do not know.... They won the\\nwar.... It disturbs me....\\n\". . . My plans are going well.... A girl butted in--I do not\\nthink she really knew anything.... But we must give up the\\nEsthonia.... No risks now....\\n\". . . . All goes well. The loss of memory is vexing. It cannot\\nbe a fake. No girl could deceive ME! . . .\\n\". . .The 29th.... That is very soon....\" Mr. Carter paused.\\n\"I will not read the details of the coup that was planned. But\\nthere are just two small entries that refer to the three of you.\\nIn the light of what happened they are interesting.\\n\". . . By inducing the girl to come to me of her own accord, I\\nhave succeeded in disarming her. But she has intuitive flashes\\nthat might be dangerous.... She must be got out of the way.... I\\ncan do nothing with the American. He suspects and dislikes me.\\nBut he cannot know. I fancy my armour is impregnable....\\nSometimes I fear I have underestimated the other boy. He is not\\nclever, but it is hard to blind his eyes to facts....\"\\nMr. Carter shut the book.\\n\"A great man,\" he said. \"Genius, or insanity, who can say?\"\\nThere was silence.\\nThen Mr. Carter rose to his feet.\\n\"I will give you a toast. The Joint Venture which has so amply\\njustified itself by success!\"\\nIt was drunk with acclamation.\\n\"There\\'s something more we want to hear,\" continued Mr. Carter.\\nHe looked at the American Ambassador. \"I speak for you also, I\\nknow. We\\'ll ask Miss Jane Finn to tell us the story that only\\nMiss Tuppence has heard so far--but before we do so we\\'ll drink\\nher health. The health of one of the bravest of America\\'s\\ndaughters, to whom is due the thanks and gratitude of two great\\ncountries!\"\\nCHAPTER XXVIII\\nAND AFTER\\n\"THAT was a mighty good toast, Jane,\" said Mr. Hersheimmer, as he\\nand his cousin were being driven back in the Rolls-Royce to the\\nRitz.\\n\"The one to the joint venture?\"\\n\"No--the one to you. There isn\\'t another girl in the world who\\ncould have carried it through as you did. You were just\\nwonderful!\"\\nJane shook her head.\\n\"I don\\'t feel wonderful. At heart I\\'m just tired and\\nlonesome--and longing for my own country.\"\\n\"That brings me to something I wanted to say. I heard the\\nAmbassador telling you his wife hoped you would come to them at\\nthe Embassy right away. That\\'s good enough, but I\\'ve got another\\nplan. Jane--I want you to marry me! Don\\'t get scared and say no\\nat once. You can\\'t love me right away, of course, that\\'s\\nimpossible. But I\\'ve loved you from the very moment I set eyes\\non your photo--and now I\\'ve seen you I\\'m simply crazy about you!\\nIf you\\'ll only marry me, I won\\'t worry you any--you shall take\\nyour own time. Maybe you\\'ll never come to love me, and if that\\'s\\nthe case I\\'ll manage to set you free. But I want the right to\\nlook after you, and take care of you.\"\\n\"That\\'s what I want,\" said the girl wistfully. \"Some one who\\'ll\\nbe good to me. Oh, you don\\'t know how lonesome I feel!\"\\n\"Sure thing I do. Then I guess that\\'s all fixed up, and I\\'ll see\\nthe archbishop about a special license to-morrow morning.\"\\n\"Oh, Julius!\"\\n\"Well, I don\\'t want to hustle you any, Jane, but there\\'s no sense\\nin waiting about. Don\\'t be scared--I shan\\'t expect you to love\\nme all at once.\"\\nBut a small hand was slipped into his.\\n\"I love you now, Julius,\" said Jane Finn. \"I loved you that\\nfirst moment in the car when the bullet grazed your cheek....\"\\nFive minutes later Jane murmured softly:\\n\"I don\\'t know London very well, Julius, but is it such a very\\nlong way from the Savoy to the Ritz?\"\\n\"It depends how you go,\" explained Julius unblushingly. \"We\\'re\\ngoing by way of Regent\\'s Park!\"\\n\"Oh, Julius--what will the chauffeur think?\"\\n\"At the wages I pay him, he knows better than to do any\\nindependent thinking. Why, Jane, the only reason I had the\\nsupper at the Savoy was so that I could drive you home. I didn\\'t\\nsee how I was ever going to get hold of you alone. You and\\nTuppence have been sticking together like Siamese twins. I guess\\nanother day of it would have driven me and Beresford stark\\nstaring mad!\"\\n\"Oh. Is he----?\"\\n\"Of course he is. Head over ears.\"\\n\"I thought so,\" said Jane thoughtfully.\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"From all the things Tuppence didn\\'t say!\"\\n\"There you have me beat,\" said Mr. Hersheimmer. But Jane only\\nlaughed.\\nIn the meantime, the Young Adventurers were sitting bolt upright,\\nvery stiff and ill at ease, in a taxi which, with a singular lack\\nof originality, was also returning to the Ritz via Regent\\'s Park.\\nA terrible constraint seemed to have settled down between them.\\nWithout quite knowing what had happened, everything seemed\\nchanged. They were tongue-tied--paralysed. All the old\\ncamaraderie was gone.\\nTuppence could think of nothing to say.\\nTommy was equally afflicted.\\nThey sat very straight and forbore to look at each other.\\nAt last Tuppence made a desperate effort.\\n\"Rather fun, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\"Rather.\"\\nAnother silence.\\n\"I like Julius,\" essayed Tuppence again.\\nTommy was suddenly galvanized into life.\\n\"You\\'re not going to marry him, do you hear?\" he said\\ndictatorially. \"I forbid it.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence meekly.\\n\"Absolutely, you understand.\"\\n\"He doesn\\'t want to marry me--he really only asked me out of\\nkindness.\"\\n\"That\\'s not very likely,\" scoffed Tommy.\\n\"It\\'s quite true. He\\'s head over ears in love with Jane. I\\nexpect he\\'s proposing to her now.\"\\n\"She\\'ll do for him very nicely,\" said Tommy condescendingly.\\n\"Don\\'t you think she\\'s the most lovely creature you\\'ve ever\\nseen?\"\\n\"Oh, I dare say.\"\\n\"But I suppose you prefer sterling worth,\" said Tuppence\\ndemurely.\\n\"I--oh, dash it all, Tuppence, you know!\"\\n\"I like your uncle, Tommy,\" said Tuppence, hastily creating a\\ndiversion. \"By the way, what are you going to do, accept Mr.\\nCarter\\'s offer of a Government job, or accept Julius\\'s invitation\\nand take a richly remunerated post in America on his ranch?\"\\n\"I shall stick to the old ship, I think, though it\\'s awfully good\\nof Hersheimmer. But I feel you\\'d be more at home in London.\"\\n\"I don\\'t see where I come in.\"\\n\"I do,\" said Tommy positively.\\nTuppence stole a glance at him sideways.\\n\"There\\'s the money, too,\" she observed thoughtfully.\\n\"What money?\"\\n\"We\\'re going to get a cheque each. Mr. Carter told me so.\"\\n\"Did you ask how much?\" inquired Tommy sarcastically.\\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence triumphantly. \"But I shan\\'t tell you.\"\\n\"Tuppence, you are the limit!\"\\n\"It has been fun, hasn\\'t it, Tommy? I do hope we shall have lots\\nmore adventures.\"\\n\"You\\'re insatiable, Tuppence. I\\'ve had quite enough adventures\\nfor the present.\"\\n\"Well, shopping is almost as good,\" said Tuppence dreamily.\\n\"Think of buying old furniture, and bright carpets, and futurist\\nsilk curtains, and a polished dining-table, and a divan with lots\\nof cushions.\"\\n\"Hold hard,\" said Tommy. \"What\\'s all this for?\"\\n\"Possibly a house--but I think a flat.\"\\n\"Whose flat?\"\\n\"You think I mind saying it, but I don\\'t in the least! OURS, so\\nthere!\"\\n\"You darling!\" cried Tommy, his arms tightly round her. \"I was\\ndetermined to make you say it. I owe you something for the\\nrelentless way you\\'ve squashed me whenever I\\'ve tried to be\\nsentimental.\"\\nTuppence raised her face to his. The taxi proceeded on its\\ncourse round the north side of Regent\\'s Park.\\n\"You haven\\'t really proposed now,\" pointed out Tuppence. \"Not\\nwhat our grandmothers would call a proposal. But after listening\\nto a rotten one like Julius\\'s, I\\'m inclined to let you off.\"\\n\"You won\\'t be able to get out of marrying me, so don\\'t you think\\nit.\"\\n\"What fun it will be,\" responded Tuppence. \"Marriage is called\\nall sorts of things, a haven, and a refuge, and a crowning glory,\\nand a state of bondage, and lots more. But do you know what I\\nthink it is?\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"A sport!\"\\n\"And a damned good sport too,\" said Tommy.\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s Etext of Secret Adversary by Agatha Christie'"
